<p>Grace through Faith, Not Works</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>Paul’s message of justication are treacherous waters to navigate, and </p>
<p>participants tend to get very wet in the process. But the thrill of exploring </p>
<p>the challenging waters of Paul’s theology should encourage us to strap on </p>
<p>the life jacket and grab an oar. I suggest that Paul uses “saved” here rather </p>
<p>than “justied” because the latter term is too restrictive for his meaning. </p>
<p>Said another way, I think Paul has already in so many words conveyed the </p>
<p>concept of justication when he declared that we were made alive with </p>
<p>Christ. God paved the way for new life by rescuing believers from their </p>
<p>life of death, in Christ. is is the beginning of salvation, but it is not its </p>
<p>sum total. New life today and resurrection life to come are a believer’s </p>
<p>secure fortune. In Rom 5:9–10, Paul speaks about justication and salva-</p>
<p>tion, noting that the rst makes way for the second. Justication comes </p>
<p>through Christ’s blood, it establishes the forgiveness of sins (see also Eph </p>
<p>1:7); that aects believers such that salvation from God’s wrath is sure. </p>
<p>Moreover, justication leads to reconciliation with God in the present. In </p>
<p>Ephesians, by using the perfect tense, Paul suggests that the present en-</p>
<p>joyment of God’s salvation and the future assurance of deliverance from </p>
<p>judgment are the benets of each believer. Both Romans and Ephesians </p>
<p>reassure the believer that God’s covenant promises in Christ, in his death </p>
<p>and resurrection, are rm and solid today, and will be on the last day.</p>
<p>Paul describes God’s love and grace extended to believers in terms </p>
<p>of being made alive with, raised with, and seated with Christ. With such </p>
<p>benets bestowed, a believer might begin to feel pretty special—all this </p>
<p>attention, just for me? Paul nips such thoughts in the bud in 2:7. He notes </p>
<p>that God has shown his great love and immeasurable grace to us so that </p>
<p>in the coming ages, from now until Christ returns, and beyond, his kind-</p>
<p>ness will be known. Paul declares that God’s salvation plan was purposed </p>
<p>to declare God’s unmatched generosity to the ages. Most likely Paul is </p>
<p>speaking not just about time, but about the rulers and powers that exist in </p>
<p>that time. Christ’s death and resurrection stand in stark opposition to the </p>
<p>authorities of the present age, and God’s abundant grace extended to hu-</p>
<p>mans leaves the spiritual forces slack-jawed in amazement. Paul reminds </p>
<p>us here that our salvation actually has ramications beyond our personal </p>
<p>and corporate lives in Christ. God’s plan of salvation stands as vindication </p>
<p>of God’s goodness to his creation, his commitment to his covenants and </p>
<p>promises, and his power over all evil.</p>
