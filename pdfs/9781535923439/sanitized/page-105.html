<p>Gentiles and Jews Together in Christ</p>

<p>Testament. e Christian, unlike the devotees of the redemption </p>
<p>myths, has no last line of escape available from earthly tasks and </p>
<p>diculties into the eternal, but, like Christ himself (“my God, why </p>
<p>hast thou forsaken me?”), he must drink the earthly cup to the </p>
<p>dregs, and only in his doing so is the crucied and risen Lord with </p>
<p>him, and he crucied and risen with Christ. is world must not be </p>
<p>prematurely written o; in this the Old and New Testaments are at </p>
<p>one. Redemption myths arise from human boundary-experiences, </p>
<p>but Christ takes hold of a man at the centre of his life.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>ird, the importance of the church as the corporate body of Christ </p>
<p>intrinsic to our salvation helps shape our understanding of forgiveness. </p>
<p>Oen forgiveness is seen as limited to that which is extended by God </p>
<p>to believers. But the blood of Christ not only forgives sins, it makes a </p>
<p>new community where old value assessments are turned on their heads </p>
<p>or tossed out the window. e forgiveness is not just shown by the empty </p>
<p>tomb but also in the new community. And because this is a new commu-</p>
<p>nity by the Spirit, both Jews and Gentiles are equal members. Paul does </p>
<p>not preach a “gospel” message and then tack onto it an optional picture of </p>
<p>a multi-cultural church. Instead, the gospel message in Ephesians unfolds </p>
<p>by stressing forgiveness of sins through Christ’s blood (1:7) as a mystery </p>
<p>(1:9), which in 3:3–10 is further explained as Gentiles becoming heirs </p>
<p>with Jews in Christ. Forgiveness includes not simply a “not guilty” stamp, </p>
<p>but also a new group identity. is reality is an inseparable part of the gos-</p>
pel message, not an optional politically correct stance. A unied diverse
<p>church is God’s plan of redemption.</p>
<p>In 3:13, Paul asks his readers not to despair due to his aictions, for </p>
<p>these suerings are their glory.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Notice Paul does not say for your glory.</p>
<p>Paul invites us to ponder the connection between his aictions and glory, </p>
<p>as well as prepares the reader for his doxological prayer that highlights </p>
<p>God’s glory. Paul’s aictions are tied directly to his ministry as an apostle </p>
<p>to the Gentiles. Paul’s imprisonment both testied to his faithful procla-</p>
<p>mation of the gospel, and worried the Ephesians that a similar fate might </p>
<p>await them too. While Paul does not hide the reality of Christian suering, </p>
<p>he also indicates that as an apostle, his call to suer for Christ was part of </p>
<p>the job description (1 Cor 4:9; 2 Cor 11:16–33; 12:11–12). Interestingly, </p>
<p>5. Bonhoeer 1997: 336–37.</p>
<p>6. A less likely reading is that Paul is asking God that he himself will not get </p>
<p>discouraged.</p>
