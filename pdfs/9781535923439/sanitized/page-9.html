<p>Preface</p>
<p>Ambrosiaster</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>does well in trying to capture the volume and brilliance of</p>
<p>the vision of the Triune God expounded in the six chapters of Ephesians. </p>
<p>Pointing to the phrase “length and breadth and depth and height” (3:18), </p>
<p>he asks his readers to think of a sphere, whose length is the same as its </p>
<p>breadth, and whose depth is the same as its height. He rejoices that the </p>
<p>same is true of God, who is boundlessly innite. Ambrosiaster observes </p>
<p>that we cannot thank God enough who, being innite and innitely </p>
<p>great, yet made possible humanity’s redemption through Christ. Julian of </p>
<p>Norwich had a vision of a dierent sort of sphere, specically a hazelnut, </p>
<p>which seemed so small and insignicant that it might disintegrate into </p>
<p>nothingness. is nut symbolized the universe in relationship to God, </p>
<p>and she marveled that God would care for something so relatively incon-</p>
<p>sequential. But she understood that it was God’s vast love which sustained </p>
<p>it. In meditating on the great love of God shown in his redemption of </p>
<p>humanity from sin, she cried that “all shall be well, and all shall be well, </p>
<p>and all manner of thing shall be well.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>e Letter to the Ephesians invites its readers to sing with Julian that </p>
<p>all shall be well. In this epistle, sin has been overcome by Christ’s death on </p>
<p>the cross. Saved by God’s grace through faith, Christians are seated with </p>
<p>Christ in the heavens. ey enjoy full fellowship through Christ’s work in </p>
<p>making the two (Jew and Gentile) into one holy people, a temple of the </p>
<p>Lord, the Body of Christ. Sealed with the Holy Spirit, they are empowered </p>
<p>for holy living.</p>
<p>It has been my joy to wade into this epistle, with its exuberant, ex-</p>
<p>travagant language that, like a stained glass window lit up by the sun’s </p>
<p>rays, casts a radiant picture of God and his church. I oer my deepest </p>
<p>thanks to Craig Keener and Michael Bird for their invitation to partici-</p>
<p>pate in the New Covenant Commentary Series. eir shrewd comments </p>
<p>helped me think more clearly and strengthened my arguments. My sin-</p>
