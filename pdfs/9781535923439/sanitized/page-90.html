<p>Ephesians 2:14–18</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>Paul is encouraging his readers to take in the full eect of their reconcili-</p>
<p>ation through Christ’s cross. Salvation is not simply a vertical relation-</p>
<p>ship between God and humans that is restored and enhanced, to which </p>
<p>an ultimately optional horizontal aspect is added. is false dichotomy </p>
<p>separates what in Paul’s mind is a unity.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>e relationship believers have</p>
<p>with God in Christ is evidenced by living the new creation life here and </p>
<p>now. No new creation, no reconciliation. God is intent on redeeming and </p>
<p>reconciling all creation, including his image bearers (humans) who by </p>
<p>faith are in Christ.</p>
<p>Christ Breaks Down the Dividing Wall</p>
<p>Paul builds his argument by explaining that Christ has done three things: </p>
he has made the two one, he has broken down the dividing wall, and
<p>he has annulled the law of the commandments. Taking a closer look at </p>
<p>these accomplishments, we can be comfortably sure that the two entities </p>
made one are Jew and Gentile, but the dividing wall is more dicult to
<p>interpret. Perhaps Paul is constructing a metaphor that will interact with </p>
<p>a second picture at the end of the chapter, namely the building up of God’s </p>
<p>temple (2:21–22). It is also possible that Paul is alluding to the wall of </p>
<p>separation in the Jerusalem temple. e diculty is that Paul uses two </p>
<p>terms for this wall; he speaks of the middle wall of the fence, wall, or bar-</p>
<p>rier. Why use such an elaborate phrase? Perhaps it is referencing a specic </p>
<p>image, such as the barrier that excludes Gentiles from the Jewish area </p>
<p>of the temple. is wall was in the midst of the temple precinct, hence </p>
<p>it might be described as a “middle wall.” It also served as a barrier or </p>
<p>fence to keep out the ritually unclean (Gentiles) from a pure, sacred space </p>
<p>reserved for Jews.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Although this wall still stood in Paul’s day, he insists that in Christ </p>
<p>both Jew and Gentile have full access to God. Paul probably preached </p>
<p>something of the sort, if accusations against him are anything to go on. In </p>
<p>Acts 21:28–29, certain Jews from the province of Asia (Ephesus is located </p>
<p>here) accuse Paul of bringing Greeks into the temple, thereby deling it. </p>
<p>Since Gentiles were permitted in the outer court of the temple, the accusa-</p>
<p>tion must be alleging that Paul took Gentiles beyond the barrier. Such an </p>
