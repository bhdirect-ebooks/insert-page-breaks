<p>Ephesians 2:1–10</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>other’s burdens (Gal 6:2), resisting sin (1 Cor 10:12–13), loving enemies </p>
<p>(Luke 6:32–36), and living by the Spirit (Rom 14:17–18) are laid out in </p>
<p>the New Testament as responsibilities to be carried out by followers of </p>
<p>Jesus.</p>
<p>ese behaviors, attitudes, and sympathies are to be as natural as </p>
<p>walking. Indeed, Paul states that we are to walk in these good works. </p>
<p>Interestingly, in 2:1, Paul indicates that the Gentiles walk in their tres-</p>
<p>passes and sins, in what amounts to a death march. But believers walk in </p>
<p>newness of life, moving from one good, holy, blessed action or attitude </p>
<p>to another, step by step, bringing God glory in all things. e image of </p>
<p>the Christian life as a walk occurs frequently in Paul. He admonishes the </p>
<p>Galatians to walk by the Spirit (5:16) and keep in step with the Spirit </p>
<p>(5:25, see also Rom 6:4; 8:4; 2 Cor 5:2; Phil 3:17; Col 1:10). In Ephesians </p>
<p>Paul repeatedly asks that they walk worthy of their calling (4:1, 17; 5:2, 8, </p>
<p>15). Some translations (including the TNIV) render the Greek as “live” </p>
<p>rather than “walk,” which might lose a bit of the sense of energy, direc-</p>
<p>tion, and purpose assumed in the term “walk.” More so in Paul’s time </p>
<p>than now, walking was the way one supported life: people walked their </p>
<p>animals to the elds and back home, they walked to get water, to attend </p>
<p>synagogue or festivals, to plant and harvest crops. Life depended upon </p>
<p>walking. Everyone knew that to walk was to live, and to live was to walk </p>
<p>(or have a servant do the walking for you). e image of walking in the </p>
<p>Spirit, or walking in good works, was a natural way of saying how the </p>
<p>believer’s new life, the life of a new creature, was to be nourished and </p>
<p>maintained.</p>
<p>If Paul’s life is anything to go on, walking in good works is hard, </p>
<p>scary, exhilarating, and exhausting all at once. Paul does not say that God </p>
<p>will smooth out the path, or keep the weather sunny and the wind to the </p>
<p>back. Paul is walking, doing, being in real time under the power of the </p>
<p>Spirit. e Spirit did not carry Paul as a parent might do for a toddler; </p>
<p>Paul was walking, acting, choosing, but not alone. Always within, around, </p>
<p>and beside is the God who saves—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
