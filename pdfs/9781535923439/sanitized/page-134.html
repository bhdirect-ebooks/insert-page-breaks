<p>EphEsians 5</p>
<p>Walking as Christ Walked (5:1–20)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Follow God’s example, therefore, as dearly loved children </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and </p>
<p>gave himself up for us as a fragrant oering and sacrice to </p>
<p>God. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual </p>
<p>immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because </p>
<p>these are improper for the Lord’s people. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Nor should there </p>
<p>be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of </p>
<p>place, but rather thanksgiving. </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>For of this you can be sure: </p>
<p>No immoral, impure or greedy person—such a person is an </p>
<p>idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of </p>
<p>God. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because </p>
<p>of such things God’s wrath comes on those who are disobedi-</p>
<p>ent. </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>erefore do not be partners with them. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>For you were </p>
<p>once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as chil-</p>
<p>dren of light </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>(for the fruit of the light consists in all good-</p>
<p>ness, righteousness, and truth) </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>and nd out what pleases </p>
<p>the Lord. </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of </p>
<p>darkness, but rather expose them. </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>It is shameful even to </p>
<p>mention what the disobedient do in secret. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>But everything </p>
<p>exposed by the light becomes visible—and everything that is </p>
<p>illuminated becomes a light. </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>is is why it is said:</p>
<p>“Wake up, sleeper,</p>
<p>rise from the dead,</p>
<p>and Christ will shine on you.”</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as </p>
<p>wise, </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>making the most of every opportunity, because the </p>
<p>days are evil. </p>
<p>17</p>
<p>erefore do not be foolish, but understand </p>
