<p>One Calling by the One God</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>conrm our resurrection hope that all will be made new is to reect on </p>
<p>the reality of Christ’s body, the church.</p>
<p>In 4:1, 4, Paul describes God’s call having a calling on the Ephesians’ </p>
<p>lives. In classical Greek, calling meant a summons to court or an invita-</p>
<p>tion to a feast. So we might rephrase Paul here to say that God summons </p>
<p>with a summons or God invites with a particular message of invitation, </p>
<p>namely the gospel message of Jesus Christ. Paul uses the term calling in </p>
<p>1 Cor 7:20, where Paul exhorts the Corinthians not to seek to change </p>
<p>their social status aer they were called by God, for whether or not one </p>
<p>was a slave when called, in the Lord all are free. Likewise in Phil 3:14 we </p>
<p>have a sense of invitation, wherein Paul speaks of forgetting what is past </p>
<p>and straining towards the future, the upward call of God. Further under-</p>
<p>standing of calling is found in Rom 11:29, “for God’s gi and his call are </p>
<p>irrevocable.” e context is the oneness of Jew and Gentile in Christ and </p>
<p>the conviction that God has not abandoned his people, but has enlarged </p>
<p>their numbers (by including Gentiles) through Christ.</p>
<p>In 4:4–6, Paul explains why unity and oneness are critical to the </p>
<p>church’s witness by listing seven “ones” that form the basis for the church’s </p>
<p>oneness in Spirit. Paul expresses a similar thought in 1 Cor 8:6, wherein </p>
<p>he contrasts the pagan acceptance of many gods and the Christian (and </p>
<p>Jewish) steadfast stand on monotheism. us when the church lacks unity, </p>
<p>it calls into question its proclamation of the oneness of God. e oneness </p>
<p>of God is not an intellectual belief only. James 2:19 warns that even the </p>
<p>demons believe God is one, and they shudder. e unity or oneness is of </p>
<p>a certain type, namely Trinitarian. Without putting too ne a point on it, </p>
<p>the three Persons in one Godhead provides a picture of the oneness of the </p>
diverse elements in the church—Jew, Gentile; slave, free; male, female.
<p>e Gi to Grow On (4:7–16)</p>
<p>Paul begins a new thought with the qualier “but” (de) as he digs deeper </p>
<p>into the subject of unity. ough there is one call to be the one body </p>
of Christ in one faith and baptism, the individual believer is not lost in
<p>some sort of great collective. Each believer is given grace by Christ, who, </p>
<p>having both descended and ascended, has the authority to give gis. Paul </p>
<p>expounds what was given, why it was given, how long the gis are to be in </p>
<p>eect, and then returns to explain from another angle why his gis are so </p>
<p>crucial to the church. e themes of unity, love, and Christian maturity </p>
