<p>le Corinth and headed to Ephesus, where it appears the couple remained </p>
<p>for some years.</p>
<p>We nd them mentioned again by Paul in his letter to the Romans </p>
<p>(16:3–4). is curiosity has prompted the theory that Rom 16 was ac-</p>
<p>tually sent to the Ephesians, perhaps as a letter of recommendation for </p>
<p>Phoebe, the deacon of Cenchreae. Textual evidence is called upon to </p>
<p>support this theory: the earliest copy of Romans (P</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>) includes chapter </p>
<p>16 aer the doxology of 16:25–27, for example, suggesting the names </p>
<p>were attached by a later copyist. If this reconstruction is accurate, then </p>
<p>we have a decidedly clearer picture of some who populated the Ephesian </p>
<p>church. However, serious doubts are raised, including that every ancient </p>
<p>manuscript contains the listing. And we have every reason to suppose </p>
<p>that Priscilla and Aquila, with Claudius’s edict rescinded, returned to </p>
<p>Rome along with many of their Jewish compatriots. In Paul’s other let-</p>
<p>ters to churches he started, he does not oer a list of people to receive </p>
<p>his greetings (see Galatians, Philippians, 1 and 2 essalonians, 1 and 2 </p>
<p>Corinthians). Would someone in Ephesus feel snubbed if Paul forgot (or </p>
<p>declined) to mention them by name? Instead, it seems most likely that the </p>
<p>list of names in Rom 16:1–16 was intended for Rome, an opportunity for </p>
<p>Paul to connect with the wider community by noting that he has friends </p>
<p>and acquaintances among them.</p>

<p>e Ephesian letter recipients line up with the social patterns of the </p>
<p>larger Greco-Roman culture. ey are members of families: slaves or </p>
<p>masters, parents, spouses. ey seem to be neither wealthy nor destitute; </p>
<p>indeed, their nancial status is not addressed directly. A sizable number, </p>
<p>perhaps the majority, are Gentile, for Paul speaks of himself and other </p>
<p>Jews as “we” and the letter’s recipients as “you” Gentiles. is distinction </p>
<p>remains crucial for Paul’s argument concerning the advantages wrought </p>
<p>in Christ, namely that through his death he made the two groups one in </p>
<p>the church. Yet it also appears that some members of his ministry team </p>
<p>working in Ephesus were Jewish, including Aquila, Priscilla, Timothy, </p>
<p>Apollos, and perhaps Sosthenes.</p>
