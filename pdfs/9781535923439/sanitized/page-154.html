<p>Ephesians 5:21–33</p>

<p>was common among Jews and promoted by the Greeks and Romans, who </p>
<p>outlawed bigamy. Evidence indicates that a few Jews practiced polygyny, </p>
<p>but that arrangement was not recognized by Roman courts.</p>
<p>For Paul, the unity of the couple, their oneness of esh, is squarely </p>
<p>rooted in the Genesis account. e Greeks and Romans would have ad-</p>
<p>mitted as well that the whole takes precedent over the parts. Aristotle </p>
noted that unity is prior to division. In an example, he noted that a hand
<p>is only a hand if it is connected to a body. If one removes a hand or foot </p>
<p>from the body, they cease to be functional hands or feet but are similar </p>
<p>to sculptured stone.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>us although in his discussion of marriage, Paul</p>
<p>rst notes the distinction between head and body, his conclusions in the </p>
<p>second half of the argument stress unity, from which distinctions can be </p>
<p>made. e quality of dierence makes Paul’s claim of unity so outstand-</p>
<p>ing. As we have seen in previous chapters, the unity of Christ’s body </p>
<p>is made manifest in the oneness of Jew and Gentile. Here the view has </p>
<p>shied slightly, with the emphasis on the unity reected in the oneness of </p>
<p>husband and wife. e key note of unity which has sounded throughout </p>
<p>the epistle rises in volume with the marriage metaphor. Even more, Paul </p>
<p>reshapes the body metaphor of husband/wife so that it covers the entire </p>
<p>body of Christ. us the theme of unity and the body/esh metaphors </p>
serve three related images: husband and wife as one esh, individual be-
<p>lievers united in one body, and Christ united with the church, his body.</p>
<p>A surprising possibility emerges from Paul’s argument. If the hus-</p>
<p>band is one esh with his wife, as Paul declares, could the same be said </p>
<p>of the wife to her husband? If the husband loves his wife, who is his own </p>
<p>body, it seems logically possible that the wife could love her husband, </p>
<p>who is her own body.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>A measure of reciprocity is latent in Paul’s image</p>
<p>here, but it is explicit in 1 Cor 7:4, where Paul notes that the wife does </p>
<p>not have authority over her own body, but her husband does, and the </p>
<p>husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. In </p>
<p>the end, both married partners take their identity as members of Christ’s </p>
<p>body, to whom they are united through his love. is is the power of the </p>
<p>gospel, which unsettles the status quo and lis up the humble.</p>
