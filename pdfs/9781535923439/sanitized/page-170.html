<p>spiritual forces of evil” (6:12). e traditional view interprets this group </p>
<p>as spiritual forces or angelic beings in league with the devil. ey are be-</p>
<p>ings who actively seek the demise of believers. A new position emerged </p>
<p>aer the Second World War, which argued that this reference is better </p>
<p>understood to be the political systems, social institutions and structures, </p>
and economic forces that transcend individual actions and decisions.
<p>ese forces are spiritual but impersonal, and exist inextricably within </p>
<p>the political and social structures and institutions of our world. ey do </p>
<p>not have a separate spiritual existence, nor are they simply a personica-</p>
<p>tion of institutions and structures.</p>
<p>e appeal of the newer position lies in its easy accessibility to the </p>
<p>modern Western mind, which reshaped the spiritual world following the </p>
<p>Enlightenment. Moreover, it takes seriously the structural component of </p>
<p>sin and the abuse of power in economic and political spheres. Additionally, </p>
<p>it has the advantage of exciting the church to action against social injus-</p>
<p>tice and systems of oppression. e narrative behind this position under-</p>
<p>stands the powers as created by God to preserve order in creation and </p>
<p>society, but that these structures and powers defected to evil at the fall and </p>
<p>need redemption. e structures exist mainly in the realm of human life, </p>
<p>and so are redeemable by the church in Christ. us we have Paul’s call to </p>
<p>the church for social action against materialism, racism, and political cor-</p>
<p>ruption—the rulers and powers of our age. However, problems with the </p>
<p>view outweigh its advantages. First, Paul describes these forces as having </p>
<p>personal agency. In Eph 2:2 he describes the ruler of the authority of the </p>
<p>air as actively at work in the people of disobedience (those of this present </p>
<p>age). Second, Paul speaks of evil structures with terms like “world” or </p>
<p>“sin” or “esh”; these forces do not have autonomous existence. While </p>
<p>they are personied, they are not said to ght against God independent </p>
<p>of humanity. Boyd notes, “as much as Paul might see demonic activity </p>
<p>in structural and societal evil, he clearly does not equate the demonic </p>
<p>powers with structural societal evil.”</p>

<p> Finally, the position that under-</p>
<p>stands Paul’s focus to be structural evil oen argues that the church as the </p>
<p>body of Christ is the new incarnation of Christ, now equipped to battle </p>
<p>present institutional evil. ough this incarnational model of the church </p>
<p>rightly sees that the church is Christ’s body, it overstates the evidence by </p>
<p>minimizing the place of its head, Christ. e church is not the new inde-</p>
