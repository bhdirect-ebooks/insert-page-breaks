<p>condent of their redemption in the face of enemy taunts. Finally, the </p>
<p>believer takes up the sword of the Spirit, the word of God. is is not </p>
<p>a word of judgment, but of hope and deliverance. e Greek term for </p>
<p>“word” used here, rhēma, speaks of God’s good news of salvation (5:26, </p>
<p>see also Rom 10:8, 17; Heb 6:5; 1 Pet 1:25). e gospel stands ready on </p>

<p>Fusing the Horizons: Seated with Christ and Standing Firm</p>
<p>Is this picture of believers in battle at odds with the image of being seated </p>
<p>with Christ (2:6)? How can we both be seated with Christ and established </p>
<p>(past tense) with him, and also be asked to stand ﬁrm? In 2:1–7 we have the </p>
<p>scenario wherein the Gentile believers had been part of the present age, and </p>
<p>then God acts out of his great love and mercy and creates life where there </p>
<p>was death. The new life is in Christ, so where he is believers must be as well </p>
<p>because they are each a member of his body. Yet the full reward awaits the </p>
<p>believer, who must negotiate life in a world still operating under the domain of </p>
<p>darkness. Thus a believer is both seated with Christ and yet remains within the </p>
<p>present age, though not bound to it. Perhaps an analogy from marriage would </p>
<p>help. A married person is one with their spouse, yet they occupy separate </p>
<p>space—they can even be on different continents. But they are still one as </p>
<p>they live out faithfully their vows and witness to the truth of that oneness in </p>
<p>their daily activities. In the present age attempts to break apart that oneness </p>
<p>continually press upon the couple, and so spouses form habits which reduce </p>
<p>corrupting inﬂuences, and stand fast against the temptations of immorality.</p>
<p>ree Interpretive Questions (6:10–18)</p>
<p>Several questions emerge upon closer study of the full armor of God im-</p>
<p>age. First, is this a picture of active warfare, or is Paul suggesting a defen-</p>
<p>sive posture? Second, who or what are these powers and principalities? </p>
<p>ird, does this action occur now, or in the future (or both)? Answers to </p>
<p>these questions are interrelated, usually revolving around the proposed </p>
<p>identity of the powers and principalities. In general, there are two under-</p>
<p>standings of the “rulers . . . authorities, powers of this dark age, and . . . </p>
