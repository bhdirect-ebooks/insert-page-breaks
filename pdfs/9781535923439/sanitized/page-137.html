<p>Become Imitators of God</p>

<p>false gods. ese are acts of disobedience, done, not by children of God, </p>
<p>but by “those who are disobedient” (5:6).</p>
<p>e call to walk in love comes with a warning not to be deceived </p>
<p>(5:6). What is this deception and who is promoting it? Paul does not </p>
<p>reveal who might be arguing that sexual and moral impurity, avarice, </p>
<p>and covetousness are of no concern to God. But the deception seems to </p>
<p>be centered on a wrong belief about the kingdom of God. Several times </p>
<p>in his letters, Paul warns his readers that the immoral person will not </p>
<p>inherit God’s kingdom. For example, in 1 Cor 6:1–11, the Corinthians </p>
<p>are chastised for cheating each other, and for failing to resolve such is-</p>
<p>sues within the church. Paul continues with an extensive list of dening </p>
<p>behaviors that expose those who will not inherit God’s kingdom. He adds </p>
<p>that among the Corinthians, some of them were indeed the drunkards </p>
<p>and thieves who had no claim to the kingdom. But, Paul assures them, </p>
<p>they now stand washed, sanctied, and justied in the name of Christ </p>
<p>and by the Holy Spirit (1 Cor 6:11, see also Gal 5:21). Perhaps it is true </p>
<p>in every generation that believers presume on God’s love and assume </p>
<p>that their behavior has no signicance. Paul clearly thought otherwise. </p>
<p>Believers—beloved children— simply do not live out their redeemed life </p>
<p>in a debauched manner.</p>
<p>Become Wise, Be Filled with the Holy Spirit (5:7–16)</p>
<p>In this section Paul issues eight commands as he distinguishes darkness </p>
<p>and light, truth and foolishness, and drunkenness and Spirit-lled living. </p>
<p>e call to walk is given again, this time to walk in light. In total, Paul </p>
<p>oers four calls to walk</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>as a believer in chs. 4 and 5: walk worthily (4:1),</p>
<p>walk in holiness, not as the Gentiles (4:17), walk in love (5:2), and walk </p>
<p>in light (5:8). Moreover, Paul will again use the verb “be/become” (5:7, </p>
<p>17) as he further encourages the believers to live out their new reality in </p>
<p>Christ. Paul uses a familiar metaphor of fruit to describe deeds both good </p>
<p>and bad. He emphasizes light and darkness as stark contrasts of behavior </p>
<p>that serve to dene character. ree times he cautions the Ephesians not </p>
<p>to act one way, but to live in light, understanding, and truth (5:11, 17, 18). </p>
<p>Overall, Paul is concerned that the church (being light) presents a sharp </p>
<p>contrast to the idolatrous darkness of the wider society.</p>
<p>3. TNIV translates the verb in 4:1, 17, and 5:8 as “live.”</p>
