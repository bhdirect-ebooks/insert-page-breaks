<p>Sealed with the Spirit</p>

<p>him (“we”) heard the good news. e contrast between them is based on </p>
<p>when a person heard the good news, but the chronological distinction </p>
<p>hints as well to the salvation pattern enacted by God to the Jew rst and </p>
<p>then to the Gentile (Rom 1:16). All are saved alike, but not all are the same </p>
<p>before being in Christ. Jews had the advantages of God’s self-revelation in </p>
<p>the Law and worship at the temple. Jews were monotheists; Gentiles were </p>
<p>polytheists, pantheists, or panentheists. Paul will expand on this in the </p>
<p>next chapter. Here we should hear Paul’s emphasis that God’s promise in </p>
<p>Christ is for all, Jew and Gentile. e proof, if you will, is in the Spirit. For </p>
<p>the early church, second only to the amazing truth of Christ’s resurrection </p>
<p>was the reality of the Spirit indwelling all believers—including Gentiles. </p>
<p>is is Peter’s great discovery in Acts 10:1—11:18, that God shows no </p>
<p>favoritism, inasmuch as Gentiles, as Gentile believers, receive the Holy </p>
<p>Spirit. So too Paul declares in Eph 1:14 that the Holy Spirit is a seal or </p>
<p>surety of a believer’s inheritance, namely the redemption of those who are </p>
<p>saved in Christ to God’s glory. e Holy Spirit of promise points to the </p>
<p>eschatological future. In 1:3 Paul states believers have been blessed with </p>
<p>every spiritual blessing, and here we nd the Spirit of promise, implying </p>
<p>things to come, and also the seal of the Spirit who is active now. e grand </p>
<p>sweep of God’s loving salvation story as willed and accomplished by the </p>
<p>Father, Christ, and the Holy Spirit—past, present, and future—stretches </p>
<p>our imagination.</p>
<p>Paul’s Prayer (1:15–23)</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in </p>
<p>the Lord Jesus and your love for all his people, </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>I have not </p>
<p>stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my </p>
<p>prayers. </p>
<p>17</p>
<p>I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, </p>
<p>the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and </p>
<p>revelation, so that you may know him better. </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>I pray that the </p>
<p>eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may </p>
<p>know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his </p>
<p>glorious inheritance in his people, </p>
<p>19</p>
<p>and his incomparably </p>
<p>great power for us who believe. at power is the same as the </p>
<p>mighty strength </p>
<p>20</p>
<p>he exerted when he raised Christ from the </p>
<p>dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms, </p>
