<p>Ephesians 4:17–32</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>enjoins those who have put o falsehood to speak truth to their fellow </p>
<p>Christ followers (4:25), which includes resisting anger, slander, and bit-</p>
<p>terness (4:31). James, in his letter, notes as well the power of the tongue </p>
<p>to build up or destroy a community (Jas 3:6–12). Paul also warns strongly </p>
<p>against allowing anger to fester (4:26). Sadly, many of us have been part </p>
<p>of church ghts that pit one group against another. Had the wounds been </p>
<p>exposed to the healing air and cleansed carefully, the body would have </p>
<p>healed in time. Paul is under no illusions that the devil has designs to </p>
<p>weaken Christ’s body, and one avenue of attack is through fomenting an-</p>
<p>ger (4:27). Paul describes a personal situation wherein someone at Corinth </p>
<p>had personally insulted him publicly. He asks that the Corinthians address </p>
<p>rmly the slander, which apparently they did. us he cautions them that </p>
<p>since the person did repent, the rest must receive him back with open </p>
<p>arms and hearts, so that Satan will not gain the upper hand over the com-</p>
<p>munity (2 Cor 4:5–11).</p>
<p>In addition to watching their words closely, Paul suggests that the </p>
<p>Ephesians work at their jobs in order to have enough to aid other mem-</p>
<p>bers of Christ who have needs (4:28). Paul directs thieves to cease stealing, </p>
<p>which may imply that some Ephesians were stealing. In Paul’s day, slaves </p>
<p>might take from their masters, or workers from their employers—the </p>
<p>struggles of life can feel overwhelming and people choose what initially </p>
<p>looks like the easy way out. But Paul charges them to toil at their work, </p>
<p>not that they might get rich, but that they would have enough le over for </p>
<p>those who because of illness or disability might be unable to work. e </p>
<p>temptations to steal things or time from our employers remain strong </p>
<p>today, but what seems quick and painless is really ultimately selsh, for a </p>
<p>stolen good cannot be shared. Paul understands work as something that </p>
<p>benets the entire community, as those with jobs and income can provide </p>
<p>goods, services, and money to those who lack the resources to make a </p>
<p>living themselves. An example of such an attitude is the Macedonians, </p>
<p>as Paul describes in 2 Cor 8:1–5. Paul celebrates these churches (includ-</p>
<p>ing the Philippians, essalonians, and Bereans, for example) and their </p>
<p>example of giving to the Judean churches in need. e Macedonians in </p>
<p>their destitute poverty considered it supreme joy to give beyond what </p>
<p>was thought possible, so that they might be part of God’s activities in </p>
<p>Judea. ey understood that the (little) money they earned was not only </p>
<p>for themselves, but could be used for kingdom purposes, building the </p>
<p>body of Christ across the world. eir eyes were lied beyond their own </p>
