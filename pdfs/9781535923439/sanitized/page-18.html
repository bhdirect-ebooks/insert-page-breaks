<p>fects each community as well as the newly forming church. In Ephesians, </p>
<p>we have both of these convictions represented as two sides of the same </p>
<p>coin. e redemptive work of Christ takes material shape in creating a </p>
<p>new people of God made up of Jews and Gentiles. e new community is </p>
<p>not a serendipitous result of Christ’s resurrection; rather it is the tangible, </p>
<p>everyday proof of God’s surpassing power to make all things new. e </p>
<p>empty tomb evidences Christ’s resurrection, and his appearance to his </p>
<p>disciples and apostles (including Paul, 1 Cor 9:1–2; 15:8) was a testimony </p>
<p>many clung to even in the face of martyrdom. But the ramications of the </p>
<p>resurrection are not limited to the salvation of the human soul, or even to </p>
<p>restoring the kingdom to Israel as the disciples wondered aloud to Jesus </p>
<p>(Acts 1:6). God’s plans are much bigger. ey include the whole creation, </p>
<p>and the evidence of Jew and Gentile together as equal participants in </p>
<p>community is the daily conrmation Paul points to that God is indeed at </p>
<p>work in Christ. e Letter to the Ephesians is a six-chapter exposition on </p>
<p>the mystery of God’s wisdom revealed in this salvation plan.</p>
<p>Ironically, those who reject Pauline authorship of the letter (see a </p>
<p>full discussion below) oen point to the focused attention the church </p>
<p>receives in Ephesians for support of their contentions. But the emphasis </p>
<p>on church is a natural and essential aspect of Christ’s work on the cross, </p>
<p>and so the extensive discussion in Ephesians about the church should </p>
<p>not give rise to suspicions that the letter is deutero-Pauline, that is, at-</p>
<p>tributed to Paul but not written under Paul’s direct inuence. Indeed the </p>
<p>church is a necessary part of God’s redemptive plan, which is to make all </p>
<p>creation new. e church, as the body of Christ (who is its head), is an </p>
<p>instrument through which God works to restore his creation, until the </p>
<p>nal event when God will establish the new heavens and new earth, when </p>
<p>Christ hands over the kingdom to the Father (1 Cor 15:28). e church </p>
<p>as the body of Christ represents (imperfectly) Christ to the world, and as </p>
<p>such it is not a pleasant, though secondary, consequence of God’s work </p>
<p>of redemption. Instead the church signals, by the empowering Spirit, the </p>
<p>gospel to the unbelieving and seeking world. Said another way, the church </p>
is best understood, not as a collection of saved individuals or a group
<p>pledging particular doctrines (Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant), but as a </p>
<p>living organism. By walking in the good works prepared for it by God </p>
<p>(Eph 2:10), the church led by Christ, the head, witnesses to God’s power </p>
<p>and love. Ephesians pushes us toward a healthy vision of the church and </p>
away from a purely individualistic understanding of salvation.
