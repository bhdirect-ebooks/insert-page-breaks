<p>Grace through Faith, Not Works</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>Paul declares that circumcision and uncircumcision count for nothing, </p>
<p>only the new creation matters. e reality of the new creation, then, is </p>
<p>seen against the backdrop of both the Jew/Gentile identity struggle, and </p>
<p>the battle between the present evil age and the age to come, inaugurated </p>
<p>now in Christ.</p>
<p>Good Works</p>
<p>What is the function for which God’s masterpieces have been created? </p>
<p>Paul describes it as “good works,” which have been laid out in advance by </p>
God. Christians from diverse traditions today for various reasons seem to
<p>have an allergic reaction to the phrase “good works.” Heart rates elevate, </p>
<p>palms sweat, and people prepare themselves for an onslaught of guilt feel-</p>
<p>ings. Or perhaps eyes glaze over, minds tune out, and people gure that </p>
<p>the whole works business is for those who don’t really trust God for their </p>
<p>salvation. Both reactions are rooted in a bifurcation of our humanity into </p>
<p>the saved soul and the damned esh. is gnostic view, however, could </p>
<p>not be more inaccurate. As we saw above, salvation is for the total person. </p>
<p>e promise of a resurrected body well suited for life on the new earth </p>
<p>signals that our current life as a member of Christ’s body provides prac-</p>
<p>tice for life in the age to come. I suggest that Paul understands creation as </p>
<p>functional, that Paul cannot imagine a new creation without its attending </p>
<p>purpose. e purpose gives value and makes sense of the created entity. </p>
<p>A new creation without an attending purpose would be like having a golf </p>
<p>ball with no clubs. erefore to see the new believer’s life through a tem-</p>
<p>plate of works for merit versus saved by grace does not capture Paul’s in-</p>
<p>tentions here. e point is new creation, which, like the physical creation, </p>
<p>is designed with a purpose in mind. e creature is equipped to function </p>
<p>as it should by its Creator.</p>
<p>No believer needs to cast about looking for good works, for God </p>
<p>has provided a way for each believer to fulll his or her purpose. What is </p>
<p>intended by Paul’s claim that God has prepared good works “in advance”? </p>
<p>It could imply that before the foundation of the world specic activities </p>
were decided upon and individuals’ names were attached to each. It is also
<p>possible that Paul speaks more generally here of kingdom work which has </p>
<p>been prepared for by Christ’s death and resurrection. Jesus speaks of the </p>
<p>elds being ready for harvest, and needing reapers (Matt 9:37). General </p>
<p>tasks such as caring for widows and orphans (Jas 1:27), bearing each </p>
