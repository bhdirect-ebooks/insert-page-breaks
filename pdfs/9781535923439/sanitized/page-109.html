<p>Paul’s Prayer</p>

<p>Paul’s Prayer (3:16–19)</p>
<p>Verses 3:16–19 follow a particular structure organized around three </p>
<p>clauses, which begin with hina (“that”), three main verbs, and two pairs </p>
<p>of aorist innitives. Paul prays that God will grant certain things to the </p>
<p>Ephesians and that the Ephesians will be strong and be lled. e ow of </p>
<p>his prayer is that God would grant them strength through his Spirit and </p>
<p>that Christ would dwell in them, and that the Ephesians would be strong </p>
<p>both in understanding and in knowing, which can be summed up as be-</p>
<p>ing lled with or into God’s fullness.</p>
<p>e rst section of this prayer (3:16–18) addresses God as the one </p>
<p>who fullls or grants this prayer. Paul establishes that God is able from his </p>
<p>abundant riches to grant these requests; this prayer is not one of despera-</p>
<p>tion wherein the petitioner has little hope of getting a positive response. </p>
<p>Indeed, Paul is condent that because of God’s working through Christ, </p>
<p>his prayer has every chance of success. Paul focuses on asking that the </p>
<p>Ephesians be strengthened in power in their inner person. Paul is not </p>
<p>speaking dualistically here, as though the body counts for nothing, and </p>
<p>all that matters is the soul. e inner person is that which has been made </p>
<p>new, and will receive a resurrected body. e inner person is the new </p>
<p>creature in Christ, the member of Christ’s body, the co-heir with God’s </p>
<p>household. Paul continues that this inner person is the home wherein </p>
<p>Christ dwells by faith. Love has taken root and has established itself in </p>
<p>each believer, making the indwelling of Christ something each believer </p>
<p>can experience.</p>
<p>In 3:16, Paul asks that God act based on the wealth of his glory. Above </p>
<p>in 3:13, Paul notes that his aictions are the glory of the Ephesians; this </p>
<p>glory is tied to the Ephesians being in Christ. In 3:16, Paul uses the term </p>
<p>as that which denes and reects God’s character. God’s glory, his charac-</p>
<p>ter, his truth, is such that he is able to grant Paul’s following requests for </p>
<p>strength through the Spirit and the indwelling of Christ. Paul introduces </p>
<p>with the phrase “strengthen you with power” the theme of power, which </p>
<p>will carry through this prayer and doxology. e term for “power” carries </p>
<p>the sense of ability or capability for action. is powerful strength is made </p>
<p>available through the Spirit to work in the inner person. Paul uses this </p>
<p>phrase “inner being” for several reasons. First, the terms for strength can </p>
<p>be understood in a physical sense, such as being strong for battle. But Paul </p>
<p>is speaking of the strength of character that informs the actions and atti-</p>
