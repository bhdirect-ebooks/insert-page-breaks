<p>he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.</p>
<p>Prolegomena to the Household Codes</p>
<p>I approach the following material as one might when venturing into a mineﬁeld. </p>
<p>Caution is the order of the day, and adequate preparation. Certain questions </p>
<p>should at least be on the table, even if the answers fail to satisfy completely. </p>
<p>In Eph 5:21—6:9, Paul addresses marriage, parenting, and slavery. Today far </p>
<p>more attention is paid to the ﬁrst topic, while 150 years ago concentration </p>
<p>focused on the third pair, slaves and owners. Having a healthy appreciation </p>
<p>for the ancient world’s setting is critical to understanding Paul’s injunctions; </p>
<p>however, it is usually not enough for today’s reader, who recognizes “that was </p>
<p>then, this is now,” at least with respect to slavery. Suggestions follow about </p>
<p>what impact Paul’s injunctions should have for our lives today and issues of </p>
<p>racism and patriarchy ﬂoat into the conversation. As interpreters of the text, </p>
<p>we need to keep an eye both on the historical past and on our own context.</p>
<p>We also need to broaden our approach in several directions. A useful </p>
<p>exercise is pondering why Paul included this section at all. He does not bring </p>
<p>up marriage, family, or slavery in this way in his other letters, except brieﬂy in </p>
<p>Colossians (3:18—4:1). He is not responding to a speciﬁc question as he does </p>
<p>in 1 Cor 7:1–2, where he discusses sexual behavior in marriage (and mentions </p>
<p>slavery brieﬂy, 1 Cor 7:21–23). One way to explore Paul’s reasons for includ-</p>
<p>ing this section is to imagine the letter without it. Picture Paul speaking about </p>
<p>being ﬁlled with the Spirit (5:21), and going straight to putting on the armor </p>
<p>of God (6:10). Would anything be missed? From our vantage point today, given </p>
<p>how these verses have been interpreted to sanction abuses against slaves and </p>
<p>the promotion of slavery, we might wish they had not been penned. However, </p>
<p>for the Ephesians, this section brought their faith down to a livable level. </p>
<p>Recall the grand, liturgical sounding language in chs. 1 and 2 that lauded </p>
<p>God the Father, the Lord Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. The surety of a believer’s </p>
<p>salvation, the certainty of being seated with Christ, and the promise that all </p>
<p>will end well, these are all truths to be treasured. Paul’s burden in chs. 4 </p>
<p>and 5 is to help believers live out their salvation. He begins in the church, </p>
<p>explaining the importance of gifts for building up the community. Next he </p>
