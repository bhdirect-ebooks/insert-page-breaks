<p>who was like an aborted fetus (1 Cor 15:8)—hardly a attering picture. </p>
<p>Others suggest that Paul would not identify apostles as holy (Eph 3:5), as </p>
<p>this was a later, post-apostolic appellation. But Paul is quite complimen-</p>
<p>tary when speaking of apostles as gied by God (1 Cor 12:28). Could the </p>
<p>same writer be both highly critical of Paul, and warmly sympathetic to </p>
<p>the apostles (which included Paul, Eph 1:1)? Another problematic aspect </p>
<p>of 3:1–11 is the apparent assumption by the author that the audience has </p>
<p>not seen Paul, but has heard of him (see 3:1, which notes that they heard </p>
<p>of Paul, implying that they did not know him directly). Presumably if </p>
<p>Paul spent over two years in Ephesus (Acts 19:10), then many in that city </p>
<p>would have known Paul personally. If this is an encyclical letter, however, </p>
<p>then Paul could not assume that he has met with each of the churches </p>
<p>who will hear this letter read in their congregations. A second possibility </p>
<p>is to understand Paul’s remarks as referring narrowly to his current im-</p>
<p>prisonment. If he is writing from Rome, the majority in Ephesus would be </p>
<p>aware of his circumstances but not know them from personal encounter. </p>
<p>Paul’s point, then, in these verses would be to set his current situation in </p>
<p>context: he is a prisoner for the sake of Gentiles (3:1) and rather than that </p>
<p>news dismay or shame them, his suerings are a source of glory for them </p>
<p>(3:13). In sum, the biographical details of chapter 3 need not indicate an </p>
<p>author other than Paul himself.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the results of the internal evidence point to including </p>
<p>Ephesians as one of Paul’s genuine letters, with the admitted distinctive </p>
<p>language and content varying within an acceptable range from the un-</p>
<p>disputed letters. We proceed under the assumption that this letter was </p>
<p>commissioned directly by Paul and was executed under his guidance and </p>
<p>authority.</p>

<p>and the Early Church</p>
<p>Historical Survey of Pseudonymity</p>
<p>Having examined much of the evidence put forward in support of under-</p>
<p>standing Ephesians as deutero-Pauline, a brief exploration of the notion </p>
<p>of pseudonymity (borrowing a well-known author’s name for one’s own </p>
<p>work) in the ancient world merits our attention. Until about 300 years ago, </p>
<p>most readers of the Pauline corpus assumed all letters attributed to Paul </p>
