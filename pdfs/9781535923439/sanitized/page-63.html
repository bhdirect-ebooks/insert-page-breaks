<p>ing of salvation. Christ’s redemption does not simply save our sorry little </p>
<p>souls—it is so much bigger than that puny picture. Life in Christ means </p>
<p>being a member of Christ’s body, being shaped together into the temple </p>
<p>wherein the Holy Spirit dwells, and in the unity of that Spirit accomplish-</p>
<p>ing the work of God prepared by God for his people to do. Both Jews and </p>
<p>Gentiles knew all about temples, these were sacred spaces marked out by </p>
<p>and for the deity. ey were somewhat intimidating places, inasmuch as </p>
<p>the deity was seen to be active there. us all people took great care to be </p>
<p>pure or acceptable before entering the sacred space (obviously this looked </p>
<p>dierent depending on whether you were a Jew or a Gentile). Christians, </p>
<p>unlike the pagans and the Jews, did not have a sacred space, although the </p>
<p>Jerusalem temple continued to be revered by Jewish Christians. Instead </p>
<p>(more about this follows in the next chapter), Paul declares that believers </p>
<p>themselves make up God’s temple. Because that is the case, the ancient </p>
<p>believer would track well with Paul’s claim that, as a stone in God’s tem-</p>
<p>ple, I must be holy in my actions. To do otherwise would desecrate a holy </p>
<p>site—a terrible, unthinkable oense.</p>
<p>At the end of 1:4 we have the clause “in love,” but its referent is de-</p>
<p>bated. Does it modify the previous clause “holy and blameless” or the </p>
<p>following participle “predestined”? Arguments from grammar end in a </p>
<p>draw, and one is le with determining the answer from the context. While </p>
<p>it is without doubt that Paul believes all our actions should be covered </p>
<p>with love, in this specic argument it is not believers who are the primary </p>
<p>focus, but God. Additionally, at the end of 1:6, when Paul wraps up this </p>
<p>particular thought, we nd Paul describing Christ as the Beloved. is </p>
<p>is the only place Paul describes Jesus in these terms (for a similar term, </p>
<p>see Col 1:13), however, the Synoptic Gospels use it in describing Jesus’ </p>
<p>baptism and transguration (Matt 3:17, 17:5; Mark 1:11, 9:7; Luke 3:22; </p>
<p>9:35). It would be in keeping with Paul’s rhetorical ourish that he would </p>
<p>begin and end this thought with a similar term, love. erefore, the bal-</p>
<p>ance of evidence tips in favor of understanding “in love” in connection </p>
<p>with “predestined.” Paul is asserting that God predestined out of his love.</p>
<p>Redemption in Christ (1:7–10)</p>
<p>Paul describes Christ the Beloved as the one in whom believers have re-</p>
<p>demption, specically the forgiveness of transgressions through his shed </p>
<p>blood. Paul does not seek to prove the validity of his statement. ere is </p>
