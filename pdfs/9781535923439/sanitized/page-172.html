<p>Ephesians 6:10–18</p>

<p>A third question remains, namely, whether this armor is to be used </p>
<p>in the present age or at the end of the present age, in our future. e </p>
<p>introductory phrase in 6:10 is oen translated as “nally” but can be un-</p>
<p>derstood as “in the future.” is phrase on its own presents inconclusive </p>
<p>evidence. However, a close examination of the verb tenses suggests that </p>
<p>the armor is for our present use.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Christian Obedience</p>
<p>Paul entreats the Ephesians to put on the full armor that God provides and </p>
<p>stand ﬁrm, resisting the powers of darkness and the spiritual forces of evil. </p>
<p>But one could ask, if the battle has already been won, if all things have been </p>
<p>placed under Christ’s feet (1:22), then why ﬁght at all? Do the personal vic-</p>
<p>tories or those won by the church against these forces of evil matter at all in </p>
<p>the long run? Perhaps the answer is found in 6:18, with Paul’s encouragement </p>
<p>to pray to God at all times for all things and to keep watch. There is some </p>
<p>question as to whether these participles are part of the full armor of God, but </p>
<p>most likely they reﬂect how the armor is to be used. That is, the sword of the </p>
<p>Spirit and the helmet of salvation are taken up through prayer and watchful-</p>
<p>ness. The scene of Christ’s temptation is a likely parallel (Matt 4:1–11; Luke </p>
<p>4:1–13). Jesus fasted and presumably prayed in the wilderness, and after </p>
<p>forty days is confronted by the devil, who challenges him to turn stone into </p>
<p>bread. Jesus stands fast against the onslaught of Satan’s wicked enticements </p>
<p>by speaking truth, the word of God. So too believers are challenged by Paul </p>
<p>to resist and withstand the devil’s cunning lies by standing ﬁrm in the truth </p>
<p>of their salvation and the love of God demonstrated in Christ and through the </p>
<p>Spirit. As Satan departed from Christ when it was clear that no temptation </p>
<p>would overcome him, so too believers have the full armor of God to quench </p>
<p>ﬂaming arrows sent by the forces of evil until the end when Christ disperses </p>
<p>the darkness and all is light.</p>
<p>Paul’s Request for Prayer and Boldness (6:19–20)</p>
<p>Aer encouraging the Ephesians to pray for each other and keep watch, </p>
<p>Paul asks them to pray for him. His request is simple: that he might speak </p>
