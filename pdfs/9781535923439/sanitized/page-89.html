<p>He Is Our Peace</p>

<p>essary only for Gentiles. Rather, Christ’s work is eective for both Jew </p>
<p>and Gentile. Both Jew and Gentile are necessary for us to understand </p>
<p>the full ramications of Christ’s work. For Paul, Christ takes two enti-</p>
<p>ties and makes them one new thing. is happens in nature when an egg </p>
<p>and a sperm meet and create something new. We see it in the descrip-</p>
<p>tion of marriage in Gen 2:24, that a woman and a man come together in </p>
<p>marriage and are then legally and socially a new entity (5:29–32, see also </p>
<p>1 Cor 6:16). We must avoid concluding that Christ acts as a United </p>
<p>Nations negotiator who keeps two countries or factions from ghting. </p>
<p>is scenario assumes a power dierential that manages to keep chaos at </p>
<p>bay. Additionally, the dierence represented in the Jews and Gentiles is </p>
<p>not merely a tribal, ethnic, or a national struggle, but a spiritual struggle </p>
<p>centering on the identity of the people of God. e peace that Christ </p>
<p>brings is not the absence of hostilities, or even the willingness to tolerate </p>
<p>the other. In Christ, there is no “other.”</p>
<p>e term “peace” is complex, having a range of meaning. e con-</p>
<p>text is crucial. In the New Testament it can mean absence of war (Rev 6:4) </p>
<p>or calmness of mind (Col 3:15); or it can identify a characteristic of God, </p>
<p>“God of peace” (Rom 15:33), “peace of Christ” (Col 3:15); or it can name </p>
<p>a fruit of the Spirit (Gal 5:22–23). Paul’s greetings include his wish that his </p>
<p>readers experience the grace and peace of God. Paul explains in Rom 5:1 </p>
<p>that we have peace with God, having been justied through the death and </p>
<p>resurrection of the Lord Jesus (Rom 4:25). Such good news is expressed in </p>
<p>the Gospels as well. Luke records the angels’ song at Jesus’ birth that pro-</p>
<p>claims peace on earth (Luke 2:14). Jesus declared in the Beatitudes that </p>
<p>peacemakers are blessed; they will be called the children of God (Matt </p>
<p>5:9). In John’s Gospel, Jesus pronounces that he brings peace, and that in </p>
<p>him is peace (16:33; 14:27). Again, and not without irony, Peter declares </p>
<p>to Cornelius, a Roman centurion who makes his living as a soldier, that </p>
<p>the gospel is the good news of peace through Jesus Christ which God sent </p>
<p>to his people Israel (Acts 10:36). In Ephesians, “peace” is declared, for </p>
<p>the hostilities between Jew and Gentile have been stilled in Christ—the </p>
two are now one. And this is not only in personal attitude or individual
<p>actions; peace is to be a lived reality as the church gathers in one place to </p>
<p>worship the one Lord. As our peace, Christ makes Gentiles fellow heirs, </p>
<p>fellow citizens with Jews in God’s commonwealth.</p>
<p>One nal note—a question really. Why did not Paul write that Christ </p>
<p>is our salvation? Surely that is what he meant, right? Once again, however, </p>
