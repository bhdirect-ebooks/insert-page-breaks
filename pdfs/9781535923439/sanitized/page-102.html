<p>Gentiles and Jews Together in Christ</p>
<p>Today many think in the binary categories “saved” and “not saved.” </p>
<p>Another binary category oen used today is that of horizontal and vertical </p>
<p>dimensions of salvation, what we call ecclesiology and soteriology, with </p>
<p>the latter taking precedent over the former. Relying on such a lens, how-</p>
<p>ever, for Ephesians can prevent us from appreciating Paul’s claims. Paul </p>
emphasizes the Jew/Gentile division for both historical and theological reasons. Historically, the division was imposed by his circumstances; Jews
<p>worshiped the one true God in Jerusalem, and everyone else was without </p>
<p>God in the world. From Paul’s Jewish perspective this partition represents </p>
a greater social or ethnic divide than existed among the many Gentile
<p>groups (Egyptian, Greek, Persian, etc.). If Christ is able to break down the </p>
<p>heavily fortied social walls between Jew and Gentile, certainly the ethnic </p>
<p>tensions between Greek and Scythian, or Egyptian and Roman, could be </p>
<p>resolved in Christ as well.</p>
But underpinning this historical reality was a deeper theological divi-
<p>sion between the people of God and idolaters. ese opposite groups face </p>
<p>dierent struggles in their coming to God. We saw in 2:1–3 that Gentiles </p>
<p>were without hope and without God, wasting away in their pagan futil-</p>
<p>ity, while Jews were trapped by the esh, the pull of sinful desires which </p>
<p>battle against God’s call to holiness as outlined in his Law. Two points </p>
<p>should be emphasized. First, the distinctions between Jew and Gentile </p>
<p>cannot be reduced to racial tension, although in the ancient world racial </p>
<p>tensions between all sorts of groups, including Jews with others, did are </p>
<p>up in various cities across the Empire. For Paul, however, the theological </p>
<p>distinctions are crucial—the Jews are the people of God based on God’s </p>
<p>covenants and promises and thus are not simply an ethnic group, but they </p>
<p>carry with them the revelation of the true God. We must take care, then, </p>
<p>today when drawing parallels with current ethnic tensions or racial issues. </p>
<p>ese analogies are useful but somewhat limited in that no two other </p>
groups today carry the theological weight of the Jew/Gentile division.Second, our understanding of salvation should not be divided into
<p>vertical and horizontal halves, for in Christ, there is both vertical and </p>
<p>horizontal, or there is nothing. Until Christ, the people of God were iden-</p>
<p>tied based on their relationship to God’s covenants and promises, in-</p>
<p>cluding that of circumcision. In Christ, the Gentile, the idolater, is made </p>
<p>new from the inside out, and is placed in God’s family. So oen we stop </p>
