<p>to change. If we carry this analogy forward to social ethics, we have Paul </p>
<p>suggesting a covering of Christ’s ethics over all social relationships—not </p>
<p>to preserve them, but to change and renew them.</p>
<p>Wives and Husbands Addressed (5:21–33)</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Wives Submit to Husbands (5:22–24)</p>
<p>Verses 5:21–24 focuses on two key terms, “submit” and “head,” upon </p>
<p>which the interpretation of these verses hinge. Turning to the rst term, </p>
<p>“submit,” by now the reader is familiar with the stratied Greco-Roman </p>
<p>culture embraced to a greater or lesser extent by Jews and Gentiles alike. </p>
<p>For example, submitting to authorities was as natural as breathing, and </p>
<p>just as critical for the existence of ordered society. Paul’s language of sub-</p>
<p>mission, therefore, was easily understood in its larger context, because </p>
<p>everyone submitted to someone else, even the Emperor, who submitted </p>
<p>to the gods. Within almost every relationship there was a superordinate </p>
<p>and a subordinate, and examples include patron/client and master/slave. </p>
<p>e ordering implied a valuation, such that the patron, master, and male </p>
<p>was seen as superior. However, the second element of the pair was judged </p>
<p>to be necessary, for without it there was no harmony, no social order. I </p>
<p>should note that a patron or master could be female, and her client or </p>
<p>slave a male, which means that subordination in the ancient world was </p>
<p>not limited to male/female.</p>
<p>A close reading of Paul’s injunctions suggests that he shapes the </p>
<p>common understanding so that believers comprehend their actions as </p>
<p>unto Christ. Although each person is new in Christ, the present relation-</p>
<p>ships that govern social order in the family, namely marriage, parenting, </p>
<p>and slavery, must still be negotiated. In the present age of the Roman </p>
<p>Empire (which is passing away), hierarchy and stratication keep order, </p>
<p>and order is a good thing. Totalitarian government, such as the Roman </p>
<p>Empire, was deemed much better than no government at all, and, ironi-</p>
<p>cally to our way of thinking, democracy was seen as little better than mob </p>
<p>rule (Rom 13:1–7, 1 Pet 2:13–17). Indeed, in one peculiar use of the terms </p>
<p>“order” and “submit,” Paul tells the men and women prophets in Corinth </p>
<p>16. For a general discussion of marriage in the Greco Roman world, see Cohick 2009: </p>
<p>65–131.</p>
