<p>Ephesians 2:11–22</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>No Longer Strangers (2:11–13, 19–22)</p>
<p>Paul addresses the Ephesians directly by asking them to recall their lives </p>
<p>before they heard the gospel message. Certain things were true, includ-</p>
<p>ing that they were without God (2:12), although clearly most of them </p>
<p>would have at that time retorted that they were devoted to their gods. </p>
<p>But from Paul’s (and any Jew’s) perspective, Gentiles in the main did not </p>
<p>forsake idolatry; they lived without recognizing God in their everyday </p>
<p>lives. Again, they were strangers to all that true knowledge of God oered, </p>
<p>including the covenants of the promise, the hope that only God brings; </p>
<p>they were outside the community that bears God’s revelation to the world. </p>
<p>Paul describes it as alienated from the citizenship of Israel (2:12). is </p>
<p>unique phrase is rich with subtle meaning. First, the term “citizenship” </p>
<p>is used elsewhere only in Phil 3:20 (using a cognate term), where Paul </p>
<p>contrasts the believer’s loyalty to God and his promises of a new heav-</p>
<p>ens and earth, not to earthly things which have about them the stench of </p>
<p>death. Paul is hinting at the same truth here, that citizenship within Israel </p>
<p>is membership into God’s family. Second, Paul uses “Israel” in a specic </p>
<p>sense here, focusing on the spiritual Israel, those Jews who know the cov-</p>
enants, the promise and the hope of God. Paul divides Jews into those
<p>who are circumcised in the esh, and those who are circumcised also in </p>
<p>the heart (see Jer 9:26). He reminds the Ephesians that they are called the </p>
<p>uncircumcised, but that this label has been given to them by those who </p>
<p>see things from a eshly perspective, not those who understand that true </p>
<p>circumcision is that which is done to the heart.</p>
<p>But the Gentile Ephesians remain no longer in their former state, </p>
<p>for in Christ they are now close to God, they are now fellow citizens with </p>
<p>the saints, they are full members of God’s family, they are building pieces </p>
<p>of God’s holy temple (2:13, 19–22). Each of these images brings depth to </p>
<p>our understanding of the Christian life. Paul declares that they are no lon-</p>
<p>ger outsiders, but are part of the community of saints. Because he speaks </p>
<p>here of being fellow citizens, it is likely that the term “saints” is parallel </p>
<p>to “Israel” in 2:12. e riches of God’s kingdom life, and fellowship with </p>
<p>those who worship the one true God, are now counted as well to Gentiles </p>
<p>in Christ.</p>
