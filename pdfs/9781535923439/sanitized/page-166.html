<p>Ephesians 6:10–20</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate </p>
<p>of righteousness in place, </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>and with your feet tted with the </p>
<p>readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>In addition </p>
<p>to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can </p>
<p>extinguish all the aming arrows of the evil one. </p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Take the </p>
<p>helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the </p>
<p>word of God. </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with </p>
<p>all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert </p>
<p>and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people. </p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Pray </p>
<p>also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so </p>
<p>that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel, </p>
<p>20</p>
<p>for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may </p>
<p>declare it fearlessly, as I should.</p>
<p>Aer directing attention to key constituents of the ancient household, Paul </p>
<p>returns to focus on the entire community. Each believer is called upon to </p>
<p>put on the full armor of God. With compelling metaphors he describes </p>
<p>the spiritual situation of the present age, and commands believers to take </p>
<p>appropriate actions in the face of this evil. A quick review of Paul’s injunc-</p>
<p>tions for the Christian life shows an emphasis in ch. 4 that Christians </p>
<p>walk in a manner suitable to their calling, which includes growing into </p>
<p>the fullness of Christ. It also involves growing together in community as </p>
<p>each member speaks the truth in love and does not give way to slanderous </p>
<p>speech. In ch. 5, Paul continues to stress that Christians walk in Christ. He </p>
<p>contrasts the darkness that had been the Ephesians’ world with their new </p>
<p>life in Christ walking in light. Being lled with the Holy Spirit includes </p>
<p>an attitude of humble worship and service among believers. Now in ch. 6, </p>
<p>Paul speaks not of walking, but of standing rm.</p>
<p>While this section functions as a nal exclamation point on Paul’s </p>
<p>ethical injunctions to the Ephesians, it also serves to connect conceptually </p>
<p>with the epistle’s opening. God is praised and petitioned in 1:3–23 for that </p>
<p>which believers are to stand fast and preserve. e same line (in Greek) </p>
<p>rings in 1:19 and 6:10—“in his mighty power.” Paul employs a similar </p>
<p>format in Philippians, with 1:3–11 and 4:10–20 forming an inclusio of </p>
<p>the entire letter. Additionally, the armor represents key points of theology </p>
<p>within the letter. Paul emphasizes truth in 1:13; 4:15–25; 5:9; he speaks of </p>
<p>righteousness in 4:24 and 5:9. Christ himself is our peace (2:14–18; see </p>
<p>also 4:3; 6:23; 1:2). Paul speaks of the gospel in 1:13; 3:6; 2:17; 3:8, and </p>
