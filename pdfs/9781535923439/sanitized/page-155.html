<p>Fusing the Horizons: Marriage Then and Now</p>
<p>Given the strains on marriage today, how does the redemptive message of the </p>
<p>gospel build up couples? Marriage is unique among relationships in creating </p>
<p>one ﬂesh from two, thus it provides the best parallel for understanding Christ’s </p>
<p>intimacy with the church. While the fall marred God’s creation, with the com-</p>
<p>ing of Christ, God’s kingdom has been inaugurated. In Christ couples enjoy </p>
the hope of new life individually and as one ﬂesh. God’s story of redemption
<p>includes his promises to make each believer new in Christ, redeemed and no </p>
<p>longer a slave to sin. The new self (Eph 4:24) speaks truthfully, and works </p>
<p>through anger and resentment each day, allowing nothing to fester (4:26–27). </p>
<p>The believer’s speech is redemptive, uplifting, focused on beneﬁting others. </p>
<p>The Christian marriage testiﬁes to the power of God, which makes the two one, </p>
<p>witnessing to God’s reconciling power making the church one with Christ.</p>
<p>Summary of 5:21–33</p>
<p>e analogies used by Paul above, that marriage should resemble the rela-</p>
<p>tionship of Christ and the church, are not bothersome to most Christians. </p>
<p>Additionally, Christians have been encouraged to love and serve each </p>
<p>other, based on Christ’s example. e troubling aspect of the marriage </p>
<p>discussion is Paul’s use of the metaphors “head” and “body” because they </p>
<p>support an asymmetrical relationship between husband and wife (based </p>
<p>on the patriarchal view of male superiority and superordination). While </p>
<p>these two terms reect the traditional viewpoint of the wider culture, Paul </p>
<p>weakens their force by connecting the call for wives’ submission to that </p>
<p>of the wider church’s demand that believers, lled with the Spirit, submit </p>
<p>to each other as reecting their newness in Christ. e traditional view is </p>
<p>further weakened with Paul’s use of “body” and “esh,” for the emphasis is </p>
<p>on the oneness of the married couple, not the dissimilarity between them. </p>
<p>eir very distinctiveness as male and female opens the possibility for </p>
<p>them to become one esh. e husband’s wife is as his own esh, for they </p>
<p>are one esh, which implies that the wife’s husband is as her own esh. </p>
<p>rough this image, Paul has introduced reciprocity in marriage. is </p>
<p>Christian distinctive, grounded in the charges to the rst couple (Gen </p>
