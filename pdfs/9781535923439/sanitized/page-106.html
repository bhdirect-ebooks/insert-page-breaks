<p>Ephesians 3:1–13</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>though Paul speaks of his aictions (plural), he uses a singular pronoun </p>
<p>when he writes that “it [the suerings] is your glory.” Perhaps Paul sees </p>
<p>his apostolic ministry as a single event of suering, as he expresses in 2 </p>
<p>Tim 4:6, “for I am already being poured out as a drink oering.”</p>
<p>Paul connects the honor the Ephesians now enjoy as new creatures </p>
<p>in Christ with his aictions. e term “glory” carries the basic mean-</p>
<p>ing of a “summation of all of one’s attributes and thus one’s reputation </p>
<p>and/or honor.”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Usually “glory” primarily refers to God’s glory (but see 1</p>
<p>Cor 11:7), which invites the question as to why Paul would speak of the </p>
<p>Ephesians’ glory. eir glory is in and for Christ, just as Paul’s suering </p>
<p>is in and for Christ. A similar sentiment is expressed in Rom 8:17–18 </p>
<p>and 2 Cor 4:17. In Rom 8:18, he notes that the suerings experienced by </p>
<p>Christians in the present age will not compare with “the glory that will be </p>
<p>revealed in us.” Such suering identies believers as in Christ, for they are </p>
<p>participating, as did Christ, in suering endemic to this age. As co-heirs </p>
<p>with Christ, they will share in his glory when all is revealed, in the day of </p>
<p>the redemption of their bodies (Rom 8:23). In 2 Cor 4:17 Paul comforts </p>
<p>the Corinthians in the hope that “our light and momentary troubles are </p>
<p>achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.” is eter-</p>
<p>nal glory that is the believer’s own in Christ comes at the cost of Christ’s </p>
<p>death and the church’s suering. For Paul specically, it comes with the </p>
<p>responsibilities of apostleship. Col 1:24–26 reects a similar idea as well. </p>
<p>Here Paul indicates that he rejoices in his suering for the Colossians, </p>
<p>that as Christ’s servant commissioned to preach “the word of God in its </p>
<p>fullness” he presents the mystery of the gospel, which is “Christ in you, </p>
<p>the hope of glory.” In both Colossians and Ephesians, Paul reects on how </p>
<p>his imprisonment and his other aictions have testied to the mystery of </p>
<p>the gospel, that Christ died and was raised for both Jew and Gentile. To </p>
<p>conclude, then, in Eph 3:13 the Gentiles enjoy a share in Christ’s glory </p>
<p>through the gospel, which is preached to them by Paul, who remains a </p>
<p>prisoner because of his calling. e aictions he suers for the sake of </p>
<p>the gospel are evidence of the profound truth that Gentiles are members </p>
<p>of God’s family, and thus share in God’s glory through Christ.</p>
