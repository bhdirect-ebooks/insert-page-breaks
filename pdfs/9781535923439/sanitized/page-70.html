<p>Ephesians 1:15–23</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and </p>
<p>every name that can be invoked, not only in the present age </p>
<p>but also in the one to come. </p>
<p>22</p>
<p>And God placed all things un-</p>
<p>der his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for </p>
<p>the church, </p>
<p>23</p>
<p>which is his body, the fullness of him who lls </p>
<p>everything in every way.</p>
<p>is last section of chapter 1 recounts Paul’s prayer, one rich in theologi-</p>
<p>cal nuance. Several points should be noted, not the least of which is that </p>
<p>this prayer is grounded in the attitude of thanksgiving. e content of his </p>
<p>prayer includes three key components: that the believers would know (1) </p>
<p>the hope of their calling, (2) the wealth of their inheritance, and (3) the </p>
<p>mighty power of God which raised Jesus from the dead. Paul oers this </p>
prayer not for individual believers as though they can fully attain this
<p>on their own, but imagines this prayer being fullled or accomplished in </p>
<p>community. ese are not private goals, in other words, but community </p>
<p>goals, the pursuit of which must happen in the church. I might note here </p>
<p>parenthetically that those who claim Ephesians only imagines the church </p>
<p>universal fail to appreciate that Paul prays God will accomplish his will in </p>
<p>each believer’s life as they experience life in the community of the faithful. </p>
<p>ough it is true that the church universal is Christ’s body, it is equally </p>
<p>true that Paul imagines believers will experience the inheritance of God </p>
<p>in their local community, where their gis are exercised and their good </p>
<p>works are realized by God’s power.</p>
<p>When Paul prays for them, he never fails to thank God for them. </p>
<p>is attitude is based on their faith in Christ and their expressions of love </p>
<p>to the saints. It is too easy to fall into the trap so eloquently observed by </p>
<p>G. K. Chesterton, namely, loving humanity but hating people. Paul does </p>
<p>not simply thank God in some esoteric sense or with supercial aware-</p>
<p>ness of the Ephesians’ situation. He declares that their walk with God </p>
<p>has produced actual results in the form of loving acts on behalf of their </p>
<p>brothers and sisters in the Lord. One is reminded of John’s comments that </p>
<p>people cannot declare their love of God, while at the same time harboring </p>
<p>deep resentment or anger towards God’s children. Paul is proud of the </p>
<p>Ephesians, he is happy that they have demonstrated a working faith, a </p>
<p>sincere commitment to the community of faith. Indeed, these words of </p>
<p>thanks are not idle or shallow, but based on actual postures of obedience </p>
