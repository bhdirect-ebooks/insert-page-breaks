<p>Children and Parents Addressed (6:1–4)</p>
<p>e second twosome of the household codes seems unproblematic on </p>
<p>rst read, and compared with the other two pairs, its interpretation is less </p>
<p>contentious. However, the force of the injunction is muted in our Western </p>
<p>culture, probably in part because we value youth and innovation while </p>
<p>labeling the older members of society as behind the times and even a </p>
<p>burden on the society. My years in Kenya showed me another way entirely </p>
<p>to understand the obedience of children to parents and the attitudes un-</p>
<p>derpinning the call to honor parents. e African culture is instructive in </p>
<p>that it mirrors Paul’s environment in many respects. Contemporary Asian </p>
<p>cultures as well have a much higher regard for honoring parents, and they </p>
<p>come to our text with a better appreciation for Paul’s injunctions.</p>
<p>Paul instructs children to obey their parents. e verb’s present tense </p>
<p>is in the command form, suggesting that this is a posture children should </p>
<p>take because God commanded it. Obviously, Paul is not advocating that a </p>
<p>child obey a parent who asks them to sin, nor is Paul suggesting that the </p>
<p>child have no dreams or aspirations of their own. Rather, the child is en-</p>
<p>joined to respect his or her parents as they model the wisdom and grace of </p>
<p>God that they experienced in their lives. Paul quotes from the Decalogue </p>
<p>(using the Greek translation, Exod 20:12; Deut 5:16). No person, Jew </p>
<p>or Gentile, would dispute Paul’s claims that children should honor and </p>
<p>obey their parents. So why does he add that the commandment includes </p>
<p>a promise of blessing for obedient children? Most likely Paul adds the </p>
<p>promise because this phrase is in the biblical text. God’s command for </p>
<p>children to honor parents is sweetened with his promise to honor the </p>
<p>obedient ones with long life. As the child grows to adulthood, they remain </p>
<p>the progeny of their parents, and as such, they continue to obey and honor </p>
<p>them, although the specic deeds of obedience might look dierent. And </p>
<p>each culture negotiates the level of involvement expected by parents. In </p>
<p>some settings, parents choose their children’s spouses, and have extensive </p>
<p>inuence over where their children live and what occupations they take </p>
<p>up. In the West such involvement is generally not reinforced by the wider </p>
culture, but perhaps some modication from our individualism might be
<p>helpful. In this endeavor, our sisters and brothers in Africa and the East </p>
<p>can be important resources.</p>
<p>While the command to obey includes both parents, the charge to re-</p>
<p>frain from exasperating children is addressed to the fathers. It is possible </p>
