<p>Prolegomena to the Household Codes</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>The Ancient Society</p>
<p>Two key concepts of ancient society must be understood when interpreting </p>
<p>the household codes. The ﬁrst is the honor/shame culture. To use a computer </p>
<p>analogy, this would be the hardware; honor/shame categories control the pos-</p>
<p>sibilities within the system. The various programs running on the computer </p>
<p>can be likened to the hierarchical society whose organization was based on </p>
<p>status, reciprocity, and benefaction. Additionally, the political realm was root-</p>
<p>ed organically in the household structure. These forces together meant that </p>
<p>the highest goal for any person was to achieve honor, and the path to honor </p>
<p>lay in submitting to authority or those of higher status. Shame was the lot of </p>
those who sought an individual road, or who failed to praise their benefactor,
<p>or who stepped outside the socially drawn lines of conduct for their station in </p>
<p>life. Each of these aspects of ancient culture must be appreciated to better </p>
<p>interpret Paul’s injunctions to the Ephesians.</p>
<p>Honor/Shame Culture</p>
<p>Looking ﬁrst at the honor/shame culture,</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>this approach to human interaction</p>
<p>focuses on group values, which are determined and enforced by the com-</p>
<p>munity. Honorable behaviors are those that further the community’s goals; </p>
<p>disgraceful deeds are those that put the community at risk. In Paul’s world, </p>
people did not make sense of themselves as individuals but as members of
<p>a larger group. One’s identity was embedded in the family or the city. For </p>
<p>example, a female’s identity and honor was rooted in a male’s honor, and a </p>
<p>child’s honor was embedded in their father or mother’s honor. In the West we </p>
<p>tend to internalize our norms and focus on what is right and wrong; we do not </p>
seek the explicit approval of the larger group. We encourage individualism
<p>and risk-taking for personal gain. We value difference and independence. Yet </p>
<p>in the military and in sporting competitions we ﬁnd something of the honor/</p>
<p>shame culture today. Athletes representing their countries in the modern </p>
<p>Olympic games are rewarded by their fellow countrymen not with monetary </p>
<p>gain, but with social honor and respect. We feel ashamed of those who act </p>
<p>cowardly or those who during the sporting event do not give their all for the </p>
<p>team’s victory.</p>
<p>9. For a useful explanation of the honor/shame culture as it impacts the New </p>
<p>Testament, see DeSilva 2000.</p>
