<p>then one might comfortably assume Paul used the same scribe, and might </p>
<p>have wished to stress similar ideas to churches in the same general re-</p>
<p>gion. Moreover, it seems ironic to declare that Ephesians is not by Paul </p>
<p>because it uses language found in other Pauline material. Why assume a </p>
<p>second author instead of asserting that the same author reused much of </p>
<p>his material to address a similar circumstance? What is really at stake is </p>
<p>not the vocabulary per se, but the alleged meaning of those terms. For that </p>
<p>we turn in the next section to the theological arguments against Pauline </p>
<p>authorship. In summary, the literary analysis does not show conclusively </p>
<p>that Paul could not have written the epistle. Indeed, the evidence points </p>
<p>to Pauline authorship inasmuch as it highlights the creativity of Paul to </p>
<p>tailor his language to the audience and occasion. e number of hapax le-</p>
<p>gomena or unique occurrences of terms in Ephesians are no more than we </p>
<p>nd in the undisputed letter to the Galatians, for example. Two options </p>
<p>are le to consider: either Paul wrote the epistle which varied from his </p>
<p>other letters by about 5 percent, or someone was able to match Paul’s writ-</p>
<p>ing by 95 percent. ese percentages suggest that Paul wrote Ephesians, </p>
<p>but it is not on literary analysis alone that most render their judgments </p>
<p>concerning Paul’s authorship.</p>
<p>eological Emphases in Ephesians</p>
<p>More troubling for many who argue a pseudepigraphic status for </p>
<p>Ephesians are the theological and ideological statements permeating the </p>
<p>letter that seem at odds with Pauline thought. For example, it is oen said </p>
<p>that Ephesians assumes a realized eschatology, with salvation having been </p>
<p>accomplished fully in the past with no future implications (2:8–9). For </p>
<p>example, Paul uses the perfect tense when speaking about believers being </p>
<p>saved, rather than talking about the hope which looks forward. e cross </p>
<p>is not emphasized, nor is justication; instead the exaltation of Christ </p>
<p>and his cosmic superiority over all powers take center stage. Again, the </p>
<p>emphasis on the church universal rather than the local body strikes many </p>
<p>as deutero-Pauline. A closer look at the theology in Ephesians, however, </p>
<p>suggests close connections with theology expressed in the undisputed </p>
<p>letters. For example, although the term “cross” is found only once (2:16), </p>
<p>this reference forms the platform upon which is built the arguments for </p>
<p>reconciliation of humanity to God and between human groups (Jews and </p>
<p>Gentiles). A similar case is made in 2 Cor 5:18–21 concerning reconcilia-</p>
