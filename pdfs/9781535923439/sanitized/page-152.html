<p>Ephesians 5:21–33</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>use of Christ as head is in 4:15–16, where Paul’s burden is describing </p>
<p>the growth and maturity of the church, Christ’s body. Note the organic </p>
<p>connection between the head and the body, as well as the emphasis on </p>
<p>wisdom, unity, and love. In 5:22–24, Christ as head is explained in part </p>
<p>as Christ the Savior, a quality that is not characteristic of husbands. ree </p>
<p>reasons might have prompted Paul to use the “head” and “body” meta-</p>
<p>phors. First, he is still thinking of life in the Spirit (5:18), and the image </p>
<p>of the church as Christ’s body comes naturally to mind. Second, he is </p>
<p>preparing the way for his argument about husbands and wives being one </p>
<p>body in 5:28–31. Finally, using “head” and “body” allows Paul to cre-</p>
<p>ate a dynamic metaphor that further explains the all-embracing union of </p>
<p>Christ and his church.</p>
<p>What is Paul implying with these metaphors?</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Some argue that the</p>
<p>language of “head” implies that the husband is the source of goodness </p>
<p>and help for his wife. e term “Savior” used to describe Christ is under-</p>
<p>stood to reect the husband’s role as protector for the wife, who did not </p>
<p>have at that time the legal and social protections of a man. Others suggest </p>
<p>that “head” means leader, indicating that Paul’s focus is on the natural </p>
<p>hierarchy between male and female which is expressed in the marriage </p>
<p>relationship. e hierarchical scheme assumed with the use of the parti-</p>
<p>ciple “submit” suggests that Paul’s interest is focused sharply on the idea </p>
<p>of respect and honor due to the one who is superordinate. Paul ends the </p>
<p>discourse on wives and husbands with a call for the wife to respect (fear) </p>
<p>her husband (5:33), which is the expected attitude or posture of one who </p>
<p>submits. Paul’s language should not conjure up a military image of a </p>
<p>commander over his troops, giving orders for the enlisted to follow. His </p>
<p>point is that wives must honor their husbands, and to honor someone is </p>
<p>to submit to them.</p>
<p>One nal point should be noted. Very few ancient writers use the </p>
<p>term “submit” when describing the role of the wife, although the concept </p>
<p>of submission was widespread. us the supercial sense of Paul’s in-</p>
<p>junction, that wives owe their husbands submission, would have seemed </p>
<p>self-evident to his readers. However, Paul’s specic vocabulary (using </p>
<p>the participle from 5:21, restricting “head” as only limitedly similar to </p>
<p>Christ’s position as head, and using the qualier “as to the Lord”) all serve </p>
<p>to nuance his position in ways he develops further in his argument.</p>
<p>18. For a similar discussion from 1 Cor 11:3, see ibid., 94.</p>
