<p>EphEsians 6</p>
<p>is chapter includes a continuation of the household codes as well as a </p>
<p>nal call to the saints to stand fast, ready in the face of an expected assault </p>
by the evil that characterizes the present age. e chapter divisions do
<p>a disservice to the ow of Paul’s thought on the household by separat-</p>
<p>ing his comments on marriage in chapter 5 from his remarks to parents/</p>
<p>children and slaves/masters in chapter 6. e arrangement does serve to </p>
<p>stress, however, the connection between our daily home lives with the </p>
<p>wider reality of spiritual activity present in our midst. Aer concluding </p>
<p>our discussion of the household codes, we will explore in more depth the </p>
<p>call to take up the armor of God.</p>
<p>Household Codes Continued (6:1–9)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>“Honor your father and mother”—which is the rst com-</p>
<p>mandment with a promise—</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>“so that it may go well with you </p>
<p>and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.” </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Fathers, do not </p>
<p>exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the train-</p>
<p>ing and instruction of the Lord. </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Slaves, obey your earthly </p>
<p>masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just </p>
<p>as you would obey Christ. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Obey them not only to win their </p>
<p>favor when their eye is on you, but as slaves of Christ, doing </p>
<p>the will of God from your heart. </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Serve wholeheartedly, as if </p>
<p>you were serving the Lord, not people, </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>because you know </p>
<p>that the Lord will reward each one of you for whatever good </p>
<p>you do, whether you are slave or free. </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>And masters, treat </p>
<p>your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you </p>
<p>know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, </p>
<p>and there is no favoritism with him.</p>
