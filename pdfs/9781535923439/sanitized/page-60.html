<p>Spirit. Moreover, the general topic and mood is similar: God has chosen </p>
<p>and redeemed a people to himself in Christ, and this claim is assured </p>
<p>through the Spirit of God. Paul speaks of our sonship in Christ (8:15, 23 </p>
<p>[perhaps]; Gal 4:5).</p>
<p>It is important to keep this picture of the gracious God central, as </p>
<p>some of the discussion surrounding terms such as “predestine” can give </p>
<p>rise to images of capriciousness or cavalier ippancy in a modern reader’s </p>
<p>mind. Either God is presented as ckle, choosing willy-nilly whomever </p>
<p>he wants and also choosing to damn the rest, or God is seen as choosing </p>
<p>some because in some way, however hidden it may be, they deserved it </p>
<p>more than the others. Of course we usually don’t voice either of these </p>
<p>claims in quite such bald language, but nonetheless their unsettling pres-</p>
<p>ence, like ants at a picnic, intrudes inconveniently.</p>
<p>At issue are two points. First is the relative freedom for humans to </p>
<p>respond to God’s call, especially at the time of salvation. Second, what </p>
<p>is Paul focused upon—initial entrance into God’s family, or the ultimate </p>
<p>end result of salvation? Said another way, is Paul talking about how one is </p>
<p>saved, or to what purpose one is saved? e key point is whether in using </p>
<p>the term “predestined” Paul intends to speak about election, hence about </p>
<p>getting saved, or about the nal redemption, the result of salvation, not </p>
<p>the beginning of it. If used in the latter sense, the term predestined does </p>
<p>not reference election per se but outcome; the one called will end up a </p>
<p>certain way, namely looking like Jesus, being counted as a co-heir. And </p>
<p>of course both these issues are inextricably intertwined with a full-orbed </p>
<p>view of salvation, including redemption, the Christian life, and the new </p>
<p>heavens and new earth. Denominational battle lines have been drawn </p>
<p>over the nuances of this argument, and this quick study of a few of the </p>
<p>pertinent verses will certainly not settle the problem. Laying out the issue </p>
<p>may help readers process the concern and t the puzzle pieces together </p>
<p>as they think best.</p>
<p>In our Ephesians text, we nd Paul connecting the nite verb “he </p>
<p>chose” with the participle “having predestined.” Paul uses the term “pre-</p>
<p>destined” in 1:5, 11 and elsewhere in Rom 8:29, 30 (the verb is also used </p>
<p>in Acts 4:28 and 1 Cor 2:7, referring to objects, not humans). In general, </p>
<p>two schools of thought surface concerning the term’s interpretation. One </p>
<p>school promotes the interpretation that God is choosing some people </p>
<p>(and not others, by implication at least) for salvation. A second school </p>
<p>argues that God calls to all, and some respond; the latter then receive </p>
