<p>Prolegomena to the Household Codes</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>contrasts the Gentile way of life, the life of debauchery, idolatry, greed, and </p>
<p>selﬁshness witnessed in the marketplace and the temples, with the godly life </p>
<p>in the Spirit. But we all know that the rubber meets the road in the family, and </p>
<p>so to be thorough, Paul must explain what life in the Spirit looks like within </p>
<p>the household. But by seeing the household codes as private ethics, we gain </p>
<p>only half the historical picture. The household in the ancient world was the </p>
<p>center of city life, and intimately connected, politically and economically, on </p>
<p>an actual and theoretical level with the city.</p>
<p>Because the household was a central piece of political discussions, a </p>
<p>second issue emerges, namely, whether Paul hopes believers will blend in and </p>
<p>not give offense in their roles as spouses, family members, and slaves/owners </p>
<p>or whether he is promoting another vision of the household. An analogous </p>
<p>question animates studies of 1 Peter. This epistle has a similarly lengthy </p>
<p>discussion about the household that encourages all to submit to the emperor, </p>
<p>who was known as the Father of the Empire, and for slaves to submit to their </p>
<p>masters, and wives to their husbands (1 Pet 2:13—3:7). Some suggest that </p>
<p>Peter hoped to secure acceptance of the gospel through conforming to or </p>
<p>linking with the wider cultural structures. Others argue that Peter challenged </p>
<p>his readers to stand against the temptation to assimilate. When we ask the </p>
<p>same questions of Ephesians, I suggest that we ﬁnd Paul concerned that </p>
<p>the Ephesians not assimilate or mimic the surrounding culture, but rather </p>
<p>implicitly critique it by living out the demands of the gospel. He conﬁgures </p>
<p>the argument to make obvious that a Spirit-ﬁlled life is not bound to the social </p>
<p>constructions established in this present age.</p>
<p>Exploration into why Paul addresses the household also opens up the </p>
<p>opportunity to examine the theology in this section. Paul’s emphasis in this </p>
<p>letter has been Christ and the church, or said another way, on soteriology, </p>
<p>Christology, and ecclesiology. His speciﬁc burden has been explaining the </p>
<p>penultimate chapter in God’s redemptive story wherein through Christ God has </p>
<p>made a people for himself from both Jews and Gentiles. The unity of the two </p>
<p>stands as a witness to God’s greatness and salviﬁc power. A similar emphasis </p>
<p>on unity (of husband and wife) permeates the household codes. Although </p>
<p>today we might read Paul’s statement about Christ being the head of the </p>
<p>church and its Savior as a convenient illustration of marriage, it is more likely </p>
<p>that a particular aspect of marriage (the unique union of two becoming one) </p>
<p>served to elicit yet another image of Christ’s work and person for the earliest </p>
<p>believers.</p>
