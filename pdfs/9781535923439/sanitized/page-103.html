<p>Gentiles and Jews Together in Christ</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>at the rst clause—the idolater was made new—and downplay or even </p>
<p>ignore the second half—they are part of God’s household. But Paul does </p>
<p>not separate them. Salvation, for Paul, is not understandable outside one’s </p>
changed status as a member of God’s people. Breaking down the divid-
<p>ing wall between Jew and Gentile and making the two one signals the </p>
<p>ultimate destruction of the principalities and powers. In this unity, the </p>
<p>church stands against the powers of this age. is means that ecclesiology </p>
<p>is not a secondary matter, but central to the proclamation of God’s victory </p>
<p>over sin and the grave. God’s plan was not merely to save souls—that is </p>
<p>the Gnostic and the Stoic hope which downplayed the physical world. </p>
Nor was God’s plan merely to save individuals—that is the trap many
<p>contemporary Evangelicals fall into. Rather God’s plan, as outlined by </p>
<p>Paul in Ephesians, is to establish a new body, to make a new people, to </p>
<p>build a new temple or dwelling place made up of believers both locally </p>
<p>and across the world. e corporate body of Christ image loses its power </p>
when we think of salvation in individualistic terms. Perhaps nowhere is
<p>this clearer than in 3:10, where Paul declares that the church is God’s </p>
<p>vehicle in broadcasting his wisdom to the powers and principalities.</p>
<p>e ramications of this claim are astounding; three deserve men-</p>
<p>tion. First, it gives a central role to the Holy Spirit, who empowers the new </p>
<p>community. With Christ’s resurrection comes the Spirit, so that believers </p>
<p>are not le orphans (John 14:15–18) but have the seal of God upon them, </p>
<p>assuring them of the gospel truth (Eph 1:13–14). While few would openly </p>
<p>state that the Holy Spirit is the least important Person of the Trinity, it </p>
<p>happens that the work of the Spirit in making daily life within the church </p>
<p>possible is oen overlooked. But Paul stresses that believers together are </p>
<p>God’s dwelling place, a temple “in which God lives by his Spirit” (2:22). It </p>
<p>is the presence of the Spirit presupposed in 3:10 that is seen by the rulers </p>
<p>and authorities in the heavens. A similar claim is made in 1 Cor 3:10–17, </p>
<p>which explains that each community of believers is blessed with the pres-</p>
<p>ence of the Spirit. God signies victory over sin and death by means of </p>
<p>a new community of the faithful, a community led by the Spirit—who </p>
<p>signals to the powers and principalities their ultimate demise. In Eph </p>
<p>3:6–11, the mystery of Christ is that his people, though not ethnically </p>
<p>similar, are all children of the promise, sealed by the Spirit. When the </p>
<p>powers and principalities see this, they realize their days are numbered </p>
<p>(more on the powers in ch. 6).</p>
