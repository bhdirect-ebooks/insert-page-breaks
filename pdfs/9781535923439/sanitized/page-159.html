<p>Children and Parents Addressed</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>that mothers are assumed here. However, since a mother’s authority is </p>
<p>generally limited by a male family member, it may be that they had fewer </p>
<p>opportunities to frustrate a child. Paul enjoins fathers to train their chil-</p>
<p>dren in the Lord. It is a truism that more men than women had education </p>
<p>at this time; however, mothers were also praised for educating or oversee-</p>
<p>ing the education of their sons. Paul is not implying that mothers should </p>
<p>not teach their children, rather that fathers should be actively involved. </p>
<p>Jewish and Roman authors agreed in praising fathers who took a hand </p>
<p>in training or supervising their children’s education. Education looked </p>
<p>very dierent depending on one’s status and nances. Wealthy families </p>
<p>educated both sons and daughters. For example, we know that male phi-</p>
<p>losophers trained their sons and daughters in their cra. Poorer fami-</p>
<p>lies would train their children in the family business, for most children </p>
<p>continued the work of their parents. Also, an owner raising a foundling </p>
<p>might send him o to learn a trade such as weaving. I mention the lat-</p>
<p>ter example because households might include the parents’ children and </p>
<p>slave children. Oen they were raised together, at least in the early years, </p>
<p>for the slave children were the owner’s property and were worth taking </p>
<p>care of and educating.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Infanticide and Abortion</p>
<p>Amidst the similarities between a Jewish and Gentile family there is one glar-</p>
<p>ing difference: the practice of infanticide. Jews (and later Christians) spoke </p>
<p>with one voice against the practice of exposing newborn children as tanta-</p>
<p>mount to murder. The wider Roman world defended the practice as reasonable </p>
<p>and logical. Perhaps an evil omen occurred at birth, warning the father not to </p>
<p>raise the child, or perhaps the child’s legitimacy was in question. Other writ-</p>
<p>ers complained that some fathers were too lazy or greedy to raise more than </p>
<p>one or two children, and so destroyed subsequent infants.</p>

<p>infants, both male and female, were left to the elements outside the town, or </p>
<p>were drowned.</p>

<p>The poor might expose their infants because they lacked the</p>
<p>money to educate them, and a life with no education is one without any virtue, </p>
