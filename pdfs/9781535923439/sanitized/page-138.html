<p>Ephesians 5:7–16</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>Paul begins 5:7 with “therefore,” which signals he has concluded his </p>
<p>previous thought and is now drawing conclusions. He commands that </p>
<p>they not become actively engaged with those who are disobedient (5:6), </p>
<p>for that way is darkness. Paul does not say that the Gentiles are in dark-</p>
<p>ness, but that such an existence is darkness. e Ephesians should know, </p>
<p>Paul reminds them, because this is the life they once led. Perhaps Paul </p>
<p>is calling to mind the ninth plague meted out to the Egyptians (Exod </p>
<p>10:21–24). is judgment was a darkness that could be felt, so dark that </p>
<p>people could not see each other and had to remain in their homes for </p>
<p>three days. is tangible darkness, so thick it had substance, is the thun-</p>
<p>dercloud that encompassed the idolater. Such darkness, however, is not </p>
<p>the last word. e Ephesians are now light. Again, they are not in light, </p>
<p>but are light. eir very substance shines forth the truth of the gospel. </p>
<p>is light is truth, holiness, integrity, and love. is light is the life of Jesus </p>
<p>Christ, who declares “I am the light of the world” (John 8:12, see also 9:5, </p>
<p>12:35, 46). Paul makes a similar call to the Corinthians in 2 Cor 6:14, </p>
<p>16 when he asks, “what fellowship can light have with darkness?” and </p>
<p>further explains his point so that there is no confusion: “what agreement </p>
<p>is there between the temple of God and idols?” A similar point is made </p>
<p>here: the Ephesians are the light, the witness of the gospel’s reconciling </p>
<p>power to a world darkened by sin.</p>
<p>A life of light produces rich fruit, all manner of goodness, righteous-</p>
<p>ness, and truth. Paul uses the metaphor of fruit to describe deeds as well </p>
<p>in Rom 6:21–22. To the Romans Paul contrasts the fruit (TNIV: “benet”) </p>
<p>that is reaped from sin with that produce harvested from acts of righ-</p>
<p>teousness. Fruit is the product of the natural growing cycle. An apple </p>
<p>tree will produce apples, not peaches. A g tree will produce gs, not </p>
<p>pineapples. And a believer who is light will produce that which character-</p>
<p>izes Christ’s life of love and kindness, charity and integrity. But works of </p>
<p>darkness, Paul warns, are unfruitful (Eph 5:11).</p>
<p>Paul commands them not to participate in such dark works, but </p>
<p>rather he urges them to expose such behavior (5:11, 13). is section has </p>
<p>been understood in two general ways. One interpretation sees Paul man-</p>
<p>dating believers to expose by direct, verbal confrontation other believ-</p>
<p>ers’ sinful behaviors, and thus bring them to repentance.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>A second view</p>
<p>4. A possible parallel example is 2 Cor 2:5–8. Paul indicates that believers exposed </p>
<p>the wrong deed of one of their own, who subsequently repented. Paul encourages the </p>
Corinthians to receive back into fellowship the penitent individual.
