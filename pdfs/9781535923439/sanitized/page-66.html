<p>Fusing the Horizons: God’s Plan, Uniting All ings in Christ</p>

<p>creation. Believers have the right and responsibility to stand fast against the </p>
human injustices that wreak havoc on so many individuals and communities,
<p>and also to stand ﬁrm against the spiritual forces at work behind the scenes </p>
<p>fomenting injustice, disobedience to God, and just plain evil (Eph 6:12). As </p>
<p>the church lives out the resurrection truth, not only will bullies and crooks </p>
<p>seek to push the church back into its building with instructions to pay atten-</p>
<p>tion to its own business (understood as saving souls), but the church will also </p>
<p>face spiritual forces that rail against God’s goodness and grace extended to his </p>
<p>earthly creation. In the former case, Paul calls on believers to live out of their </p>
<p>new self and be holy, imitate God (5:1). In the latter case, Paul declares that </p>
<p>the church’s very existence challenges the powers and principalities (3:10), </p>
<p>and so the church must stand ﬁrm in God’s armor against the onslaught of </p>
<p>evil’s ﬁnal frantic bid for power (6:13).</p>
<p>Sealed with the Spirit (1:11–14)</p>
<p>Paul discusses in closer detail the redemptive act of God in Christ, and </p>
<p>more fully discusses the Christian’s gain in Christ. Specically, in Christ </p>
<p>believers are part of the predestined plan of God to bring him praise </p>
<p>through Christ. Paul describes believers as “we” and “you,” distinguish-</p>
<p>ing those who rst were in Christ and those who became members of </p>
the family later. is division is more sharply dened in the following
<p>chapter in terms of Jew and Gentile, and here, although the terms are </p>
<p>not used, it seems likely that at least a key distinguishing characteristic </p>
<p>of the two groups is their Jewish or non-Jewish status. e third Person </p>
<p>of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit, is spotlighted as the believer’s seal of assur-</p>
<p>ance for redemption, looking ahead to the eschatological age. Once again </p>
<p>we nd Paul using the terms “predestined” and “appointed” (sometimes </p>
<p>translated as “made” or “obtain an inheritance”). e latter verb (aorist </p>
<p>passive) is found only here in the New Testament. In the wider Greek </p>
<p>world the verb is connected with casting lots to appoint a position (as </p>
<p>the disciples do in Acts 1:26) and by extension, inheritance. e passive </p>
<p>voice can support the interpretation that God has made believers his in-</p>
<p>heritance. And this would t with the upcoming claim that God’s plan is </p>
<p>to make a people that are to the praise of his glory (1:12). But the verb </p>
<p>can also be interpreted as believers being appointed an inheritance by </p>
