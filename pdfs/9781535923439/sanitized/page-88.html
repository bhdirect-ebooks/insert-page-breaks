<p>Fusing the Horizons: Citizenship</p>

<p>slavery. It is this last option that I think might resonate with Paul’s metaphori-</p>
<p>cal use of citizenship and slavery in his writings. Paul notes that believers are </p>
<p>free—free from the deathly grip of sin, free from the power of the ﬂesh, free </p>
<p>from the constraints and restrictions of the law. Like a manumitted slave, </p>
<p>believers now enjoy the privileges of citizenship.</p>
<p>We do not know how many of the Ephesian and Philippian Christians </p>
<p>were citizens of their cities or of Rome. Philippi was a Roman colony, and </p>
<p>many veterans with their Roman citizenship settled there. Whether these men </p>
<p>or their families were Christian is unclear, but probably unlikely. Thus, for be-</p>
<p>lievers to be part of God’s commonwealth, a citizen of an eternal kingdom, was </p>
<p>good news indeed. It should be good news as well today, and the church has </p>
<p>a special contribution to make in the conversation of citizenship. Concerning </p>
<p>immigration and illegal aliens, the church has an opportunity to develop these </p>
<p>hot-button issues beyond the contexts of (alleged) increased crime or jobs </p>
<p>lost to citizens. We can critique earthly citizenship when it privileges one </p>
<p>group over another, and we can celebrate with believers from around the globe </p>
<p>a single citizenship in the commonwealth of God’s kingdom. Paul used his </p>
<p>Roman citizenship to advance the gospel, not to further his own rights. As he </p>
<p>notes in his letter to the Ephesians, he is chained to a Roman soldier (3:1; </p>
<p>4:1; 6:20); with a single word denying Christ, Paul would be a free man </p>
<p>with all the privileges and honor that his Roman citizenship carries. Instead, </p>
<p>he sees his Roman citizenship as an opportunity to introduce Jesus and his </p>
<p>eternal citizenship to as many people as would listen. He held his Roman </p>
<p>citizenship lightly because he knew it was of the present age which is passing </p>
<p>away. He clung to his citizenship in heaven, knowing it would outlast time.</p>
<p>In celebrating the new life in Christ, Paul draws on Isaiah’s promise (Isa </p>
<p>57:19), which pictures God’s peace extended to the lowly and contrite, </p>
<p>whether near or far. Isaiah warns, however, that the wicked will have no </p>
<p>peace. It is perhaps no accident that aer declaring that those far o have </p>
<p>been brought near through Christ’s blood (see also 1:7), Paul’s next state-</p>
<p>ment is that Christ is our peace.</p>
<p>He Is Our Peace (2:14–18)</p>
<p>What does it mean that Christ is our peace? Note that Paul does not say </p>
<p>that Christ is “your” peace, as though Christ’s work is sucient or nec-</p>
