<p>Fusing the Horizons: Election, Predestination, and Free Will</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>But Paul’s vision of the new age to come is rooted ﬁrmly on the renewed </p>
<p>terra ﬁrma. Our salvation will be lived out in a resurrected body on a renewed </p>
<p>earth. Any discussion of free will and election should have a robust vision of </p>
<p>the totality of God’s salvation “package.” Finally, I confess that I enjoy Paul’s </p>
<p>agility to move between absolute conviction in God’s unstoppable plan, deter-</p>
<p>mined by his will and pleasure alone, and humankind’s accountability, based </p>
<p>on choice, to be responsible for their actions as they relate to God’s plan of </p>
<p>salvation. It is a posture worth emulating, for it promotes humility as believers </p>
<p>search the deep truth of God.</p>
<p>A further point bears pondering. Often in the debate about God’s sover-</p>
<p>eignty and human free will, Western white readers struggle with and are suspi-</p>
<p>cious of the ramiﬁcations of God’s absolute power. In Western democracies, </p>
<p>citizens have grown accustomed to using their voice at the ballot box to effect </p>
<p>change or keep the status quo. However, the earliest believers for the most </p>
<p>part were poor, often marginalized, even slaves. Few had citizenship (either </p>
<p>Roman or within their city). Few were wealthy, and many were persecuted. </p>
<p>Given this backdrop, the promise of a God who has authority over all powers </p>
<p>and authorities—and even more that this God has chosen them—reorients </p>
<p>their understanding of reality. Though for the moment they might be beaten or </p>
<p>denied justice or languish from lack of food or medical care (such as it was), </p>
<p>in the reality that really matters, they were chosen by the God of the universe. </p>
<p>A modern example might help. I lived in Kenya for three years as an American </p>
<p>citizen abroad. If trouble occurred or if natural disaster were to strike, I could </p>
<p>escape the consequences by using my U.S. passport backed by the strength </p>
<p>and reputation of the United States government. So too, Paul declares that </p>
<p>both the earliest Christians and believers today have such a passport: the seal </p>
<p>of the Spirit, which guarantees not their present personal well-being, but their </p>
<p>ultimate, eternal safety. God is for them—they have nothing to fear (see Rom </p>
<p>8:31).</p>
<p>In 1:11, Paul notes that in Christ believers enjoy an inheritance. In 1:13 </p>
<p>we nd a similar phrase “in him” used twice, with aorist participles, indi-</p>
<p>cating that the two clauses work together with the third main verb “you </p>
<p>were sealed.” is means that at the moment one hears and believes, one </p>
<p>is sealed with the Holy Spirit. Paul also speaks to the Ephesian believers </p>
<p>(“you”) as those who heard the message of truth aer he and those with </p>
