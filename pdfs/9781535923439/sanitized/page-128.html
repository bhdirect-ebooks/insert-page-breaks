<p>Fusing the Horizons: Refusing to Walk the Walk—So What?</p>

<p>context. In the ﬁrst century CE, to be condemned to ignorance was a terrible </p>
<p>and shameful fate. When someone decided to join a philosophical group, such </p>
<p>as follow a Stoic, Epicurean, or Cynic teacher, they expected to be taught both </p>
<p>how to think and how to act. The ancient world assumed this connection and </p>
<p>so any person interested in the virtuous life would look to the philosophers’ </p>
<p>teachings, expecting that with their new knowledge they would also modify </p>
<p>their lifestyle. A similar expectation would be present with the gospel message; </p>
<p>believers would assume that correct teachings would lead to proper actions. </p>
<p>Today, however, some wonder why Paul does not threaten the Ephesians with </p>
<p>punishment if they refuse to follow his directives on right behavior. But Paul </p>
<p>does not need to cry out hellﬁre and brimstone if his fellow believers don’t </p>
<p>change their ways, for he (and they) assume that they joined the church in </p>
<p>part to learn how to live differently. They would expect to be asked to change </p>
<p>behaviors, even as they would expect to learn different ideas. Because today’s </p>
<p>church can so narrowly deﬁne salvation as having the right answers, it ends up </p>
<p>separating what for Paul is an organic whole, thought and deed.</p>

<p>So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must </p>
<p>no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their think-</p>
<p>ing. </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>ey are darkened in their understanding and sepa-</p>
<p>rated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is </p>
<p>in them due to the hardening of their hearts. </p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Having lost </p>
<p>all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality </p>
<p>so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, and they are full </p>
<p>of greed. </p>

<p>at, however, is not the way of life you learned </p>
<p>21</p>
<p>when you heard about Christ and were taught in him in </p>
<p>accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. </p>
<p>22</p>
<p>You were taught, </p>
<p>with regard to your former way of life, to put o your old </p>
<p>self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; </p>
<p>23</p>
<p>to </p>
<p>be made new in the attitude of your minds; </p>
<p>24</p>
<p>and to put on </p>
<p>the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and </p>
<p>holiness. </p>
<p>25</p>
