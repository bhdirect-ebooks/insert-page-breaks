<p>Introduction</p>

<p>sensitive to the situation of ancient slavery and the realities of imprison-</p>
<p>ment. A close examination of the letter reveals language commonly used </p>
<p>in speaking about letter carriers and private messengers. Specically, Paul </p>
<p>implies that he would rather not send back Onesimus at that particular </p>
<p>moment (12–14), suggesting that Onesimus was permitted by Philemon </p>
<p>to stay only a specied amount of time.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>Moreover, Paul uses the verb</p>
<p>anapempō (to send back) in v. 12, which is oen used in correspondence </p>
<p>to signify the return of the messenger.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>In the end, it does seem to defy the odds that Onesimus, a runaway </p>
<p>slave, would be imprisoned with Paul, especially in a city as large as </p>
<p>Ephesus or Rome. Paul, as a Roman citizen, would not suer the same </p>
<p>fate as a slave, even in prison. Acts 16:22–24 records Paul’s chains and </p>
<p>imprisonment in the deepest recesses of the Philippian jail, and notes that </p>
<p>this treatment was unacceptable for a Roman citizen who had not yet </p>
<p>been condemned. e situation was resolved with an apology by the city </p>
<p>council (16:37–39). Again, why would Paul believe he had authority to </p>
<p>decide whether to return Onesimus to his owner? Surely once his status </p>
<p>was known, would not Onesimus be returned irrespective of Paul’s own </p>
<p>thoughts on the subject? Paul was chained to Roman guards; it seems </p>
<p>unlikely that they would have turned a blind eye to a runaway slave help-</p>
<p>ing their captive.</p>
<p>It must be noted as well that in the Roman period, a freed slave was </p>
<p>still beholden to his owner, under the latter’s power, much as a father </p>
<p>retained authority over his grown children. It would not be enough, then, </p>
<p>for Onesimus to be granted freedom, Philemon must also release him to </p>
<p>serve Paul and the ministry. Paul’s letter requesting as much ts this re-</p>
<p>construction of events. Finally, if one assumed that Onesimus was eeing </p>
<p>his owner, either as a runaway or as one seeking a mediator, then a more </p>
<p>cynical (but possible) reading of his situation was that he agreed to the </p>
<p>gospel message only to enhance his standing with Paul. One might argue </p>
<p>that Philemon (and Paul) would suspect the genuineness of Onesimus’s </p>
<p>conversion, inasmuch as his profession of faith was a key argument for his </p>
<p>release and forgiveness of all past deeds and debts. But if Philemon sent </p>
<p>Onesimus to Paul, the genuineness of the latter’s conversion is on more </p>
<p>solid ground.</p>
