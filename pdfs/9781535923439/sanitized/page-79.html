<p>Salvation Is God’s Gi</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>clause “through faith.” He follows with the qualier “and this is not from </p>
<p>yourselves, it is the gi of God.” Several questions rise to the surface, in-</p>
<p>cluding the meaning of “through faith” as well as the antecedent of “this” </p>
<p>and the meaning of “gi.” To the rst point, many understand “through </p>
faith” to be the individual’s subjective appropriation of God’s salvation.
<p>Paul’s point is that God’s salvation is accepted on the basis of trust and </p>
<p>condence in God’s promises and deeds worked in Christ Jesus that make </p>
<p>possible salvation (Gal 2:16). However, some point to Phil 3:9 as a parallel </p>
<p>(“through faith in/of Christ”) and argue that the genitive construction </p>
<p>“faith in/of Christ” is best understood as the “faithfulness of Christ.” In </p>
<p>Eph 2:8, they argue that Paul’s meaning is best conveyed as “you have </p>
<p>been saved through the faithfulness of Christ.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>e latter position has</p>
<p>the advantage of reinforcing Paul’s overall point that it is God who saves; </p>
<p>human eort is not part of the equation. Weakening this interpretation, </p>
<p>however, is the fact that the genitive phrase “of/in Christ” is not found </p>
<p>in Ephesians. To the second point, Paul speaks of “this” which is not of </p>
<p>ourselves. To what is he referring? “is” is a neuter word, while both </p>
<p>“faith” and “grace” are feminine. It is not grammatically impossible that </p>
<p>“this” refers back to either of these words. e immediately previous noun </p>
<p>“faith” is oen pointed to as the antecedent; Paul thus is saying that faith </p>
<p>itself is God’s gi. However, this is not the most natural reading of the </p>
<p>grammar. Some point to the verb participle “you have been saved,” as the </p>
<p>reference, but this participle is masculine, which again makes it less likely </p>
<p>the antecedent. Most probably, “this” refers back to the entire argument </p>
<p>Paul has made in the last few verses, namely, that one’s salvation is God’s </p>
<p>gracious act done from and through his abundant love and mercy.</p>
<p>e third feature of this passage to be highlighted is Paul’s term </p>
<p>“gi.” e word used here for “gi” (dōron) is not found elsewhere in Paul, </p>
<p>although it was a common term in his day. e word is used by other New </p>
<p>Testament writers oen in the context of oering sacrices (Matt 5:23–4; </p>
<p>23:18–19; Heb 5:1; 8:3–4). A related term (dōrea) is used in Eph 3:7; 4:7 </p>
<p>(see also Rom 3:24; 5:15, 17; 2 Cor 9:15) and has the sense of an un-</p>
<p>merited or undeserved gi or benet. A third word for gi, charisma, is </p>
<p>related to the word for “grace” (charis). Charisma is frequently used when </p>
<p>speaking of the spiritual gis of the Holy Spirit (Rom 12:6; 1 Cor 12:4) </p>
<p>or a gi of oce through the laying on of hands (1 Tim 4:14). We cannot </p>
<p>1. For a brief discussion of the options, see O’Brien 1999: 175.</p>
