<p>Introduction</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Kenny explores this question with a stylometric analysis, focused not on </p>
<p>key terms or unusual vocabulary, but on stylistic quirks and traits that </p>
<p>an author expresses unconsciously. For example, those from Pittsburgh </p>
<p>drink “pop” but in Philadelphia they drink “soda”; both use these syn-</p>
<p>onyms unconsciously and thus reveal their backgrounds. Kenny observed </p>
<p>the frequency of subordinate clauses and conjunctions (and, but), and </p>
discovered both great diversity and strong commonality between all of
<p>the Pauline letters.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Interestingly, letters closest to what is understood as</p>
<p>the center of Paul’s thought were those he wrote alone (with a secretary), </p>
<p>namely Romans, Philippians, and 2 Timothy. Ephesians, heavily indebted </p>
<p>to Colossians (coauthored by Timothy) is farther down the list, but still </p>
<p>closer to the center than 1 Corinthians, the only letter coauthored with </p>
<p>Sosthenes. is evidence suggests that Paul’s coauthors might have played </p>
<p>a larger role in the nished product than has been previously thought.</p>
<p>One nal note about letters: in the ancient world, as today, they fre-</p>
<p>quently substitute for the personal presence of the writer. Oen Paul will </p>
<p>declare that he longs to see his congregation, but must be satised with </p>
<p>sending them a letter. e implication of this is that we expect that the au-</p>
<p>thor knows his audience well. For the most part this holds true for Paul’s </p>
<p>letters, with a few important exceptions. In the case of Romans, Paul is </p>
<p>introducing himself to the Christian community in the imperial capital in </p>
<p>hopes of soon visiting them. Similarly, Paul (with Timothy) writes to the </p>
<p>Colossians with authority, although it is one of his coworkers, Epaphras, </p>
<p>who founded the church. Yet in both cases, mutual friends are listed at the </p>
<p>end of the letters. In fact, Romans has the longest list of personal friends, </p>
<p>which might not be surprising if Paul is trying to form a relationship with </p>
<p>the Roman church. What would be more natural than to cite common ac-</p>
<p>quaintances? Ephesians lacks both a sense of intimacy with the congrega-</p>
<p>tion, as well as names of specic church members, which are unexpected, </p>
<p>given that he spent over two years there according to Acts. However, </p>
<p>Paul’s communications to the essalonians has no personal references, </p>
<p>even though Paul founded that church only a few months before writing </p>
<p>his letters from Corinth (Acts 18:5; 1 ess 3:6). Any explanation about </p>
<p>Pauline authorship of Ephesians must take into account the relative lack </p>
<p>of statements of personal knowledge about the addressees. Most explain </p>
<p>this as indicating either that the letter was not written by Paul, or that the </p>
