<p>Ephesians 5:21–33</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>that the spirit of prophecy submits to the speaker, for God is a God of </p>
<p>order (1 Cor 14:32–33).</p>
<p>One of the rst things the reader notes when looking at the text in </p>
<p>Greek is that the verb is lacking in 5:22. e verb must be taken from </p>
<p>5:21, and so many see 5:21 as a bridge between the comments about being </p>
<p>lled with the Spirit and living in the household. We saw that 5:18 con-</p>
<p>tained the commands to not be drunk with wine but lled with the Spirit. </p>
<p>Several participles follow, including the phrase in 5:21 about submitting </p>
<p>to each other out of fear of Christ. e English translations oen change </p>
<p>the participle into the indicative (submit) but that can separate 5:21 from </p>
<p>the main verb clause in 5:18. Paul connects through the use of participles </p>
<p>his insistence on life in the Spirit with his discussion about submission.</p>
<p>e social conventions of his day limit Paul’s options as he instructed </p>
<p>the church, much as a sculptor is limited by the shape and color of her </p>
<p>stone and the painter is limited by the size of his canvas. Paul’s words </p>
<p>would carry certain shared meanings that t the context. So what does </p>
<p>Paul mean that believers submit to each other (5:21)? is sounded like </p>
<p>a contradiction because submission implied a loss of status for the one </p>
<p>who submits. But for Paul, status is tied to being in Christ, and since all </p>
<p>are of equal status in Christ, then no one loses face when submitting to </p>
<p>another. Indeed, Paul’s revolutionary insight is that if the believer’s life is </p>
<p>hid in Christ, if the believer died in Christ and is raised to new life, then </p>
<p>submitting to another believer was merely submitting to Christ himself. </p>
<p>To the Corinthians Paul explains that the body of Christ, while it has </p>
<p>many members, does not rank those members based on social status or </p>
<p>value them based on their ancestry (1 Cor 12:7–26). To the ancient mind, </p>
<p>this was a recipe for chaos, but Paul assures the Corinthians that the Spirit </p>
<p>will give leadership gis and will expect each to look to the benet of the </p>
<p>whole (1 Cor 12:27—13:8; 14:29–33).</p>
<p>With its call for believers to submit to each other, the verb in 5:21 </p>
<p>governs 5:22 and its instructions for wives to submit to their own hus-</p>
<p>bands as to the Lord. Note that Paul qualies “submit” in both verses: </p>
<p>in 5:21 with the phrase “out of reverence for Christ” and in 5:22 as “to </p>
<p>the Lord.” Paul pictures each believer as submitting to Christ, and that </p>
<p>is shown by submitting to the other members of Christ’s body. is par-</p>
<p>ticiple can be interpreted as either middle or passive (being submissive </p>
<p>or submitting yourselves), which aects the interpretation. e passive </p>
<p>voice would imply that the person instructed has little say in the matter, </p>
