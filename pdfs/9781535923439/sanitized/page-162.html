<p>son above you in the social hierarchy. Paul stresses that fear and respect is </p>
<p>the proper attitude owed by humans to their God.</p>
<p>Paul observes that slaves actually have two masters: the earthly mas-</p>
<p>ter, who may or may not be charitable and kind, and a heavenly Master </p>
<p>who is just, good, rewards generously, and who is the Master of their </p>
<p>owner as well. ey should look to this second master when performing </p>
<p>their tasks in obedience to their earthly owner. As is true of any believer </p>
<p>doing a task, the focus is on humility of heart before Christ. Paul cau-</p>
<p>tions them not to serve only when the master is watching, thereby giving </p>
<p>a false impression of their work ethic. eir service should come from </p>
<p>their heart, which is set on Christ’s promises that good and faithful labor </p>
<p>will be rewarded. He uses similar language when writing to the Galatians </p>
<p>about his apostleship. He asks them whether his gospel message indicates </p>
<p>that he is trying to please people (Gal 1:10). He answers that, far from </p>
<p>pleasing people, his gospel indicates that he is a slave of Christ. To both </p>
<p>the Romans and the Philippians Paul introduces himself as Christ’s slave </p>
<p>(Rom 1:1; Phil 1:1). is association became a marker of Christian lead-</p>
<p>ers, as seen in Jas 1:1 where the Lord’s brother identies himself as a slave </p>
<p>of God and of the Lord.</p>
<p>So far what has been said about working humbly for Christ and not </p>
<p>for others would apply to any job situation. But Paul is speaking here </p>
<p>about slavery, not simply particular tasks an employer might require. e </p>
<p>slave had no rights, no freedoms, no hope outside of his owners’ good-</p>
<p>will. She had no opportunity to marry, and could not raise her children </p>
<p>as she determined, for both depended upon her master. e male and </p>
<p>female slave’s life was not their own; even more, their life was judged by </p>
<p>the honor culture as the most shameful. To this reality I wish our text had </p>
<p>cried out “Freedom for all.” Perhaps a close reading reveals as much, as we </p>
<p>turn to examine Paul’s charge to owners.</p>
<p>Paul commands masters to do the “same things” to their slaves </p>
<p>(TNIV: “in the same way”). Paul has connected owners and slaves under </p>
<p>one Master, Christ Jesus. He now asks that masters treat their slaves with </p>
<p>the same humility and sincerity (see Col 4:1), with the knowledge that </p>
<p>Christ expects just, fair, and kind treatment. Paul elaborates that masters </p>
<p>must cease from intimidating their slaves, frightening them with threats </p>
<p>of beatings, abuses, separation from their birth children, and bodily in-</p>
<p>jury. Such cruelty was not outlawed, although some philosophers such </p>
<p>as Seneca spoke against such abuses. Paul declares that owners who treat </p>
