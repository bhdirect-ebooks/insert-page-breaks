<p>Authorship of Ephesians</p>
<p>Pauline authorship of Ephesians is contested, with several reasons put </p>
<p>forward to suggest Paul did not write the epistle. For some, the language, </p>
<p>its terms and grammar, sound too dierent from the undisputed letters </p>
<p>(Romans, Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Philippians, 1 essalonians, </p>
<p>Philemon) to be written by the same hand. For others, the theology, es-</p>
<p>pecially ecclesiology and soteriology, are suciently distinct to warrant </p>
<p>pause in proclaiming Pauline authorship. Again, the apparent acceptance </p>
<p>of Greco-Roman social status quo—the hierarchy of father, wife, chil-</p>
<p>dren, slaves—speaks against this letter being written by the same author </p>
<p>who penned 1 Corinthians. ese concerns should not be dismissed </p>
<p>lightly; however, they are capable of interpretation in a way that holds </p>
<p>to Pauline authorship. Moreover, postulating a deutero-Pauline status for </p>
<p>Ephesians does not solve all problems; indeed, it can create new ones, </p>
<p>such as demonstrating the relative acceptance of pseudonymous</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> author-</p>
<p>ship and pseudepigraphic</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>work in the ancient world, their acceptance</p>
<p>within the early church, and the reason for detailed personal information </p>
<p>in Ephesians. In the end, I suggest the balance of the evidence weighs </p>
<p>on the side of Pauline authorship, but I invite the readers to examine the </p>
<p>evidence below to satisfy themselves on the matter.</p>
<p>Ancient Letter-Writing Practices</p>
<p>e letter itself claims to be from Paul, who states his name and then </p>
<p>describes himself as an apostle of Christ Jesus (1:1) and later as a prisoner </p>
<p>of Christ Jesus (3:1, see also 4:1, 6:20). Most of the undisputed letters </p>
<p>begin with Paul declaring himself an apostle of Christ Jesus, although the </p>
<p>formula is not rigidly followed, for in 1 Cor 1:1 he declares he was called </p>
<p>as an apostle, while to the Romans he announces himself a slave of Christ </p>
<p>Jesus who was called to be an apostle. e opening description of Paul </p>
<p>in Ephesians, then, does not present any immediate hint of irregularity </p>
<p>5. is term for our purposes does not include nom de plume such as Samuel Clemens’ </p>
<p>pen name Mark Twain.</p>
<p>6. Pseudepigraphy is a label of a work whose author uses another, usually better </p>
<p>known name, while pseudepigrapha refers to a particular set of extra-canonical or post-</p>
<p>canonical works. e term pseudonymity identies the author as using another name, </p>
<p>which may take the form of a nom de plume or a borrowed name from a well-known </p>
<p>author.</p>
