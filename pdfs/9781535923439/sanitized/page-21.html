<p>Introduction</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>day we imagine him sitting quietly at his desk, pen in hand etching strange </p>
<p>Greek characters on papyrus scrolls. In the ancient world, however, most </p>
<p>people did not write down their own letters but used the services of a </p>
<p>scribe. In some cases it was a personal slave or employee, in others it was </p>
<p>a hired service. In our particular situation, this means that Paul did not </p>
<p>actually write any of his letters, if by that one means that he put pen to </p>
<p>papyrus. Rather, Paul used the services of others, a scribe or amanuensis, </p>
<p>to take down his letter. us when Paul declares to the Galatians or the </p>
<p>essalonians that he is writing to them, he is describing his personal </p>
<p>signature and closing remarks (Gal 6:11; 2 ess 3:17). How much of the </p>
<p>scribe’s own personal style infused the letter? is is dicult to determine, </p>
<p>but the range of scribal activity extends from taking dictation syllable by </p>
<p>syllable, to composing a letter based on general instructions. In almost </p>
<p>all cases, the author would review the letter dra before a nal copy was </p>
<p>made and sent. We also do not know if Paul used the same scribe several </p>
<p>times. One scribe identies himself as Tertius (Rom 16:22; see also 1 Pet </p>
<p>5:12), but we do not know if he wrote any of Paul’s other letters. Romans </p>
<p>was likely written from Corinth during Paul’s third missionary journey, </p>
<p>and we would have to postulate that Tertius was with Paul in other cities </p>
<p>or over the course of his journeys to suppose that he wrote other let-</p>
<p>ters, which is not an impossible scenario, but one for which we have no </p>
<p>information. We should not forget that for several letters Paul is impris-</p>
<p>oned (Philippians, Colossians, Philemon), which further complicates his </p>
<p>options. We should pause for a moment to observe that Paul coauthors </p>
<p>most of his letters; this fact has not usually penetrated discussions about </p>
<p>authenticity. is is a rare, almost unique innovation, for we have no </p>
<p>evidence that Cicero, Seneca, or Pliny the Younger, for example, ever co-</p>
<p>authored a letter. It seems that Cicero’s friend Atticus did write one letter </p>
<p>with a group of people,</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>and Richards identied six coauthored letters out</p>
<p>of the 645 private letters from the Oxyrhynchus corpus, but these are not </p>
<p>at all similar to Paul’s letters.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Only Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, and</p>
<p>the Pastoral Epistles are authored by Paul alone (with the aid of a scribe). </p>
<p>How involved were Titus, Timothy, and Sosthenes in the content and style </p>
<p>of Paul’s other letters? Was it merely courteous of Paul to note his cowork-</p>
<p>ers, or did they have signicant input with content and style? Anthony </p>
