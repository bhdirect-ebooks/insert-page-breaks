<p>One Body in Christ, Diverse Gis</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>and through all and in all. </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>But to each one of us grace has </p>
<p>been given as Christ apportioned it. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>is is why it says: </p>
<p>“When he ascended on high, </p>
<p>he took many captives </p>
<p>and gave gis to his people.” </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>(What does “he ascended” mean except that he also de-</p>
<p>scended to the lower, earthly regions? </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>He who descended </p>
<p>is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in </p>
<p>order to ll the whole universe.) </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>So Christ himself gave the </p>
<p>apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teach-</p>
<p>ers, </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>to equip his people for works of service, so that the </p>
<p>body of Christ may be built up </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>until we all reach unity in </p>
<p>the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and be-</p>
<p>come mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness </p>
<p>of Christ. </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>en we will no longer be infants, tossed back </p>
<p>and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every </p>
<p>wind of teaching and by the cunning and crainess of people </p>
<p>in their deceitful scheming. </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Instead, speaking the truth in </p>
<p>love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the head, </p>
<p>that is, Christ. </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>From him the whole body, joined and held </p>
<p>together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds it-</p>
<p>self up in love, as each part does its work.</p>
<p>Christians rightly stress the importance of understanding God’s work in </p>
<p>Christ, and the centuries of creedal formation attest to the critical nature </p>
<p>of getting theology correct. Far too oen, however, believers stop at that </p>
<p>point, resting complacently in their (false) assumption that to know the </p>
<p>right answer is to be right with God. Paul’s injunctions to the Ephesians </p>
<p>suggests otherwise. Right theology leads to right living; indeed the two </p>
<p>are not easily compartmentalized, as Paul’s comments attest. His argu-</p>
<p>ment begins with a call to walk uprightly, but quickly grows to include </p>
<p>a declaration of God’s oneness and the church’s one calling. eological </p>
<p>truths support ethical behavior: to have the former without the latter is </p>
<p>the height of arrogance, and to have the latter without the former is hol-</p>
<p>low legalism. e structure of his argument ows from a call to walk in a </p>
<p>manner consistent with their calling as believers (4:1–6), followed by two </p>
