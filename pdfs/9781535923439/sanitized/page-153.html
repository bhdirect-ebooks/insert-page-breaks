<p>Wives and Husbands Addressed</p>

<p>Husbands Love Your Wives (5:25–33)</p>
<p>Paul’s lengthy charge that husbands love their wives includes several im-</p>
<p>portant features. First, while the term “body” (soma) is carried over from </p>
<p>the verses above, the term “head” is not. Moreover, he shis from using </p>
<p>“body” metaphorically to speaking literally of the physical body in the </p>
<p>course of his argument. Related to this is Paul’s use of the term “esh” </p>
<p>(sarx), which further reinforces the literal sense of “body.” Second, Paul </p>
<p>speaks of similarity and unity as opposed to distinction and dierence as </p>
<p>he did in his charge to wives. ird, Paul focuses extensively on Christ’s </p>
<p>love and self-giving for the church. Fourth, the work of Christ for the </p>
<p>church has eschatological dimensions, for the church will be presented to </p>
<p>Christ as holy and blameless. Fih, Christ’s relationship to the church is a </p>
<p>mystery in its unity and oneness.</p>
<p>Unlike the charge to wives, where the participle “submit” is carried </p>
<p>over from the previous verse, in 5:25 Paul commands husbands to love </p>
<p>their wives. e verb is the cognate of the noun agapē, the self-giving </p>
<p>love characterizing Christ’s love for the church. A husband’s love is more </p>
<p>than romantic feelings, although these feelings were an expected part of </p>
<p>marriage. Paul describes this love as self-giving (5:25) and, ironically, as </p>
<p>self-referential (5:28) inasmuch as the husband is to love his wife as he </p>
<p>loves himself. Additionally, while the husband is to love his wife as Christ </p>
<p>does the church, the result of this love diers. e husband’s love is shown </p>
<p>in the care given to his wife, while Christ’s love is redemptive and sancti-</p>
<p>fying, and carries eschatological power (5:26).</p>
<p>Paul connects his rst call for the husband to love his wife with </p>
<p>Christ’s love and self-giving for the church. e second charge to love </p>
<p>one’s wife gives a reason for this behavior. Paul declares that a husband </p>
<p>and wife are one body, thus the husband should show the same regard </p>
<p>for his wife as he shows for himself. Paul speaks both metaphorically and </p>
<p>literally here when using “body.” And to expand on both meanings, he in-</p>
<p>troduces the term “esh.” He speaks of the husband’s literal esh which is </p>
<p>fed and clothed, and metaphorically of the wife as one esh with her hus-</p>
<p>band. is metaphor provides the opportunity to bring in the description </p>
<p>of marriage in Gen 2:24. e New Testament (following the LXX) adjusts </p>
<p>the Old Testament language by saying that “the two become one esh,” (see </p>
<p>Matt 19:5). is shi modies the Hebrew “they shall become one esh,” </p>
<p>which accommodated polygyny. By the Hellenistic period monogamy </p>
