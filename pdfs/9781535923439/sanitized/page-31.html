<p>as some understand 1:20–22 to say. In Ephesians, as in the rest of the </p>
<p>Pauline corpus, believers live in the tension between the now and the not </p>
<p>yet; now is the time of salvation, but as of yet, not all that Christ has ac-</p>
<p>complished on the cross has been realized.</p>
<p>Finally, much has been made of the universal church described by </p>
<p>Ephesians. Because Paul deals only with the local community in his other </p>
<p>letters, so the argument contends, Ephesians must be deutero-Pauline. </p>
<p>While it is true that Paul does not refer to the local church in Ephesians, </p>
<p>it must also be stated that he does refer to the universal church in the un-</p>
<p>contested letters. In 1 Corinthians, he addresses the letter not only to the </p>
<p>local congregation but to all those everywhere who likewise call upon the </p>
<p>name of the Lord Jesus (1 Cor 1:2). Moreover, he speaks to the Corinthians </p>
<p>of baptism into one Spirit (1 Cor 12:7–14, see also Gal 3:27–9). e body </p>
<p>of Christ is described as having various parts or dedicated ministries, </p>
<p>such as apostles, prophets, teachers, and so on (12:27–31), with no hint </p>
<p>that this conguration is based on the local church (a similar listing is </p>
<p>found in Eph 4:11–13). In both Romans and Galatians, Paul speaks of </p>
<p>believers as children of Abraham (Gal 3:29; Rom 4:16), clearly imagining </p>
<p>a wide-reaching community. Lastly, as Paul describes his persecution of </p>
<p>believers, he speaks of attacking the church of God, implying not isolated </p>
<p>congregations but a larger group of communities (Gal 1:13; 1 Cor 15:9; </p>
<p>Phil 3:6). Paul refers to the church as the “Israel of God” in Gal 6:16. Just </p>
as an individual synagogue would hardly imagine itself as other than part
<p>of the larger Jewish community, it appears that Paul too sees each congre-</p>
<p>gation as connected to a larger entity, what he can refer to as the body of </p>
<p>Christ (Eph 5:29; 1 Cor 12:13).</p>
<p>A nal sticking point is Paul’s declaration that the church is built </p>
<p>on the apostles and prophets (Eph 2:20). is is said to conict with his </p>
<p>claim that the church’s foundation is Christ (1 Cor 3:11, see also Col 2:7). </p>
<p>But is there a sharp dierence? Paul understands his apostolic ministry </p>
<p>as speaking only of God’s work in and through Christ, that is, the gospel </p>
<p>and its ramications. He is not at liberty to expand or eliminate any part </p>
<p>of the tradition handed down to him. However, Paul should be given the </p>
<p>exibility to develop imagery that best describes the concepts, for his </p>
<p>metaphors gain much of their power because they are dynamic. In Eph </p>
<p>2:20, Paul describes Christ Jesus as the chief cornerstone that secures the </p>
<p>foundation of the building (the church), a sentiment not at all foreign to </p>
