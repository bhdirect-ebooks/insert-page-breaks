<p>8:38-9, 11:33–39; 1 Cor 1:4–8; Phil 1:3–8; and 2 ess 1:3–10) or about </p>
<p>doctrine (Rom 3:21–26; 1 Cor 1:26–29), or concerning ethical matters </p>
<p>(compare Eph 6:14–20; 1 Cor 12:8–11; and Phil 1:27—2:11). In the past, </p>
<p>statistical analysis was used to support a deutero-Pauline position. But </p>
<p>more recently this method has been called into question, due in no small </p>
<p>part to the lack of material by Paul himself. Even though he has written </p>
<p>many letters in the New Testament, the actual corpus is relatively small, </p>
<p>failing to provide a statistically signicant amount of words from which </p>
<p>to draw conclusions. Even more, when Ephesians is compared, for exam-</p>
<p>ple, with the uncontested Galatians, the results are surprising. e letters </p>
<p>are about the same length, and each contain about the same number of </p>
<p>terms occurring only in that epistle (41 terms out of 2,429 in Ephesians, </p>
<p>35 terms [or 31 if you subtract proper names] out of 2,220 in Galatians) </p>
<p>and similar numbers of terms unique to the epistle but found in the New </p>
<p>Testament outside of the Pauline corpus (84 in Ephesians, 90 [(80 if you </p>
<p>subtract proper names] in Galatians).</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Phrases we readily associate with</p>
<p>Paul, such as “fruit of the Spirit” or “present evil age” or “the marks of </p>
<p>Jesus,” are found only in Galatians, but these are not used to disqualify </p>
<p>that epistle as written by Paul. Instead, it is recognized that Paul’s audi-</p>
<p>ence, the situation faced by Paul and the letter’s recipients, as well as Paul’s </p>
<p>theological creativity and energy, all play a role in his choice of expres-</p>
<p>sion, style, and mood. Finally, some point to the expressions that serve to </p>
<p>identify writers, much as a speaker’s tone of voice and idiomatic turn of </p>
<p>phrase serve to identify them. In particular, it is suggested that Ephesians </p>
<p>has an unusually high number of the prepositions kata (according to or </p>
<p>against) and en (in). However, Galatians actually uses kata with the geni-</p>
<p>tive more than any other Pauline letter. Again, Romans uses dia (because </p>
<p>of or through) and para (beside) more frequently, while Philippians pre-</p>
<p>fers meta (aer or with) and peri (around or concerning). Even more, </p>
<p>Ephesians shares with Romans, Galatians, and 1 and 2 essalonians the </p>
<p>special construction ara . . . oun (therefore . . . therefore).</p>
