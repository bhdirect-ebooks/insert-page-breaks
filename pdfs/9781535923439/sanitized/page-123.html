<p>e Gi to Grow On</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>Paul defends his claim in 4:7 that Christ gives grace by citing Ps 68:18, </p>
<p>which includes an interesting phrase “he took many captives” or “taking </p>
<p>captivity captive.” Christ takes captive through his death and resurrection </p>
<p>the powers of this present age of captivity to evil and death. e ironic </p>
<p>corollary is that Christ can be said to defeat all captivities. In this freedom </p>
<p>from captivity, Christ has the power to bestow gis. Such language brings </p>
<p>to mind both Paul’s own chains, and also the captivity that Gentiles long </p>
<p>suered. Paul knew that his own prison chains were but conrmation of </p>
<p>his apostleship to the Gentiles, who now enjoy the full measure of God’s </p>
<p>grace through Christ. In quoting a few lines from this psalm, Paul points </p>
<p>to the entire song of praise celebrating God’s great victory over evil and </p>
<p>Israel’s enemies. Interestingly, in Hebrew the verse quoted by Paul reads, </p>
<p>“and he received gis from men.” e Greek text, from which Paul quotes, </p>
<p>reads “and he gave gis to people.” e change is likely due to a reversal </p>
<p>of two Hebrew letters in the verb, but Jerome</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>suggests that because the</p>
<p>psalmist looked forward to the day when Christ would be victorious, he </p>
<p>used the word “received,” but Paul could now use the term “gave” because </p>
<p>Christ’s redemptive work on the cross is nished. Moreover, it was typical </p>
<p>in Paul’s day for the victorious general, aer he collected all the plunder, </p>
<p>to distribute it among his faithful soldiers.</p>
<p>While the psalm focuses on the ascent, marking God’s victory, Paul </p>
<p>elaborates that the ascent necessarily implies a descent. Most see an allu-</p>
<p>sion to the incarnation, and his ascent a reference to his resurrection and </p>
<p>victory over sin and death, which awaits nal consummation. Because he </p>
<p>is over all things, he has the authority and right to grant gis. A similar </p>
<p>claim is made in 1:23; here Paul explains that Christ is lled with God’s </p>
<p>fullness, and Christ lls the church with that fullness.</p>
<p>It is out of this fullness that apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, </p>
<p>and teachers are given. Right away we are confronted with two problems. </p>
<p>First, the Greek literally reads, “he gave some apostles, some prophets,” </p>
<p>and so on. Oen translators insert a “to be” verb, so that the verse would </p>
<p>read “he gave some to be apostles” or “the gis he gave were that some </p>
<p>would be apostles.” is is certainly possible, given that in Greek one need </p>
<p>not include the verb “to be” in every situation. But did Paul expect his </p>
<p>readers to insert the verb here? If we answer yes, then we likely see 4:7 as </p>
<p>anticipating the giving of dierent gis. As noted above, this seems a less </p>
