<p>Ephesians 2:1–10</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>inuence of the esh. A similar toggle between “you” and “we” is found </p>
<p>in Col 2:11–14. Paul notes that the Gentile believers were (spiritually) cir-</p>
<p>cumcised in Christ, paralleling this image with that of their baptism. He </p>
<p>continues that their uncircumcised nature was made alive in Christ. But </p>
<p>then Paul speaks of Christ’s forgiveness, and here he uses “we” to celebrate </p>
<p>the canceled debt that had condemned all humans. Paul’s message in Rom </p>
<p>7:5 is relevant here: the esh (sinful nature) works against the good law </p>
<p>of God, causing Jews who love the law to disobey it. Jews and Gentiles are </p>
<p>equally guilty before God, but they arrive at their guilty status from dif-</p>
<p>ferent paths. Gentiles are idolaters; they have forsaken the one true God </p>
<p>and follow idols. Jews know God’s revelation, and have the advantages of </p>
<p>the Law, the prophets, the temple, the promises, the covenants (see Rom </p>
<p>9:4–5), but they have not all acted from the wellspring of faith. So in the </p>
<p>end, all are in need of God’s grace.</p>
<p>Why is it important to emphasize this dierence between Jews and </p>
<p>Gentiles? First, because it is the best way to make sense of Paul’s later </p>
<p>argument that Christ’s power is seen in making the two groups into one </p>
<p>people. Paul believes that the two becoming one body is a powerful </p>
<p>mystery, mysterious because it is so grand, so bold a plan, and powerful </p>
<p>because through this one body, the church, God is declaring to the rulers </p>
<p>and the authorities his unsearchable grace and unfathomable love. e </p>
<p>miraculous creation of a new people, holy and wholly devoted to God, </p>
<p>stands against the claims of the present age. e world calls for domina-</p>
<p>tion, selshness, and independence from others and God, but God’s grace </p>
<p>given without respect of person (to Jew, Gentile, free, slave, male, female, </p>
and any other division humanity can think up) decisively ends all conver-
<p>sation (3:10). In and with Christ, the church, the two being one, stands as </p>
<p>a testimony to God’s love and power over against the social and political </p>
divisions that characterize our world. In a similar vein, Paul declares to
<p>the Philippians that by standing in one spirit for the faith of the gospel, </p>
<p>they prove their opponents’ destruction, and the Philippians’ own salva-</p>
<p>tion (Phil 1:27–28).</p>
<p>Second, focusing on the use of “you” and “we” helps explain why </p>
<p>Paul declares “you have been saved” in 2:6, 8, rather than “we have been </p>
<p>saved.” Note that in 2:4 Paul introduces the subject of this long sentence </p>
<p>(the sentence in Greek runs nine verses), namely God, and in 2:5–6 we </p>
<p>have the main verbs: made alive, raised, and seated. Each of these verbs </p>
<p>is in the past tense (aorist), indicating that God has done and nished </p>
