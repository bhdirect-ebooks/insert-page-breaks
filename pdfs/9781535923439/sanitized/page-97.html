<p>Paul’s Rhetorical Strategy</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>sake of the Gentiles to whom he preaches the mystery of God’s redemp-</p>
<p>tion in Christ.</p>
<p>Paul’s Personal Character Revealed by His Chains</p>
<p>Based on Paul’s statement in 3:13, part of his reasoning for emphasizing </p>
<p>his imprisonment is to reassure the Ephesians. But he does more than </p>
<p>that, oering a robust theological argument about the value of his situ-</p>
<p>ation. In 3:1 he declares that he is a prisoner, not of Rome (which he is </p>
<p>at one level), but of Christ. His point is that the physical chains that link </p>
<p>him to a Roman soldier tell the story not of a plan gone horribly wrong, </p>
<p>but of the wisdom of the Creator God who has orchestrated redemption </p>
<p>of all people through Christ. He makes this point by introducing his </p>
<p>imprisonment with the phrase “for this reason.” is transitional clause </p>
<p>points backwards to chapter 2 and its astonishing claims that Gentiles are </p>
<p>fellow citizens with God’s people, they are members of God’s household, </p>
<p>and they are part of God’s temple. Paul’s imprisonment is a testimony to </p>
<p>his faithful declaration of Christ’s work in making the two one, bringing </p>
<p>together Jew and Gentile. Most likely the Ephesians would have known </p>
<p>that Paul was accused of bringing a Gentile into the area of the Jerusalem </p>
<p>temple reserved for Jews (Acts 21:27–29). It was this charge that started </p>
<p>the years-long imprisonment beginning in Caesarea and ending in Rome </p>
<p>(Acts 28:30–31). ough Paul was innocent of those specic charges, he </p>
<p>freely admitted he was guilty of teaching that through Christ Gentiles </p>
<p>were now part of God’s people. His chains testify to his steadfast, unwav-</p>
<p>ering commitment to God’s appointment to preach this good news.</p>
<p>His chains, in other words, are the physical evidence that he is a </p>
<p>trusted minister of God, willing to face any aiction for the truth that </p>
<p>Gentiles are fellow heirs with Jews in God’s household. His character is </p>
<p>praiseworthy in that he fullls his responsibilities before God in preach-</p>
<p>ing the gospel to them. In the ancient world, a teacher must be morally </p>
<p>upright, for the students were to model their lives on their teacher’s ex-</p>
<p>ample. Paul asks the Corinthians to follow his lead, as he follows Christ </p>
<p>(1 Cor 11:1). He points to his own behavior among the essalonians as </p>
<p>worthy of imitation (1 es 2:4–12). e Ephesians likewise would ap-</p>
<p>preciate that Paul modeled for them the proper posture before God. ey </p>
<p>would feel sympathetic towards and attached to Paul, knowing that he </p>
<p>was willing to undergo hardships on their behalf.</p>
