<p>Ephesians 3:1–13</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>e Mystery of Christ</p>
<p>Knowing why he oered this personal description provides the platform to </p>
<p>look more deeply into the content. Only three sentences in Greek, 3:2–13 </p>
<p>interrupt his opening lines in 3:1. Verses 2–7 reect on Paul’s position as </p>
<p>a prisoner and the mystery of God’s redemption from one angle, and vv. </p>
<p>8–12 pick up both emphases from a second viewpoint. In both cases, Paul </p>
<p>builds on the theological claims of the previous chapter, further reecting </p>
<p>on the images of believers (Jew and Gentile) as the body of Christ, as the </p>
<p>household of God, and as the holy temple to the Lord. Verse 3:13 oers a </p>
<p>reason for the digression, namely that his Gentile congregants would not </p>
<p>despair of his situation, but take heart that his chains and aictions are </p>
<p>actually evidence of God’s redemption in Christ extended to Gentiles. But </p>
<p>the digression not only builds rapport between Paul and the Ephesians, </p>
<p>it also draws out implications of his previous claims of unity of Jew and </p>
<p>Gentile in Christ. e vehicle that carries much of this thought is the term </p>
<p>“mystery.”</p>
<p>Paul uses the term “mystery” three times in this chapter, as well as </p>
<p>in 1:9; 5:25; and 6:19. In 3:6 Paul states clearly that the mystery he re-</p>
<p>ceived by revelation (3:3) is the redemption plan of God that includes </p>
<p>Gentiles with Israel as co-heirs in Christ of God’s promises. Quite simply, </p>
<p>the mystery is the gospel, the work of Christ for the salvation of both Jew </p>
<p>and Gentile by faith. Additionally, Paul was commissioned by the Lord </p>
<p>to speak to the Gentiles (Acts 22:21; Gal 2:9). Nor is this gospel mes-</p>
<p>sage Paul’s private interpretation of God’s mystery; the holy apostles and </p>
<p>prophets (the foundation of the church, 2:20) were given this revelation </p>
<p>(3:5). But to see this mystery as only concerning personal salvation is to </p>
<p>miss the bigger picture. Paul hints at this in chapter 1, where he introduc-</p>
<p>es the term in the phrase “mystery of his will,” that is, God’s purpose that </p>
<p>redemption of all things is through Christ (1:9–10). Again, Paul explains </p>
<p>that the revelation of this mystery results in the church bearing witness </p>
<p>of God’s multifaceted wisdom to the heavenly powers and principalities </p>
<p>(3:10). Key to the mystery is the oneness of the church, which is further </p>
<p>emphasized in 5:25, as Paul compares the oneness of a married couple to </p>
<p>that union of Christ and his church.</p>
<p>Paul uses “mystery” in similar ways in other epistles. In Rom 11:25 </p>
<p>Paul speaks of the mystery of Israel’s hardening until the full number of </p>
<p>Gentiles is included. Again, in 16:25–26, Paul stresses the revelation of the </p>
