<p>all the saints.”</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Although this position rightly notes that the prepositional</p>
<p>change is not on its own indicative of a connection between the rst and </p>
<p>second clauses, the argument fails to account for adequately Paul’s general </p>
<p>emphasis in the passage, namely the activity of the saints. Paul refers to </p>
<p>them at the beginning of 4:12, not at the end,</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>where one might expect</p>
<p>them to be mentioned if Paul was focused on the ministers as this sec-</p>
<p>ond argument contends. In sum, Paul’s message about Christ’s gi to the </p>
<p>church is that the ministers might serve the saints so that the saints might </p>
<p>be well prepared to do the work of ministry. e goal for each group is a </p>
<p>stronger, healthier body of Christ.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Paul does not mention his own apostleship in this </p>
<p>discussion. In fact, except for the opening line of the epistle, he speaks </p>
<p>of himself not as an apostle but as a prisoner of Christ or an ambassa-</p>
<p>dor in chains. Since he is not shy about discussing his apostleship to the </p>
<p>Galatians or Corinthians, for example (1 Cor 4:9–16; 2 Cor 13:2–4, 10; </p>
<p>Gal 1:1, 11), we might wonder why the image of prisoner is front and </p>
<p>center here. He uses a term that conjures up the picture of someone in </p>
<p>chains (4:1), and then using a cognate term, speaks of the believers being </p>
<p>bound together (4:3). e word picture is interesting: I am a prisoner, and </p>
<p>you should be prisoners of each other. If Paul had called attention to his </p>
own apostleship, that would shi the focus to diverse charismata (as in
<p>Rom 12:4–8 and 1 Cor 12:4–13) rather than the gi of grace, maintaining </p>
<p>unity, which is extended to each believer.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Ministry and the Church</p>
<p>In 4:12, Paul explains the reason for Christ’s gift, that the saints would be </p>
<p>equipped to do the work of ministry. Today we tend to think of pastors as those </p>
<p>in the ministry, but Paul turns that picture on its head. It is the saints, each </p>
<p>and every believer, who do the ministry of the church. The gift Christ extends, </p>
<p>which is comprised of those who explain the gospel, serves to strengthen that </p>
<p>ministry. So often we think of church leadership and ministry as synonyms, </p>
<p>but actually the former is only a single aspect of the latter. Neufeld offers a </p>
<p>6. Lincoln 1990: 253.</p>
<p>7. O’Brien 1999: 302–5. He writes on 305, “e exalted Messiah gives ministries of </p>
<p>the word to equip God’s people for work in his service so as to build his body.”</p>
