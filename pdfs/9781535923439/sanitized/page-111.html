<p>Paul’s Prayer</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>vividness and creativity and its consistency with Paul’s teaching that the </p>
<p>cross is ecacious across the globe and through time. Another church </p>
<p>father, John Chrysostom,</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> suggests God’s love is in view, while Aquinas</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> </p>
<p>argues it is Christ’s love. Given Paul’s insistence on both the Father’s love </p>
<p>and the Lord’s love, these theories are strong as well. Paul has also stressed </p>
<p>God’s wisdom, made known in his salvation plan in Christ (3:10–11). </p>
<p>Perhaps Paul’s intention was to leave it deliberately vague, and thus inclu-</p>
<p>sive of both love and wisdom, symbolized in the cross. Paul is asking that </p>
<p>the believers appreciate the vastness of God’s inuence and control over </p>
<p>the created order. “We thus should understand grasping the four dimen-</p>
<p>sions as an invitation to grasp reality fully.”</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Paul continues that this understanding is comprehensible only </p>
<p>through the love of Christ, which surpasses all human knowledge. All this </p>
<p>is possible because God’s love and power is beyond anything we imagine, </p>
<p>and because that power is active within us through Christ. If we had only </p>
<p>knowledge of God’s vastness, it would overwhelm our human frailty. But </p>
<p>Paul anticipates this, and sandwiches his request for understanding be-</p>
<p>tween two pronouncements that love grounds and governs everything, </p>
<p>including knowledge. It is not simply that God is greater than anything </p>
<p>we can imagine, but that this great God is for us.</p>
<p>At the end of 3:19 we nd our nal hina clause, which signals the </p>
<p>purpose behind Paul’s beseeching: that the Ephesians might be lled with </p>
<p>(or to) the fullness of God. Earlier in 1:23, using the same verb and noun, </p>
<p>Paul explained that the church is Christ’s body, which holds the fullness </p>
<p>of Christ, who is lled with God’s fullness entirely. In ch. 1, the context </p>
<p>was Paul’s thanksgiving and prayers that the Ephesians would perceive </p>
<p>the hope of their calling, the wealth of their inheritance, and the great </p>
<p>power of the one who works out our salvation (1:18–19). His prayer in </p>
<p>3:19 is similar, that they might be saturated with God’s completeness and </p>
<p>abundance, much like a sponge that can hold no more water.</p>
<p>e preposition used by Paul (eis) can be translated “with” or “into.” </p>
<p>In the rst reading, the sense is that believers will be lled up with God’s </p>
<p>fullness; in the second, that believers will be lled to (into, towards) God’s </p>
<p>fullness. e second sense captures the idea of maturity and growth, that </p>
