<p>of two things: either Paul had in mind only leaders of the church when </p>
<p>he spoke of the grace and gi given, or he intended to include everyone </p>
<p>as receiving the grace. I think the latter is more likely, especially because </p>
<p>Paul does not identify himself as an apostle in this chapter, but as a pris-</p>
<p>oner in the Lord.</p>
<p>Finally, the argument that Paul speaks in 4:7 about gis oen treats </p>
<p>grace and gi (understood as a plural) as synonyms. A possible subtext </p>
<p>of this interpretive move is that while Christ gives grace to everyone, he </p>
<p>gives a bit more to some, and we call them apostles, evangelists, and pas-</p>
<p>tors. is argument equates Paul’s phrase about the measure of the gi </p>
<p>with a variety of gis, something Paul does not state here. Paul does not </p>
<p>use the term “gis” (charismata) in either 4:7 or 4:11, as he does in 1 Cor </p>
<p>12:4 or Rom 12:6. In 1 Cor 12:11, however, Paul does describe dier-</p>
<p>ent gis as coming from the one Spirit, dierent ministries from the one </p>
<p>Lord, and dierent activities being worked out by the same God. But in </p>
<p>Eph 4:7, Paul’s point centers on unity, not dierent gis. Each of us, Paul </p>
<p>declares, has grace, because Christ defeated captivity and as victor, can </p>
<p>give gis (plural in the quotation) to his people (4:8–10).</p>
<p>e Romans passage is more dicult to interpret. In Rom 12:6, Paul </p>
<p>speaks of dierent gis being given according to the grace, and in 12:3 </p>
<p>speaks about the “measure of faith.” He begins his argument in 12:3 by </p>
<p>cautioning that each believer should think soberly about themselves, </p>
<p>adding that God has apportioned a measure of faith to each. At a glance </p>
<p>this text might seem parallel to our Ephesians text, so a careful read is in </p>
<p>order. First we ask why people might be tempted to think more highly of </p>
<p>themselves. Did they think that they possessed more virtue or talent or </p>
<p>giing from God? Paul is presumably countering the Romans’ view that </p>
<p>some believers have more of something than do others. us the term </p>
<p>“measure” here probably should be understood as a means or standard </p>
<p>of measurement. Additionally, oen the phrase “of faith” is understood </p>
<p>as a partitive genitive, suggesting that Paul is stressing either a special </p>
miracle-working faith or an individual Christian’s personal faith response
<p>to God. Paul would be saying that some Christians received more of faith </p>
<p>(of some kind) than did others.</p>
<p>is interpretation, however, does not t with Paul’s claim that they </p>
<p>not think more highly of themselves, for if indeed someone did have </p>
<p>more faith, it makes sense that they value that more highly than some-</p>
<p>one who is lacking faith. A better interpretation would be to understand </p>
