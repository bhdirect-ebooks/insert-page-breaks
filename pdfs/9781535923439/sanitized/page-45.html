<p>Ephesus Imprisonment</p>
<p>Looking closely at the arguments for Paul’s imprisonment in Ephesus, </p>
<p>one assertion put forward depends on Onesimus’s runaway status. e </p>
<p>claim is that he would not have had the funds to ee to Rome. is theory </p>
<p>usually alleges that he stole from Philemon, which invites the question of </p>
<p>why Onesimus did not steal enough to get himself as far from Colossae </p>
<p>as possible. Where better to lose oneself than in Rome, a city of a mil-</p>
<p>lion people, as some estimates put Rome’s population in the rst century </p>
<p>CE? A second argument in favor of an Ephesus imprisonment focuses on </p>
<p>accommodating the several visits between Colossae and Paul indicated </p>
<p>by the correspondence. e timeline runs as follows: Onesimus meets </p>
<p>Paul, Paul sends a letter with Onesimus back to Philemon, the latter frees </p>
<p>Onesimus to serve with Paul (who is in prison), and Tychicus is sent with </p>
<p>Onesimus back to Colossae. Travel between Ephesus and Colossae is </p>
<p>about ve days; between Colossae and Rome about two months. us it </p>
<p>would be quite simple for Philemon to send Onesimus to care for Paul in </p>
<p>Ephesus, and for the former to make several trips back to Colossae.</p>
<p>A serious challenge to the Ephesus theory is the lack of evidence for </p>
<p>an Ephesus imprisonment. Acts is silent on this, which in and of itself </p>
<p>does not disqualify the argument. But the positive evidence is likewise </p>
<p>slim. Paul speaks of enduring many imprisonments (2 Cor 11:23), and </p>
<p>specically of facing “wild beasts in Ephesus” (1 Cor 15:32). is latter </p>
<p>phrase is taken as implying some sort of literal incarceration in the city. </p>
<p>Several points, however, caution against drawing this conclusion. First, if </p>
<p>Paul was given over literally to the beasts, he would have been stripped of </p>
<p>his citizenship. However, from Acts it appears that Paul retained his citi-</p>
<p>zenship throughout his ministry. Moreover, the content in 1 Cor 15 has </p>
<p>many connections with the philosophical jargon of the day. Oen philos-</p>
<p>ophers would speak of battling their passions and hedonistic rivals with </p>
<p>language similar to Paul. Paul quotes from the philosopher Menander, </p>
<p>“Bad company corrupts good character” (15:32), which suggests he </p>
<p>is placing his argument in the context of a philosopher’s admonitions. </p>
<p>Moreover, Paul uses the diatribe method, ring o rhetorical questions </p>
<p>to jar the Corinthians back to their senses and act rightly.</p>

<p>is form of</p>
<p>argumentation was common among philosophers.</p>
