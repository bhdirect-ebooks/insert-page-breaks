<p>Paul’s Prayer and Doxology (3:14–21)</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>For this reason I kneel before the Father, </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>from whom ev-</p>
<p>ery family in heaven and on earth derives its name. </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>I pray </p>
<p>that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with </p>
<p>power through his Spirit in your inner being, </p>
<p>17</p>
<p>so that Christ </p>
<p>may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, </p>
<p>being rooted and established in love, </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>may have power, to-</p>
<p>gether with all the Lord’s people, to grasp how wide and long </p>
<p>and high and deep is the love of Christ, </p>
<p>19</p>
<p>and to know this </p>
<p>love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be lled to the </p>
<p>measure of all the fullness of God. </p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Now to him who is able </p>
<p>to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, accord-</p>
<p>ing to his power that is at work within us, </p>
<p>21</p>
<p>to him be glory </p>
<p>in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, </p>
<p>for ever and ever! Amen.</p>
<p>Paul’s digression in 3:1–13 lays the groundwork for his prayer for the </p>
<p>Ephesian church. In this prayer, several concerns that he raises in the </p>
<p>previous verses come into play. His concern for glory, for the church, and </p>
<p>for the power of God to be working in and through them link with his ex-</p>
<p>planation of God’s working in his own life. Paul has shown the Ephesians </p>
<p>in the previous chapters the redemption plan of God enacted in Christ </p>
<p>and sealed by the Spirit. ese amazing realities, however, are not merely </p>
<p>facts to be known for the nal exam that, if passed, gets us into heaven. </p>
<p>Instead, Paul recognizes that these truths must come alive in the church </p>
<p>and in each believer’s heart and mind, thereby providing the energy to be </p>
<p>faithful, to be the church to and for the world. Paul’s prayer swells from a </p>
<p>desire that the Ephesians might experience the reality of God’s fullness in </p>
<p>the redeemed life.</p>
<p>God the Father of All Families (3:14–15)</p>
<p>Paul oers this prayer before he begins his requests for their behavior </p>
<p>changes in 4:1. Oen we reverse the order; we demand change, and then </p>
<p>pray that it happens. Paul’s approach is instructive; it signals that any </p>
<p>hoped for behavior or attitude change has to be rooted in the convictions </p>
