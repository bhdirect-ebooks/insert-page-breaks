<p>Salutation (1:1–2)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to God’s </p>
<p>holy people in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus: </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Grace </p>
<p>and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus </p>
<p>Christ.</p>
<p>Paul identies himself as the only author of the letter. In this Ephesians </p>
<p>is similar to Romans and Galatians. It is a bit curious here, inasmuch as </p>
<p>Timothy is a coauthor in Colossians, Philippians, and Philemon. However, </p>
<p>Ephesians is similar to Romans in that Paul is writing to at least some </p>
<p>people who are unknown personally to him. Paul identies himself as an </p>
<p>apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God; this is the exact same phrase </p>
<p>used in 2 Cor 1:1, but similar language is used generally in Paul’s saluta-</p>
<p>tions. Paul follows normal letter protocol, wherein the sender is identi-</p>
<p>ed at the beginning, as well as the recipients. In Ephesians, they are the </p>
<p>saints or holy ones, also a general moniker used by Paul for those who are </p>
<p>believers. e term “saints” or “holy people” has come to mean only a se-</p>
<p>lect few who have lived exemplary lives and are canonized by the church. </p>
<p>What does it say about Paul’s understanding of the work of the cross that </p>
<p>he would call any believer a saint or holy one? We can say at least that this </p>
<p>is an identity believers share; it is a result of their being in Christ. In 1:4, </p>
<p>the same term is used in conjunction with “blameless” to describe those </p>
<p>who are chosen by God through Jesus Christ. e term “holy ones” is </p>
<p>used in three ways in the New Testament: it describes a spiritual commu-</p>
<p>nity of holy members (1 Cor 6:2), indicates personal sanctication (1 Pet </p>
<p>1:15–16), or, predominantly, distinguishes the local or visible Christian </p>
<p>community made up of believers (Rom 1:7, 15:26, 1 Cor 1:2). In Eph 1:1, </p>
<p>the latter denition seems likely, but 1:4 could arguably suggest personal </p>
sanctication, especially if Paul’s point is individual election (see below).
<p>Again, it may be that 1:4 describes the future of believers, as ones holy and </p>
<p>blameless (see also 5:27). Of course, these ideas are not mutually exclusive </p>
<p>in as much as Paul could imagine that our present status as holy ones </p>
<p>in Christ aects not only our present life but also our life in the age to </p>
<p>come.</p>
<p>e phrase “in Ephesus” which describes the saints is missing in </p>
<p>some important manuscripts, but as discussed in the introduction, a solid </p>
<p>case can be made for their original inclusion. An important caveat is that </p>
