<p>Walking as Christ Walked</p>

<p>Do not get drunk on wine, which </p>
<p>leads to debauchery. Instead, be lled with the Spirit, </p>

<p>speak-</p>
<p>ing to one another with psalms, hymns and songs from the </p>

<p>always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in </p>
<p>the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Paul makes several commands in this section that plunge to the heart of </p>
<p>the Christian life. e guidelines are not simply to do this or avoid that, </p>
<p>but rather Paul instructs believers to become in real time what they are </p>
<p>already in Christ. And unlike some instructions, such as “shut the door,” </p>
<p>that a person can accomplish in one step, Paul’s instructions to “be” or “fol-</p>
<p>low” (same Greek term ginomai, 4:32; 5:1, 7, 17) imply a lifelong process. </p>
<p>Further emphasizing the daily transformational goals of imitating God is </p>
<p>Paul’s repeated call to walk aer Christ. Paul insists that a Christian walk </p>
<p>in love and truth, not foolishness and sin. e secret to this new attitude </p>
<p>is the new person each believer has become. Paul outlined this new life in </p>
<p>ch. 4, and now he insists on holy living because believers are God’s dearly </p>
<p>loved children.</p>
<p>Become Imitators of God (5:1–6)</p>
<p>e audacity of Paul’s statement that believers are to imitate God (TNIV: </p>
<p>“follow God’s example”) leads many to write o this verse as an impossible </p>
<p>goal. But Paul has a specic focus in mind that he thinks is completely </p>
<p>within the believer’s capability. In 4:32, believers are enjoined to forgive </p>
<p>each other as God forgave them in Christ. Paul focuses on this attitude </p>
<p>of forgiveness in his encouragement that believers become imitators of </p>
<p>God. e verb implies continuing behavior repeated so as to become </p>
<p>habit. is sentiment of forgiveness matches the Lord’s Prayer, wherein </p>
<p>Jesus taught his disciples to pray, “Forgive us our debts as we also have </p>
<p>forgiven our debtors” (Matt 6:12). In 1 Cor 4:16, Paul uses the same verb </p>
<p>and noun (become imitators), but there he asks the Corinthians to imitate </p>
<p>him. e context is the Corinthians’ failure to appreciate Paul’s apostolic </p>
<p>authority, and also their disregard of his role as their father in the Lord. </p>
<p>In both cases, the audience is understood as dear and beloved children. </p>
<p>One reason, then, that Paul asks believers in Ephesians to imitate God is </p>
