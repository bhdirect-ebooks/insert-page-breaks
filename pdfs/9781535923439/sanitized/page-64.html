<p>Ephesians 1:7–10</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>no hint that he is defending the necessity of the Christ’s cross, as to the </p>
<p>Corinthians. e truth that God has redeemed us through the blood of </p>
<p>Christ appears to be a common assessment between Paul and his readers. </p>
<p>More dicult to determine is whether Paul understands redemption to </p>
<p>include in this case the idea of payment of ransom. Generally the term </p>
<p>means deliverance, but it can include the sense of paying for release. If </p>
<p>ransom is implicit, then the verse would be interpreted as Christ’s death </p>
<p>being a ransom for our transgressions.</p>
<p>In this section Paul introduces a key term, “mystery.” In Ephesians </p>
<p>this term is tightly tied with the notion of unity in Christ. In 1:10 the </p>
<p>unity is cosmic, namely that both heavenly and earthly things will nally </p>
<p>be united in Christ at the end. But some measure of this mystery has </p>
<p>already been put into eect, namely the unity within the church, the one-</p>
<p>ness in Christ of Jew and Gentile in God’s plan to make a people unto </p>
<p>himself (3:5). It has been claimed that Paul describes mystery with a dif-</p>
<p>ferent nuance in 1 Cor 15:51, and that therefore its use here suggests a </p>
<p>deutero-Pauline author. But two points should be noted. First, “mystery” </p>
<p>as a concept allows for some uidity; it is not a rigid category in Paul’s </p>
<p>time. Second, that said, in both 1 Corinthians and Ephesians, the general </p>
<p>context of “mystery” is similar. In 1 Cor 15:56 Paul notes that the power of </p>
<p>sin is the law—and yet he had not been speaking about Jews and Gentiles </p>
<p>in this chapter, or to any extent throughout the letters, so why note it </p>
<p>here? Because the law served to separate Gentiles from Jews, while Christ </p>
<p>brought the two groups together, through faith. e mystery, for Paul, </p>
<p>is the marvelous act of mercy that redeemed both Jew and Gentile, and </p>
<p>created for God one unied people (2:15). Additionally, this mystery is </p>
<p>now revealed, not hidden. Paul’s understanding of “mystery” has little re-</p>
<p>semblance in this sense, then, to the mystery cults that dotted the Roman </p>
<p>religious landscape.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Rome was both suspicious and sometimes tolerant of</p>
<p>these private groups with their closely guarded initiation rites that prom-</p>
<p>ised life aer death, based on the dying-and-rising savior gure of their </p>
<p>god or goddess. e Isis cult was especially popular, and a marvelously </p>
<p>entertaining work from antiquity describing it has survived: e Golden </p>
<p>Ass or e Metamorphoses by Apuleius. Josephus, the Jewish historian of </p>
<p>the late rst century CE, recounts a fascinating tale of a wealthy Roman </p>
<p>2. For a lengthy discussion on “mystery,” see the chapter on Eph 3.</p>
