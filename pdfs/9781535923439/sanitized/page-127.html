<p>e Gi to Grow On</p>

<p>More likely Paul has in mind the corporate witness of the church in the </p>
<p>world to be the body of Christ, unied in Him.</p>
<p>In 4:13–16, Paul creates a vivid picture contrasting an infant and </p>
<p>an adult. e former is unstable and vulnerable to every dishonorable, </p>
<p>deceitful person seeking an advantage. But the mature are stable because </p>
<p>they are grounded in the truth; they have reached the standard or measure </p>
<p>of Christ’s fullness. e choice of verb is interesting. Paul speaks of our ar-</p>
<p>riving at this mature adult and fullness status, implying a lifelong journey. </p>
<p>e goal is a fully formed and functioning body of Christ with each part </p>
<p>contributing to the health of the whole. In this description Paul tracks </p>
<p>a middle path between two common extremes. First, Paul underscores </p>
<p>the importance of correct doctrine, both in his insistence on having a </p>
<p>proper knowledge of the gospel’s teachings and in his compelling picture </p>
<p>of the immature believer tossed like a rag doll on the winds of every pass-</p>
<p>ing doctrinal fad. Oen today Christians downplay doctrine as a way to </p>
<p>bring unity, but ecumenism gained by such a method is illusory. Paul </p>
<p>emphasizes truth in love, which implies a humble spirit straining aer </p>
<p>Christ. Second, Paul cannot imagine a godly knowledge without practical </p>
<p>witness. Teaching the truth in love is a means to the goal of equipping </p>
<p>saints for ministry. Truth is to be lived out in such a way that the body </p>
<p>of Christ grows bigger as new members are added and each one gains </p>
<p>maturity; grows stronger as each by themselves and together understand </p>
<p>more fully the riches of Christ; and grows steadier as the church stands </p>
<p>rm in the face of struggles.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Refusing to Walk the Walk—So What?</p>
<p>The gift of Christ (4:11) speaks to the theological needs of the congregation. </p>
<p>For Paul, right belief leads to right behavior. Right behavior done repeatedly </p>
<p>leads to strong uniﬁed churches wherein all members develop in their roles </p>
<p>in the body. But what if one behaves badly, or discounts the importance of </p>
<p>unity and peace? What are the ramiﬁcations if we do not walk as beﬁts our </p>
<p>calling? Paul indicates that we are then no better than toddlers at the mercy of </p>
<p>devious people (4:14). We are destined to behave in lewd ways, with darkened </p>
<p>minds (4:17–18). Some today suggest that Paul was not strong enough in </p>
<p>his condemnation of bad behavior, but this fails to appreciate the historical </p>
