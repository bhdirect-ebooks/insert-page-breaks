<p>As crucial as are the participles, the prepositions that introduce </p>
<p>the numerous clauses help govern the meaning and set the cadence of </p>
<p>thought and speech. Both warrant careful attention as Paul expounds on </p>
<p>the purposes of God, demonstrated in his all-surpassing grace that mani-</p>
<p>fests itself in the redemptive work of Christ. For example, the phrases “in </p>
<p>Christ” and “in the Lord” occur frequently. Not to put too ne a point </p>
<p>on it, but in general, Paul uses the term “Christ” when referring to the </p>
<p>crucied and resurrected Messiah, and the term “Lord” in the context of </p>
<p>discussing the functional aspects of a believer’s life as they seek to live out </p>
<p>the reality of their salvation. Paul also uses “in whom” (meaning Christ) </p>
<p>in 1:7, 11, 13, highlighting three special privileges believers enjoy based </p>
<p>on their relationship with Christ. e preposition “in” designates union </p>
<p>rooted in the historical events of the cross and resurrection. e dative </p>
<p>case used here gives the sense of “through” Christ, and also the sense of </p>
<p>location, namely that believers are where Christ also is. Finally the dative </p>
<p>denotes identity, such that just as Paul can speak of those who are “in </p>
<p>Adam” or “in Abraham” so too believers are in Christ; we share a particu-</p>
lar identity as a group in which each individual also bears this identity.
<p>e section 1:4–6 forms a sub-unit of thought, explaining why it </p>
<p>is that God could be so richly described in 1:3. en 1:7–10 develops </p>
<p>the mystery of Christ’s redemption work, leading to 1:11–14, which ex-</p>
<p>plicates what that life in Christ is to the believer. Certain key terms and </p>
<p>phrases connect these three units. For example, in 1:4, 12 the verb “to </p>
<p>be” in the innitive is used with similar purpose. In the former verse, </p>
<p>God’s choosing us in Christ was to make us holy and blameless. In the </p>
<p>latter verse, God’s will was that we be for the praise of his glory, the goal </p>
<p>to which God’s work in Christ (1:4) naturally leads. Additionally, Paul </p>
<p>provides bridges of key terms or concepts between the sub-units to help </p>
<p>guide the reader. For instance, in 1:4 he notes God’s plan that believers are </p>
<p>to be in Christ was established before the foundations of the world, and in </p>
<p>1:5 he writes similarly that God predestined us to be in Christ. e same </p>
<p>verb translated “predestined” in 1:5 is used in the passive tense in 1:11, </p>
<p>further emphasizing God’s choice in creating a people holy and blameless. </p>
<p>He uses words that carry the prex eu which stresses blessings. As we </p>
<p>noted above, 1:3 uses this word family three times, and in 1:5, 9 we nd </p>
<p>the phrase “according to his good pleasure.” And propelling the argument </p>
<p>along are his many prepositions, including the numerous occurrences of </p>
<p>eis, which introduces a clause indicating intention. When Paul writes in </p>
