gospel spoke strongly against slavery, while the letter of certain individual
<p>passages might admit to its practice. In this they diered from the proslav-</p>
<p>ery position, which believed it came to the Bible with no preconceptions, </p>
<p>preferences, or biases. e proslavery proponents urged folks to read the </p>
<p>Bible on their own and make up their own minds. If another came to </p>
<p>persuade you otherwise, ask them questions about other doctrines. ey </p>
<p>were sure to be unorthodox in other areas, which indicated they did not </p>
hold the Bible in highest esteem. e stress on individualism, common
<p>sense, and practical theology were rooted in part in the American ex-</p>
<p>perience of democracy and capitalism. us was established an either/</p>
<p>or argument that gave the false choice of accepting slavery and biblical </p>
<p>authority, or dismissing both. e preacher J. W. Tucker said to his con-</p>
<p>federate audience in 1862 that “your cause is the cause of God, the cause </p>
<p>of Christ, of humanity. It is a conict of truth with error—of Bible with </p>
<p>Northern indelity—of pure Christianity with Northern fanaticism.”</p>

<p>e proslavery group believed that they read the Bible without </p>
<p>preconceptions but in a common sense manner. Slavery seemed com-</p>
<p>monsensical because of the underlying belief that the black was inferior. </p>
<p>However, even white abolitionists had trouble seeing the black person as </p>
<p>fully and equally a brother. Ironically, the black man’s inferiority was not </p>
<p>argued from the Bible (aside from the distortion of Gen 9:22, 25, which </p>
<p>posited a “curse” of black skin color on Ham</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>) but from experience.</p>

<p>Sadly, proslavery proponents did not recognize their hermeneutical shi, </p>
<p>maintaining instead that all evidence for their conclusions came di-</p>
<p>rectly from Scripture, even statements such as the following by James H. </p>
<p>ornwell: “as long as that race, in its comparative degradation, co-exists </p>
<p>side by side with the whites, bondage is its normal condition.”</p>

<p>Later in</p>
<p>the same address, he continued that Africans were at the bottom of the </p>
<p>social ladder because of their level of aptitude and culture, and “people </p>
<p>are distributed into classes, according to their competency and progress. </p>
