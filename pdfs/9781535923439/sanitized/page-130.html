<p>Ephesians 4:17–32</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>Paul insists in 4:20–21 that the Ephesians learned Christ; they were </p>
<p>taught truth in Jesus. He follows this statement with three innitives </p>
<p>which all relate back to the verb “were taught.” e rst and last inni-</p>
<p>tive, “to put o” and “to put on,” are in the past (aorist) tense, while the </p>
<p>second innitive “to be made new” is in the present tense. e primary </p>
<p>questions revolve around how to translate these innitives, especially the </p>
<p>rst and last ones. Do they describe the result of the teaching? If so, then </p>
<p>Paul would be emphasizing the previous facts that believers have shed </p>
<p>their old self and put on their new self in Christ. Or do they indicate </p>
<p>the purpose of the teaching? In this case, the innitives would serve as </p>
<p>imperatives encouraging believers to act by taking o the old person and </p>
<p>putting on the new person. For answers to this dilemma, we look to other </p>
<p>places in Paul’s letters where he uses similar language. e closest parallel </p>
<p>is Col 3:9–10, which includes the participles “put o” and “put on” in </p>
<p>past tense, along with the present participle “made new” or “renewing.” </p>
<p>e new person is that wonderful creation in Christ which does not allow </p>
<p>categorization by old ways—Jew, Gentile, slave, free, etc. All are in Christ </p>
<p>(3:11). A second example is Rom 6:2–8, where Paul makes clear that in </p>
<p>baptism the believer dies to his or her old self, and is raised to new life </p>
<p>(see also Gal 3:27). e old self no longer has power because the old age </p>
<p>to which it belongs is passing away. us believers need no longer heed its </p>
<p>siren calls to sin, for even sin’s power has been broken; believers are now </p>
<p>slaves of righteousness. From these examples, many rightly conclude that </p>
<p>Paul in Eph 4:20–24 intends that believers have shed their old self and put </p>
<p>on their new self already, perhaps in their baptism.</p>
<p>However, Paul also uses the language of putting o and putting on </p>
<p>in his injunctions to live a new life. In Rom 13:12, 14 Paul encourages </p>
<p>the Romans to put on the armor of light. Additionally, in Eph 4:23 Paul </p>
<p>speaks in the present tense of believers being renewed by the Spirit or </p>
<p>spirit (“attitude” in TNIV) of their minds. is suggests a daily, ongoing </p>
<p>commitment to act in a manner pleasing to God, which invites comment </p>
on Paul’s view of human and divine agency. Christians down through the centuries have debated the interrelationship between divine and hu-
<p>man agency. A question oen asked is whether humans have free will </p>
<p>to do God’s will. Paul holds a strict dualism between light and darkness, </p>
<p>truth and falsehood. He maintains that a person is either a slave of sin </p>
or a slave of righteousness (Rom 6:17–18). is division seems to run
<p>straight through a believer’s heart inasmuch as the attraction to sin is still </p>
