<p>Introduction</p>

<p>Relationship to Colossians</p>
<p>Not only are the literary character, the words chosen (or omitted), and </p>
<p>the grammatical forms alleged to be outside Paul’s expressive range, but </p>
<p>the letter’s similarity to Colossians raises red ags for many who believe </p>
<p>the latter served as a model for the former. e argument concludes that </p>
<p>Colossians as well as other letters of Paul was used in composing Ephesians. </p>
<p>Both include a similar overall pattern and the household codes, both stress </p>
<p>redemption, body, mystery, and power in similar ways, and both include </p>
<p>exact parallel descriptions of Tychicus’ instructions in delivering the let-</p>
<p>ter. But these observations need not rule out Pauline authorship, for an </p>
<p>examination of the data suggests that many of the similar terms include </p>
<p>common prepositions, pronouns, and the words God and Christ. Again, </p>
<p>scribes oen made copies of their letters, in case the rst was inadvertently </p>
<p>destroyed or failed to make its destination. For example, Cicero remarks </p>
<p>that his letter to Julius Caesar was ruined because the carrier managed to </p>
<p>get it wet and the ink ran. But all was not lost, because Cicero had a copy </p>
<p>of the letter, and so he re-sent it.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> It was common to keep copies</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>to share letters with friends, as does Cicero when he sends a copy of his </p>
<p>letter to Pompey to Atticus.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> It was assumed that people shared their let-</p>
<p>ters, such that Cicero’s friend Curius specically asks Cicero not to show </p>
<p>this particular letter to anyone.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>And Cicero, Atticus, and others saved</p>
<p>copies of what they wrote to use the text in other, similar circumstances. </p>
<p>At one point Cicero blushes at this practice, for he admits that he used the </p>
<p>same preface in two works. He claries that he was not paying attention </p>
<p>when he sent the work in question to his friend Atticus, and it was only </p>
<p>a bit later when he was reading another work that he saw it had the same </p>
<p>preface. He explains that he keeps a volume of his prefaces from which he </p>
<p>chooses suitable beginnings for his projects. In this case he was writing a </p>
<p>new preface, and requests that Atticus cut out the old preface and glue the </p>
<p>new one in place.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>us if Paul wrote Ephesians and Colossians within the same basic </p>
<p>time frame, which ts with the note that Tychicus delivered both letters, </p>
