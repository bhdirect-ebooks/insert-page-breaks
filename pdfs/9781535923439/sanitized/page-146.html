<p>Prolegomena to the Household Codes</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>Benefaction and Reciprocity</p>
<p>In sum, society was highly stratiﬁed, and one’s place on the social hierarchy </p>
<p>had political and economic repercussions. This basic understanding of so-</p>
<p>ciety characterized Paul’s day, and the honor/shame code permeated both </p>
<p>the Jewish and the Gentile communities. The ordering of society into status </p>
<p>levels and rank were supported by an ontological assessment of the nature </p>
<p>of each person and group, based largely on Aristotle’s conclusions, although </p>
<p>the Jews’ assessment about what was honorable was shaped as well by the </p>
<p>Old Testament. This stratiﬁed culture supported a second important social </p>
<p>construct, that of benefaction. Essentially, benefaction is the giving of gifts. It </p>
<p>requires reciprocity, such that one who gives the gift has placed the receiver </p>
<p>in their debt. The patron or gift giver must be honored for his beneﬁcence by </p>
<p>the client or recipient. If possible, the client should repay the patron ﬁnan-</p>
<p>cially, but often that was impossible as the client was poorer than the patron. </p>
<p>This meant that the client was beholden to the patron, and was expected to </p>
<p>publicly praise and offer tribute to their patron. This system of reciprocity is </p>
<p>especially important when we consider the household codes, because most </p>
<p>thinkers in Paul’s day assumed that a wife, child, or slave could not beneﬁt </p>
<p>their husband, father, or master, for that would alter the asymmetrical rela-</p>
<p>tionship. Instead, any aid done by wife or child was understood as their duty, </p>
<p>while any such deed done by the slave was his or her service to the owner.</p>
<p>We see the system of reciprocity sketched out in Seneca,</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> a ﬁrst-cen-</p>
<p>tury CE Stoic philosopher. He discusses the order of society as it relates to </p>
<p>receiving beneﬁts, noting that most believe that only a stranger can give a </p>
<p>beneﬁt, because only a stranger is able to discontinue beneﬁts without blame. </p>
<p>This is contrasted with wives and children, whose duties to their husbands or </p>
<p>fathers are inherent in the relationship, and slaves, whose relationship with </p>
<p>their masters is such that no deed could ever be considered a gift that would </p>
<p>put the master in their debt. Seneca argues against this assumption by noting </p>
<p>that some slaves give their lives to protect their masters; clearly this is above </p>
<p>the duty of a slave, and thus is a gift. Moreover, Seneca argues that while the </p>
<p>slave’s body is caged, the mind is free to follow virtue.</p>
<p>Yet even with this sound critique, neither Seneca nor other philosophers </p>
<p>attacked the institution itself. The conditions of slavery were debated by some </p>
<p>philosophers because they knew that at least some slaves were not born into </p>
