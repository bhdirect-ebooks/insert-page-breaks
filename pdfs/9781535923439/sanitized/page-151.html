<p>Wives and Husbands Addressed</p>

<p>while the middle implies some agency. is latter sense is preferred, as </p>
<p>it matches the other active participles’ voice and it ts Paul’s point that </p>
<p>believers should not act as though drunk (passively under the inuence of </p>
<p>another source) but actively make choices following the Spirit’s leading.</p>
<p>A second key term is “head,” a metaphor used here to describe the </p>
<p>husband and Christ.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>e metaphor aligns the wife with “body,” although</p>
<p>this is not stated directly. e metaphorical use of both “head” and “body” </p>
<p>have been used earlier in Ephesians, always with “head” referring to Christ </p>
<p>and “body” to the church (1:22–23, 4:15–16). Because we have become so </p>
<p>accustomed to hearing this language, it loses its vibrant force, but when </p>
<p>Paul wrote, he chose these words to create new meaning by linking two </p>
<p>concepts that had not been connected before in people’s imaginations. </p>
<p>Today we oen read “head” and in our minds substitute “leader” because </p>
<p>that is how the metaphor is used in English; indeed one could argue that </p>
<p>today “head” has ceased to be a metaphor. But in Paul’s day, this metaphor </p>
<p>was not a xed symbol with a literal meaning. Paul’s thrust took its power </p>
<p>from connecting two dierent ideas (such as husband and wife) via the </p>
<p>metaphors of “head” and “body” to create a new argument. Paul uses the </p>
<p>literal subjects of Christ, wife, and husband as the frame, together with </p>
<p>the non-literal meanings of “head” and “body,” to create his dynamic met-</p>
<p>aphor expounding upon unity. We should resist the temptation to assume </p>
<p>that a metaphor can be easily replaced by an equivalent literal expression, </p>
<p>for an intrinsic part of the metaphor is its creative punch, its ability to </p>
<p>excite the imagination and extend the boundaries of possibilities.</p>
<p>Paul’s focus in using this metaphor can be understood in two ways. </p>
<p>Either Paul is interested in ethical injunctions or in describing the ana-</p>
<p>logical relationship between marriage and Christ and the church. e </p>
<p>two are not mutually exclusive, but the second makes better sense of the </p>
<p>curious phrase that Christ is the Savior of the body (5:23). is phrase </p>
<p>clearly distinguishes Christ’s headship from the husband’s headship, thus </p>
<p>narrowing the application of the latter.</p>
<p>Why use body imagery here? When we glance back at the use of </p>
<p>“head” in 1:22–23, we nd that “head” and “feet” create a vivid picture of </p>
<p>Christ’s surpassing glory and dominion over all forces. e term “head” </p>
<p>is used here as the complement to “feet”; the image of the vanquished at </p>
<p>the conqueror’s feet is a common one, readily apprehended. A second </p>
