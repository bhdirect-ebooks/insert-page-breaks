<p>Prolegomena to the Household Codes</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>A distinctive of an honor/shame culture is its assumption that honor </p>
<p>is a limited good, and thus should be contested. The ancient honor/shame </p>
<p>culture was a zero-sum game inasmuch as one gained honor while another </p>
<p>was shamed. This aspect of the culture is known as the challenge-riposte, and </p>
<p>it involved a challenge being leveled to which the other needed to respond. </p>
<p>Failure to meet the test adequately brought shame, but a superior response </p>
<p>disgraced the challenger, who might extend another challenge to regain lost </p>
<p>honor. Additionally, any dishonorable misdeeds by wives, children, or slaves </p>
<p>brought shame to the husband, parents, or owners. No one stood on their own </p>
<p>merits entirely, but could be brought low by their relations. For example, a </p>
<p>child’s failure to be courageous or intelligent plagued the parents whose fam-</p>
<p>ily honor depended upon their child fulﬁlling expectations.</p>
<p>The poignant story of the rape of Lucretia is saturated with the ideals of </p>
<p>honor/shame. In this tale about the political overthrow of ancient Rome’s king </p>
<p>and the establishment of Roman republican government, we ﬁnd several young </p>
<p>men from leading families and princes boasting about the chasteness of their </p>
<p>wives. They decide to prove to each other the respectability of their own wives </p>
<p>by leaving the besieged city to check on them. It is late in the evening, and all </p>
<p>the wives but one are preparing for a banquet (nothing speciﬁcally immoral is </p>
<p>suggested). Only one wife, Lucretia, is still busy working, spinning wool in her </p>
<p>home. Her industry brought much honor to her husband, Collantinus, but it </p>
<p>shamed the other men. Angry at being shamed, one of these princes, Sextus </p>
<p>Tarquinius, returned to the house a few nights later and raped her. The next </p>
<p>morning, she sent word to her father and husband, who returned with a few </p>
<p>friends. They believed her recounting of the story, but she feared that other </p>
<p>women in the future might use her name to justify an extramarital affair. To </p>
<p>end all possible doubt as to her innocence, she committed suicide. Her death </p>
<p>was avenged with the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the </p>
<p>Roman Republic. Two pulses of this story continued to pound in Paul’s day: </p>
<p>the fear of monarchical rule and the importance of women working in their </p>
<p>homes. Thus the ﬁrst Emperor, Augustus, was at pains to present himself not </p>
<p>as a supreme ruler but as a traditionalist who acceded to the wishes of the </p>
<p>Senate. He spoke of his wife, Livia, as one who worked with wool and made </p>
<p>his clothes. Neither of these presentations reﬂected the actual situation, but </p>
<p>the values Augustus expressed were driven deep into the culture of his day.</p>
