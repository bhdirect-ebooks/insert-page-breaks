<p>Paul, a Prisoner in Chains</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God’s holy apos-</p>
<p>tles and prophets. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>is mystery is that through the gospel </p>
<p>the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together </p>
<p>of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ </p>
<p>Jesus. </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>I became a servant of this gospel by the gi of God’s </p>
<p>grace given me through the working of his power. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Although </p>
<p>I am less than the least of all the Lord’s people, this grace was </p>
<p>given me: to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of </p>
<p>Christ, </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>and to make plain to everyone the administration </p>
<p>of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, </p>
<p>who created all things. </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>His intent was that now, through </p>
<p>the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made </p>
<p>known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms, </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>according to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in </p>
<p>Christ Jesus our Lord. </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>In him and through faith in him we </p>
<p>may approach God with freedom and condence. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>I ask you, </p>
<p>therefore, not to be discouraged because of my suerings for </p>
<p>you, which are your glory.</p>
<p>Paul’s Rhetorical Strategy</p>
<p>Paul’s self-description here in the rst half of chapter 3 can be under-</p>
<p>stood as a digression from his argument in 2:22 which he then picks up </p>
<p>again in 3:14. If 3:1–13 were missing, Paul’s argument would ow nicely </p>
<p>from his mention of Gentiles being members of God’s household (2:19) </p>
<p>to his prayer to the Father from whom every family takes its name (3:14). </p>
<p>Aer declaring that Gentiles and Jews are being built together into God’s </p>
<p>dwelling place (2:22), his prayer that Christ would dwell in their hearts </p>
<p>follows naturally (3:17). An obvious question to raise, then, is why Paul </p>
<p>included 3:1–13. For the answer, it seems best to turn to the ancient </p>
<p>modes of rhetoric, the art of persuasion. Although rhetoric today carries </p>
<p>negative connotations, in Paul’s time it suggested the educated speech of </p>
<p>one who sought to convince his audience of the right decision, attitude, </p>
<p>or behavior. Orators sought to connect with their audience as part of the </p>
<p>persuasive task, realizing that sometimes logic alone would not gener-</p>
<p>ate sucient passion within the audience for the requested tasks. A di-</p>
<p>gression might serve such a function, as well as introduce pertinent and </p>
