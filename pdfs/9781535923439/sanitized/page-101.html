<p>e Mystery of Christ</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>mystery previously hidden but now made manifest through the prophetic </p>
<p>scriptures. is doxological setting is similar to Eph 1:9. Both passages in </p>
<p>Romans stress God’s work through Christ to the Gentiles. Colossians 1:27 </p>
<p>likewise stresses the important of Gentile inclusion in God’s household, </p>
<p>while 2:2 identies the mystery as Christ himself, who contains all wis-</p>
<p>dom and knowledge. is aspect of the term “mystery” is similar to Paul’s </p>
<p>discussion in 1 Cor 2:7, where Paul describes God’s wisdom as a mystery. </p>
<p>e content of God’s wisdom was explained in the previous chapter as </p>
<p>the cross of Christ and its power to save. Paul continues that the wisdom </p>
<p>found in Christ is that which redeems and sancties (1 Cor 1:30). Further </p>
<p>in 1 Corinthians the term “mystery” carries an eschatological sense, as </p>
<p>he notes the mystery of the second coming when all believers will be </p>
<p>changed (1 Cor 15:51). While the nuances of each letter shape Paul’s spe-</p>
<p>cic meaning of “mystery,” overall the term carries the sense that God’s </p>
<p>work in Christ, now revealed in the gospel message, promotes the full </p>
<p>inclusion of Gentiles into God’s household. Elsewhere Paul focuses more </p>
<p>on Christ’s work of redemption, which stresses both Israel and Gentiles; </p>
<p>in Ephesians, the spotlight shines on the reality of Gentile joined with Jew </p>
<p>in Christ’s body.</p>
<p>Paul declares that the mystery of God was previously hidden, but is </p>
<p>now revealed. He states that people in the past did not know this mystery, </p>
<p>and by this he does not mean that they were ignorant of God or his will. </p>
<p>God’s revelation in the Law and through the prophets, promises, and cov-</p>
<p>enants all stand as a testimony to the believer (1 Cor 10:6; Rom 9:4–5). </p>
<p>Paul intends here a very specic claim, namely that God’s work to redeem </p>
<p>Gentiles as Gentiles and not as proselytes to Judaism is the mysterious, </p>
<p>glorious, unexpected aspect of God’s redemptive plan. Rather than wait </p>
<p>for the eschaton to bring believing Gentiles (God-fearers like Cornelius, </p>
<p>Acts 10:1–3, 47) into the fold, God in Christ has brought redemption in </p>
<p>the present age. is greatest work of grace was not revealed fully to the </p>
<p>faithful of Israel in the past, although what was revealed is instructive for </p>
<p>the church (Rom 15:4). But now the apostles and prophets of the church </p>
<p>testify to God’s redeeming grace in Christ. ey did not invent the mes-</p>
<p>sage rather it was given by the Spirit through revelation (3:5).</p>
