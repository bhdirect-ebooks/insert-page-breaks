<p>foot between the two latter cities. Hence a Roman imprisonment seems </p>
<p>the most likely provenance for the letter to the Ephesians.</p>
<p>Date of Ephesians</p>
<p>Assuming Paul wrote from Rome, we can then date the letter to the early </p>
<p>60s CE. e rst letter he wrote would be to Philemon. is might have </p>
<p>been written within a few months of his arrival at Rome. Aer Onesimus </p>
<p>returned to Rome (which might take as little as two and a half months), </p>
<p>Paul set about writing to the Colossians and the Ephesians. We might </p>
<p>suggest that Paul wrote these in late 60 or early 61. is date takes into </p>
<p>account the earthquake that hit nearby Laodicea. Tacitus explains that, </p>
<p>though it was devastated, Laodicea rebuilt quickly and without Rome’s -</p>
<p>nancial assistance. Because no mention of such a natural disaster is noted </p>
<p>by Paul, many argue Colossians could not have been written aer the </p>
<p>tragedy. Alternatively, since we do not have Paul’s letter to the Laodiceans, </p>
<p>we have no way of knowing whether Paul was writing to encourage the </p>
<p>church as they faced the catastrophe. However, Paul made no mention of </p>
<p>the expulsion of Jews from Rome under Claudius in his later letter to the </p>
<p>Romans, so we need not assume that major social or natural upheavals </p>
<p>would be so noted in Paul’s letters. Arguably he might have considered </p>
<p>such a note redundant or obvious. us, while a date in early 61 would </p>
<p>work, it is unclear whether we should accommodate the date of the earth-</p>
<p>quake when determining the writing of Colossians and Ephesians. And </p>
<p>while these movements are taking place, Paul is also communicating with </p>
<p>the Philippian church, with Epaphroditus serving as their envoy convey-</p>
<p>ing aid and service to Paul.</p>
<p>Audience of Ephesians</p>
<p>A major hurdle in describing the community (or communities) receiv-</p>
<p>ing this letter is that the church described is universal. Moreover, if we </p>
<p>take Ephesians as an encyclical letter, we are le to surmise which satellite </p>
<p>towns received the letter. While I argue that Ephesus is the most likely </p>
<p>target for the letter, the possibility of several outlying churches receiving </p>
<p>it is quite strong. In either case, the fact that Paul speaks of the church not </p>
<p>as a local body but in its universal dimensions means that we must look </p>
<p>to topics in the letter which pertain to the general social world in recon-</p>
