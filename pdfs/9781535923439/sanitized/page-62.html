<p>Ephesians 1:4–6</p>

<p>a purpose, namely that we would be holy and blameless. Does Paul intend </p>
<p>here a moral or a forensic meaning? While the term “holy ones” in 1:1 </p>
<p>carries the latter meaning—the believers are holy in Christ (see also Col </p>
<p>1:22)—in 1:4 a strong case can be made that holiness and blamelessness </p>
<p>are the character traits that Christians should exhibit, to God’s glory. Paul </p>
<p>stresses this to the essalonians (1 ess 4:3, 8) in his call that they heed </p>
<p>the will of God, which is their holiness (sanctication). Additionally, in </p>
<p>Phil 2:15 Paul exhorts the Philippians to behavior that is blameless and </p>
<p>pure, for in so doing they will shine like stars amidst the ink-black night, </p>
<p>the corrupt evil age. Paul’s sentiment is similar to Christ’s words in the </p>
<p>Sermon on the Mount (Matt 5:48) that his followers should be perfect </p>
<p>even as his Father is perfect.</p>
<p>To what end this pursuit of the moral life? Paul cautions in his ex-</p>
<p>hortations to the Ephesians to avoid sexual immorality, greediness, and </p>
<p>corrupt language. He then warns that the impure and immoral person </p>
<p>has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God (5:5). One reason, </p>
<p>then, to pursue the moral life is that it will match behavior tting for life </p>
<p>in God’s kingdom. A second reason follows from the rst: Paul repeatedly </p>
<p>refers to the age to come when all things will be under Christ’s dominion, </p>
<p>and evil will be no more. ose who are in Christ have shed the clothing </p>
<p>of the old age (4:22–24) and put on their new self, which is in Christ. A </p>
<p>moral life testies to the change, for one is no longer enslaved to the pres-</p>
<p>ent evil age, but is freed to live the life purposed by the loving God. None </p>
<p>of these good deeds tips the heavenly scales (if there is such a thing!), </p>
<p>but Paul’s point is that something real does happen when the Spirit lives </p>
<p>within a believer. at change from darkness to light should be evident </p>
<p>in choices made for holiness and love. e new creation inaugurated by </p>
<p>Christ’s death and resurrection signals the ultimate fall of the present age, </p>
<p>as well as each believer’s new life, and the church’s existence as witness to </p>
<p>the new thing God is doing in his plan to bring to completion the new </p>
<p>heavens and new earth.</p>
<p>Finally, the question of why moral behavior is important is answered </p>
<p>in Paul’s vision of the church as the temple of the Lord. Not only are in-</p>
dividual believers called to live holy lives, but as God’s people, the church
<p>is being built as the dwelling of God’s Spirit (2:19–22). e call to moral </p>
<p>goodness in Christ, then, is not simply an add-on option for the Christian, </p>
<p>although frequently believers have trouble explaining why their deeds </p>
<p>matter. But that is oen because they lack a comprehensive understand-</p>
