<p>Introduction</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>sized. First, Origen was well aware of the Greek style and grammar of the </p>
<p>Pauline corpus, and was comfortable discussing questions of authenticity </p>
<p>based on that data. Second, Origen does not say anything similar about </p>
<p>the disputed Pauline epistles as he does about Hebrews. at is, he does </p>
<p>not oer that the style, grammar, or theology of any of the Pauline letters </p>
<p>might have been that of a disciple of Paul who used Paul’s name to extend </p>
<p>Paul’s thought for a new day or situation.</p>
<p>A related issue is that of apostolic authority. Paul insists that his ap-</p>
<p>ostolic authority is of a special type: it is directly from God (Gal 1:1). </p>
<p>We have no evidence that Paul seconded that authority to his coworkers; </p>
<p>indeed, that would not be possible, for only God could appoint apostles (1 </p>
<p>Cor 12:4, 28). And the early church also regarded the era of the apostles, </p>
and the apostles themselves, as divinely commissioned to communicate
<p>the word of God. Yet Hebrews shows that authoritative material need not </p>
<p>have within its text the name of an apostle (the canonical Gospels are </p>
<p>another example; the author’s name is found in the title page). What does </p>
<p>seem o limits is assuming apostolic authority without having been given </p>
<p>that responsibility by God.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In closing, I justify the time spent reviewing the evidence concerning </p>
<p>pseudonymity in the Greco-Roman world and early church because the </p>
<p>issue is oen treated as a fait accompli: the Ephesians letter is pseudepi-</p>
<p>graphic, but not deceptive both because the early church accepted the </p>
<p>wider conventions of pseudonymity, and because the ancients had little </p>
<p>sense of intellectual property. is survey has cautioned against accept-</p>
<p>ing these claims. Instead, the evidence suggests the church did not accept </p>
<p>(knowingly) pseudepigraphic letters or works. If Ephesians is determined </p>
<p>to be pseudepigraphic, then the use of Paul’s name and personal data were </p>
<p>included in an eort to pass o the letter as genuine. In that case, it was an </p>
<p>attempt, in the end successful, to deceive the audience.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>is conclusion</p>
<p>must then be processed with issues of canon (a dicult subject in its own </p>
<p>right) and of apostolic authority.</p>
<p>40. Brevard Childs (1994: 52) argues, however, that the authority of the biblical text </p>
<p>comes from its status as canon, not its authorship.</p>
