<p>Paul’s Prayer</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>within the Ephesian community. e basis of growth in the Christian </p>
<p>life is to understand who God is and who we are in Christ. us Paul </p>
<p>asks rst that God will grant a spirit of wisdom and revelation that opens </p>
<p>believers’ awareness to the great things of God. We know God because </p>
<p>God chooses to reveal himself. In 1:18, we nd a participial phrase stating </p>
<p>that the eyes of their hearts have been enlightened. is phrase can be </p>
<p>understood in two ways, either as part of Paul’s request or as a statement </p>
<p>of the Ephesians’ current condition in Christ. e latter option is better in </p>
<p>as much as it takes into account the tense (perfect passive), and connects </p>
<p>the “you” in 1:17 with the “you” in 1:18 by reminding them that they have </p>
<p>already been equipped and prepared to receive God’s wisdom because </p>
<p>their hearts were ooded with God’s light. As believers, Paul notes that </p>
<p>already our hearts have been enlightened, so that God is able to further </p>
<p>lead us in the discovery of his greatness.</p>
<p>Paul includes three requests: that they might know the hope of their </p>
<p>calling, might appreciate their inheritance, and might recognize the power </p>
<p>that makes the rst two a reality. Paul will expand upon the idea of call-</p>
<p>ing at the beginning of ch. 4, but we can note here that his calling oers </p>
<p>future promise. We are called but have yet to achieve all that is part of that </p>
<p>calling; hence we assume a posture of hope. Likewise, Paul asks that our </p>
<p>knowledge of God be further developed in light of his inheritance in the </p>
<p>saints. e possessive pronoun gives pause here: Is Paul stating that God’s </p>
<p>own inheritance is that he has saints in Christ? Or is the genitive indicat-</p>
<p>ing that God’s inheritance is given to the saints? In favor of the latter is </p>
<p>1:14, which notes that the Spirit is our seal, securing our inheritance in </p>
<p>Christ. But 1:11 states that believers are God’s inheritance in Christ, and </p>
<p>1:18 might be continuing that thought, namely that the saints would have </p>
<p>their minds opened to the amazing truth that the church is God’s pos-</p>
<p>session. Finally, Paul asks that God would reveal his tremendous power, </p>
<p>which not only raised Christ from the dead, but works also on our behalf </p>
<p>as believers. Before we examine more closely Paul’s description of God’s </p>
<p>power in Christ’s resurrection and the tectonic shi in spiritual powers </p>
<p>that ensued, we might pause to reect on the characterization of believers </p>
<p>thus far. e saints have faith in Christ and love for the saints. eir faith </p>
<p>in the Lord Jesus is not simply a nod to God’s activity in Christ’s death </p>
<p>and resurrection. e events create a community of faith, a community </p>
<p>distinguished by love. Even as in 1:4 the believers are chosen to be holy </p>
