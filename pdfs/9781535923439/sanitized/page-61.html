<p>Chosen through Christ</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>the promised inheritance or sonship, and are destined to become in the </p>
<p>image of the Son. e Greek text in Rom 8:28 allows for this latter pos-</p>
<p>sibility, in that it reads “according to purpose” (the pronoun “his” does </p>
<p>not appear in the Greek in this verse), which means that God calls all, </p>
<p>but not all respond. e point here might be that Paul is assuring the </p>
<p>believers (the ones loving God in 8:28) that God in his foreknowledge </p>
<p>knew who would choose him, and prepared their sonship. He predes-</p>
<p>tined them to be conformed to the image of the Son—their goal is sure </p>
<p>and their means to achieve it as well. In the context of Eph 1:5, 11, the </p>
<p>ow of Paul’s argument is to praise God for his work through Christ to </p>
<p>make a holy and blameless people, ones predestined to sonship, for the </p>
<p>praise of his glory (1:5–6), and this was accomplished by the blood of </p>
<p>Christ, which results in the forgiveness of sins and the summing up of all </p>
<p>things in Christ (1:7–10). In 1:11 he links “predestined” with the argu-</p>
<p>ment that God has planned for “us” (likely meaning believers generally) </p>
<p>to be for God’s praise and glory. When Paul uses “predestined” he con-</p>
<p>nects it with inheritance; when he speaks of redemption, he argues the </p>
<p>ecacy of Christ’s blood for the forgiveness of sins. Without putting too </p>
<p>ne a point on it, the evidence here leans towards seeing “predestined” as </p>
<p>connected with God accomplishing his goal of making a people holy to </p>
<p>himself, which includes but is not limited to the salvation or election of </p>
particular individuals. Paul speaks about God’s character which manifests
<p>itself in actions that take the initiative with humans.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>With his emphasis on</p>
<p>choosing and predestining, Paul follows the pattern laid down in the Old </p>
<p>Testament. e Law and the Prophets make clear that God elected Israel </p>
<p>not for any particular intrinsic quality on their part, but based on God’s </p>
<p>good pleasure. God chose Abraham, Jacob, David, and a host of other g-</p>
<p>ures to witness to and extend his work and his mercy. God also chose the </p>
<p>people Israel to be his holy people. Peter likewise speaks of believers as </p>
<p>a chosen people, and continues in describing them as a royal priesthood </p>
<p>and a holy nation—language taken from core Jewish convictions about </p>
<p>God’s actions in bringing about a people of his Name (1 Pet 2:9). For the </p>
<p>earliest Jewish believers in Jesus, then, the notion of chosenness had deep </p>
<p>roots in God’s revelation to ancient Israel. Paul explains God chose us for </p>
<p>1. Paul speaks of the Corinthian believers being chosen by God; here the emphasis is </p>
<p>on God’s choice of those who are unimpressive in the world’s estimation. God acted in </p>
<p>this manner so that his wisdom would be known and no person could boast before him </p>
<p>(1 Cor 1:26–31).</p>
