<p>relevant information that, while not necessarily logically related to the </p>
<p>specic argument, would advance the overall agenda. Quintilian notes </p>
<p>that a digression highlights a relevant theme important to the overall case </p>
<p>being discussed.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> Moreover, the digression is usually in the form of epide-</p>
<p>ictic rhetoric, that is, it concerns praise or blame. ese characteristics are </p>
<p>found in Paul’s digression.</p>
<p>Paul’s strategy of using a digression is rooted in his choice of argu-</p>
<p>ment style. Typically the rhetor would begin with a prologue (exordium), </p>
<p>next oer a report of the situation, oen with a historical glance backwards </p>
<p>(narratio), then provide the logical argument of his case (argumentatio), </p>
<p>and conclude with a summary of the argument that also sought to recon-</p>
<p>nect with the audience (peroratio). Usually the argument is based on the </p>
<p>preceding explanation of the situation, and includes the consequences of </p>
<p>following (or not) the line of reasoning. However, Paul does not threaten </p>
<p>the Ephesians with dire consequences if they fail to live holy lives or </p>
<p>promise great reward if they do. Rather, he exhorts and encourages them </p>
<p>to walk worthy of who they are in Christ. us we might conclude that </p>
<p>rather than using the argumentatio, Paul employs the rhetorical category </p>
<p>of exhortatio in chapters 4–6. With this strategy, Paul seeks to persuade </p>
<p>the Ephesians of the truth of his ideas and the reality of its relevance </p>
<p>to their own lives, rather than working within the framework of logic. </p>
<p>Indeed, the gospel itself, Paul declares, is mysterious and beyond human </p>
<p>wisdom, so that human logic would fail to fully grasp or appreciate the </p>
<p>gospel’s fullness. We might conclude that “the ethical concern explicit in </p>
<p>the exhortatio is implicit in the exordium/narratio of chapters 1–3.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>this reconstruction of Paul’s argument, then, his digression serves the </p>
<p>necessary purpose of connecting deeply with his audience, gaining their </p>
<p>good will and sympathy, before asking for concrete behaviors and atti-</p>
<p>tudes from his congregants.</p>
<p>In 3:1–13, Paul prepares for the exhortation in the next three chap-</p>
<p>ters by building rapport, emphasizing that his authority is based on his </p>
<p>noble character and giing from God, not on his rank or status as an </p>
<p>apostle. Paul identies himself as a prisoner, a minister or servant, and </p>
<p>less than the least of God’s saints. ese roles or positions are all for the </p>
