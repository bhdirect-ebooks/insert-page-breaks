<p>Ephesians 3:1–13</p>

<p>Second, the inextricable blending of the horizontal and vertical </p>
<p>helps interpret Paul’s claims about doing good works which God laid out </p>
in advance (Eph 2:10). If we see salvation by faith as individualistic only,
<p>then we imagine these works to be moral deeds, and we wonder about </p>
<p>the extent of our participation with God in doing them. But if we under-</p>
<p>stand salvation to include innately the creation of the new people of God, </p>
<p>then the good works are those done by the church as it stands as light in </p>
<p>the surrounding darkness. is amazing new community presents to the </p>
<p>dark world the awesome power of God to break seemingly unassailable </p>
<p>boundaries and create a new, holy, people united with bonds incompre-</p>
<p>hensible through human wisdom. Paul speaks similarly in Phil 1:27–30, </p>
<p>when he asks the church to strive together as one body in faith, stand-</p>
<p>ing rm against those in Philippi who oppose them. Paul connects their </p>
<p>struggles with his own, and as we know from Ephesians, these include his </p>
<p>imprisonment, which is traceable to his teachings on the oneness of Jew </p>
<p>and Gentile in Christ. Paul declares to the Philippians that their steadfast-</p>
<p>ness in the Spirit signals to their opponents the latter’s ultimate demise. </p>
<p>It also reveals the Philippians’ secure hope. “e reunion of the scattered </p>
<p>fragments of humanity in the Messiah is the sign to the world that here </p>
<p>we have nothing short of new creation.”</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>e building up of God’s kingdom, taking God’s light to darkness </p>
<p>and standing fast, is organically connected to one’s status as a child of God. </p>
<p>e missional aspect of salvation is not optional. Dietrich Bonhoeer </p>
<p>reected on this subject while imprisoned by the Nazis. He writes to </p>
<p>Eberhard Bethge (June 27, 1944):</p>
<p>e decisive factor is said to be that in Christianity the hope of </p>
<p>resurrection is proclaimed, and that that means the emergence of </p>
<p>a genuine religion of redemption, the main emphasis now being </p>
<p>on the far side of the boundary drawn by death. But it seems to me </p>
<p>that this is just where the mistake and the danger lie. Redemption </p>
<p>now means redemption from cares, distress, fears, and longings, </p>
<p>from sin and death, in a better world beyond the grave. But is this </p>
<p>really the essential character of the proclamation of Christ in the </p>
<p>gospels and by Paul? I should say it is not. e dierence between </p>
<p>the Christian hope of resurrection and the mythological hope is </p>
<p>that the former sends a man back to his life on earth in a wholly </p>
<p>new way which is even more sharply dened than it is in the Old </p>
