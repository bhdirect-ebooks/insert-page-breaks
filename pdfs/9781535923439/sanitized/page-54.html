<p>Ephesians 1:1–2</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>Paul would have understood believers living in the outlying towns around </p>
<p>Ephesus as recipients as well. Paul does something similar in 2 Cor 1:1 </p>
<p>wherein he addresses not only the Corinthians but all who live through-</p>
<p>out Achaia, for Corinth was the lead city in that region. I would add that </p>
<p>in 1 Cor 1:2 Paul addresses the letter not only to the church in Corinth, </p>
<p>but to believers everywhere. Parenthetically, this is interesting in as much </p>
<p>as 1 Corinthians deals with very specic problems and questions gener-</p>
<p>ated by that local church. Paul presents his response as required reading </p>
<p>for the whole church, not just the Corinthians. My point is that Paul can </p>
<p>speak very specically about local issues that he believes are pertinent to </p>
<p>the entire church; this suggests that Paul can likewise speak generally to a </p>
<p>wide audience. us when Paul wrote he was speaking to the local com-</p>
<p>munity and its struggles, but also with an eye, or at least frequent glances, </p>
<p>to the wider church, its mission in and witness to the world.</p>
<p>Paul’s Eulogy (1:3–14)</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, </p>
<p>who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual </p>
<p>blessing in Christ. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>For he chose us in him before the creation </p>
<p>of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>he </p>
<p>predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, </p>
<p>in accordance with his pleasure and will—</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>to the praise of </p>
<p>his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he </p>
<p>loves. </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>In him we have redemption through his blood, the for-</p>
<p>giveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>that he lavished on us. With all wisdom and understanding, </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his </p>
<p>good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ, </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>to be put into </p>
<p>eect when the times reach their fulllment—to bring unity </p>
<p>to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ. </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>In him </p>
<p>we were also chosen, having been predestined according to </p>
<p>the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with </p>
<p>the purpose of his will,</p>
<p> 12</p>
<p>in order that we, who were the rst </p>
<p>to put our hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>And you also were included in Christ when you heard </p>
