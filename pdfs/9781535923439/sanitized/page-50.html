<p>The City of Ephesus in Paul’s Day</p>
<p>e mixture of Jew and Gentile revealed in Paul’s letter mirrored the </p>
<p>larger social context. Josephus informs us that a sizable Jewish population </p>
<p>of 2000 families was resettled in this region by the Seleucids in the late </p>
<p>third century BCE.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>Probably some moved to Ephesus and established</p>
<p>their families and businesses. Jews in Ephesus were permitted to practice </p>
<p>their ancestral customs, although the latter half of the rst century BCE </p>
<p>included disputes with the Gentile leadership in the city. At the end of </p>
<p>the rst century BCE, Augustus established that Jews could follow their </p>
<p>own laws and customs, could send money and donations to Jerusalem, </p>
<p>and were excused from appearing in court on the Sabbath. Jews with </p>
<p>Roman citizenship were exempt from military service. In Paul’s day, Jews </p>
<p>and Gentiles apparently interacted with equanimity. Despite the fact that </p>
<p>a synagogue has not been excavated in Ephesus, both Josephus and the </p>
<p>book of Acts informs us of Jews meeting together.</p>

<p>e population of Ephesus likely numbered 200,000 to 250,000 in </p>
<p>the rst century CE, making it the third largest city in the Roman Empire </p>
<p>(Rome and Alexandria took rst and second place).</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>e city had much</p>
<p>to oer its inhabitants. It was located strategically at the mouth of the </p>
<p>Cayster River on the eastern coast of the Aegean Sea, providing easy </p>
<p>transport of goods and people into and out of western Asia Minor. In </p>
<p>31 BCE Ephesus was named the capital of the Roman province of Asia, </p>
<p>and within two years it included an imperial temple dedicated to Roma </p>
and the divine Julius Caesar. Wealth poured into the city, providing the
<p>resources to build magnicent temples, monuments, fountains, theaters, </p>
<p>baths, and houses. A visitor today can walk the lengthy paved main street </p>
<p>lined with elaborately carved columns and arches, remains of its glory </p>
<p>days. Terrace houses built into the hillside retain their beautiful mosaic </p>
<p>and fresco interior decorations, attesting to the auence of this ancient </p>
<p>city. In the 50s and 60s CE, Ephesians might be entertained in the grand </p>
<p>theater, which seated 25,000, or visit public baths and the gymnasium. </p>
<p>e exalted reputation of ancient Ephesus lay primarily in its magnicent </p>
<p>temple to Artemis. One of the seven wonders of the ancient world, it was </p>
<p>about four times larger than the Parthenon in Athens, making it the largest </p>
