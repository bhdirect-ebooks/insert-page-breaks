<p>Introduction</p>

<p>them a woe is reserved. It is, therefore, not to be wondered at if some have </p>
<p>attempted to adulterate the Lord’s writings also, since they have formed </p>
<p>designs even against writings which are of less account.”</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>One might argue that such late evidence does not help us with </p>
<p>Ephesians, which is an early work. In an interesting twist, some schol-</p>
<p>ars have suggested that the earliest church followed the Jewish practice </p>
<p>of accepting pseudepigraphic works, and that second-century Gentile </p>
<p>Christians condemned the practice.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>Some of the Jewish pseudepigraphic</p>
<p>texts cited to defend the theory, however, are from the apocalyptic genre, </p>
<p>which might as part of its literary technique attribute the text to a worthy </p>
<p>ancient such as Enoch or Ezra. e Christian biblical texts were written in </p>
<p>the apostolic age and use apostles’ names, not names of the distant past. </p>
<p>Additionally, 1 Baruch and its nal chapter, the Epistle of Jeremiah, while </p>
<p>part of the LXX and the Vulgate, were not included in the Jewish canon. It </p>
<p>is dicult, then, to state denitively from this example that Jews accepted </p>
<p>pseudepigraphy. e Epistle of Jeremiah does not begin with the sender’s </p>
<p>salutation, but the narrator indicates that this was a letter the prophet sent </p>
<p>to the exiles in Babylon. e lack of salutation limits its usefulness as a </p>
<p>direct comparison to Ephesians. Generally speaking, the pseudepigraphic </p>
<p>works use the names of ancient patriarchs or heroes of the faith, which in-</p>
<p>creases the possibility that the Jewish authors mirrored the Gentile writers. </p>
<p>Both looked back with admiration at their historical past, and wished to </p>
<p>have those great gures speak anew in their day. We might bring the book </p>
<p>of Hebrews into the discussion here. is work was ultimately put into </p>
<p>the Christian canon by connecting it with the Apostle Paul, though the </p>
<p>letter itself is anonymous. Origen’s discussion of Hebrews is instructive. </p>
<p>He recognizes that the style of speech is much better than Paul’s rough </p>
<p>wording. But he also observes that the content is Pauline, and suggests </p>
<p>that someone who was very familiar with Paul’s ideas, who perhaps even </p>
<p>took notes from the master, wrote the piece. Origen acknowledges that </p>
<p>those who claim it comes from Paul are right to say so. But as for him, he </p>
<p>declines to make any specic judgment, instead admitting that only God </p>
<p>knows who wrote it. at does not stop him quoting Hebrews as though </p>
<p>it were Paul’s work.</p>

<p> From this evidence two points should be empha-</p>
<p>37. Eusebius Hist. eccl. 4.23.12.</p>
<p>38. Bauckham 1983: 162.</p>
<p>39. Origen Princ. 3.1.10; 3.2.4; Cels. 7.29.</p>
