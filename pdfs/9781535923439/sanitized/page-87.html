<p>Fusing the Horizons: Citizenship</p>
<p>I take my U.S. citizenship for granted; I was born with it, did nothing to </p>
<p>earn it.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Sometimes I forget that it offers certain privileges and constitutional</p>
<p>rights. Citizenship in the ancient world was not taken for granted, indeed, it </p>
<p>was highly prized, for few enjoyed it. Having citizenship was a way to show </p>
<p>loyalty to Rome, and it gave Rome the opportunity to reward those who showed </p>
<p>allegiance. Julius Caesar started an aggressive program of granting citizen-</p>
<p>ship to aliens/peregrini. He gave Sicily Latin rights, very similar to Roman </p>
<p>citizenship. And he would grant Roman citizenship to whole legions of per-</p>
<p>egrini (foreigners) as a way to enfranchise them and give them a stake in the </p>
<p>republic. Augustus and Claudius continued the trend of offering citizenship </p>
<p>to more groups. By 212 CE, Emperor Caracalla gave Roman citizenship to all </p>
<p>free people in the empire.</p>
<p>Among the privileges of Roman citizenship was that of conubium, or </p>
<p>the right to enter a licit marriage, giving offspring the rank of Roman citizen, </p>
<p>and claim to the father’s estate. Additionally, Roman citizens had the right of </p>
<p>jus commercii (to own and sell property outright), and had access to Roman </p>
<p>courts. Citizens were not to be beaten or tortured before a trial. While both </p>
<p>women and men enjoyed these privileges, the latter beneﬁtted from the ad-</p>
<p>ditional rights of voting, joining the Roman legion, and holding public ofﬁce. </p>
<p>A registry of citizens’ names was kept in Rome and updated approximately </p>
<p>every ﬁve years, coordinated with the census. The names of freed slaves would </p>
<p>be recorded in the local registry with copies sent to Rome. Similarly, a child </p>
<p>born to a citizen would be registered within thirty days of birth, and a personal </p>
<p>copy could be kept at their home. The ofﬁcial document was held in the city’s </p>
<p>public archives and perhaps in Rome as well.</p>
<p>How did one become a citizen? One could be born a citizen, as was </p>
<p>Paul. Or one could purchase the privilege, as did Claudius Lysias, the tribune </p>
<p>who questioned Paul in Jerusalem (Acts 22:26–29; 23:26). One could bribe </p>
<p>ofﬁcials to have their name placed on a list of potential citizens going up </p>
<p>for nomination. And one could receive citizenship upon manumission from </p>
<p>2. Citizenship in the community of ancient Israel was similar in that it was the birth-</p>
<p>right of every Israelite to be a member of God’s household, a part of the covenant com-</p>
<p>munity. e gospel invites Gentiles in Christ to be full members of the new community </p>
<p>of God’s people.</p>
