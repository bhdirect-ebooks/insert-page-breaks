<p>Ephesians 1:3–14</p>

<p>tism. Certainly the message of Ephesians is solid teaching for any new </p>
<p>believer; however, we do not know enough about the rituals of the earliest </p>
<p>Christians to draw any rm conclusions. Moreover, Paul also uses simi-</p>
<p>lar language in Rom 8:4–30, including “sonship” and “Spirit” along with </p>
<p>“adoption,” “inheritance,” and “predestination.” Yet Rom 8:4–30 is not </p>
<p>understood as a baptismal text. e ten verses that make up the eulogy </p>
<p>introduce key terms, but also state God’s posture or attitude toward his </p>
<p>creation, including humans, namely that God desires his people for him-</p>
<p>self. We nd that God blesses, graces, and wills all for the benet of his </p>
<p>people, those who heeded the gospel invitation. Not only is God’s charac-</p>
<p>ter as one who abounds in grace established in Paul’s eulogy, but also the </p>
<p>method of demonstrating that grace is repeatedly emphasized: in Christ. </p>
<p>e blessings are ours in Christ, as is our forgiveness, inheritance, and </p>
<p>sonship. e full picture of Christ’s greatness is developed in the thanks-</p>
<p>giving (1:15–23). Here the emphasis is on how God worked in Christ to </p>
<p>accomplish his purpose, that is, to sum up all things in Christ, including </p>
<p>a people that are to the praise of God’s glory. Nor can this plan be fully </p>
<p>implemented without the work of the Holy Spirit who seals those who are </p>
<p>in Christ. e third member of the Trinity not only secures the promises </p>
<p>of salvation those in Christ enjoy, but also enables believers to resist the </p>
<p>evil forces that do battle against the faithful (6:12, 18).</p>
<p>Structure of 1:3–14</p>
<p>Verses 1:3–14 form a eulogy or blessing to God the Father, who has ex-</p>
<p>tended grace through his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. Verse 3 announces </p>
<p>that God is blessed, and vv. 4–10 explain further why such a claim is valid, </p>
<p>while vv. 11–14 show how these claims impact believers directly. One way </p>
<p>to march through this passage is to note how Paul describes God’s actions </p>
<p>by focusing on the verbs (usually participles). Paul declares that God </p>
<p>chose us (1:4), blessed us (1:6), and lavished his grace upon us (1:8). God </p>
<p>the Father made known to us (1:9) what he also purposed (1:10), namely </p>
<p>that he was summing up or uniting all things in Christ (1:10). rough </p>
<p>God’s power and by his will, we were made an inheritance (1:11) and </p>
<p>were predestined (1:11) to be those whose corporate life is to the praise of </p>
<p>God’s glory. Both those who rst heard (1:12) and those who have more </p>
<p>recently attended to and believed the gospel (1:12) now are sealed (1:13) </p>
<p>in the Holy Spirit assuring redemption, again to God’s glory.</p>
