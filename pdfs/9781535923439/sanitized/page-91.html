<p>Christ Breaks Down the Dividing Wall</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>act would have resulted in the deling Gentile’s death. Why might such an </p>
<p>accusation be leveled against Paul, unless he in fact taught that in Christ </p>
<p>no barrier existed? I am not suggesting that Paul violated the temple or </p>
<p>would put at risk one of his fellow believers. But in his teachings, it is </p>
<p>likely that Paul contrasted the physical barriers of the Jerusalem temple </p>
<p>with what all believers now have in Christ, namely full access to the Father </p>
<p>through the blood of the Son. Nor am I suggesting that Paul wants to give </p>
<p>Gentiles the same access to the temple as the Jews had—this was the mis-</p>
<p>take made by his accusers, and reveals their narrow vision. Paul does not </p>
<p>promote equal opportunity for Gentiles, for that would tacitly accept the </p>
<p>present system with minor (though important) variations. In Christ, the </p>
<p>entire system of Law, temple, and sacrice is rendered obsolete. e point </p>
<p>is that a new person now exists where once there was Jew and Gentile. </p>
<p>e promises of God have their fulllment. e new person is a preview </p>
<p>of the new creation, the new heavens and new earth. With Christ’s death </p>
<p>and resurrection, with the lling of the Spirit, the believer is now part of </p>
<p>the new creation.</p>
<p>e Term “Hostility” in Paul’s Argument</p>
<p>Equally dicult to understand is Paul’s comment concerning the law </p>
<p>of the commandments in ordinances, and its relationship to what pre-</p>
<p>cedes it: “the hostility in his esh.” We are le to decide Paul’s intentions </p>
<p>based on grammar rules, which can be broken. Certain questions need </p>
<p>answered, including whether the term “hostility” should be understood </p>
to explain the dividing wall and whether this wall was broken in his esh,
<p>or whether the law was abolished in his esh. Additionally, we must ex-</p>
<p>plore why Paul described the law with further qualiers “commands” and </p>
<p>“regulations.”</p>
<p>To the rst set of issues, the questions revolve around whether the </p>
<p>phrase “the hostility in his esh” connects with the previous participle </p>
<p>“having broken down” or with the following participle “having annulled </p>
<p>or abrogated.” One possible reading is to connect “hostility” with the pre-</p>
ceding dividing wall as a further descriptor. is hostility would then be
<p>destroyed or broken down. However, it is not typical for modiers to be </p>
<p>on both sides of a participle. is implies a second, more likely reading, </p>
<p>where “hostility” would further dene the law of the commandments. A </p>
<p>related question is the place of the phrase “in his esh.” It might refer back </p>
