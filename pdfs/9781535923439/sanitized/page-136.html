<p>Ephesians 5:1–6</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>the connection between God the Father and his children, the church.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A second possible reason is that Paul will go on to emphasize walking </p>
<p>as Christ walked. Finally Paul might be reecting the charge in Lev 19:2, </p>
<p>“Be holy because I, the Lord your God, am holy.” Jesus speaks similarly in </p>
<p>Matt 5:48, “Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly father is perfect.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Paul’s second command follows closely on the rst, and also imag-</p>
<p>ines a daily commitment to act in line with God’s truth and love. Believers </p>
<p>are to walk in love; this image is found throughout the Old Testament </p>
<p>as the manner in which a faithful follower of God lives obediently each </p>
<p>day. Everyone can visualize walking; it implies a goal and a gait. e goal </p>
<p>is the kingdom of God (5:5). e gait is a pace whose rhythm is love, so </p>
<p>one travels as fast or slow as is needed to display charity similar to the </p>
<p>self-giving love of Christ. Paul uses this verb repeatedly in ch. 4 as a word </p>
<p>picture of the Christian life. Both in 4:1 and now in 5:2, Paul stresses that </p>
<p>the believer is to walk in love. As explained in 4:2 and 5:2, this love in-</p>
<p>volves the decision to act humbly, self-sacricially, and patiently. Christ’s </p>
<p>love is expressed as a sacrice on our behalf to God.</p>
<p>Believers are described in this section as dearly loved children (5:1) </p>
<p>and as the Lord’s people (“holy ones” 5:3), those who will inherit the king-</p>
<p>dom of Christ and of God (5:5). Because of their standing before God </p>
<p>and their new nature in Christ, the injunctions to love and the warnings </p>
<p>against idolatry are possible to live out. e expectation is that just as </p>
<p>children imitate their parents because they want to grow up to be just like </p>
<p>them, so too children of God will desire to emulate the character of their </p>
<p>Father and their Brother. In other words, the moral obligations outlined </p>
<p>by Paul are given to those who have been made new so as to fulll those </p>
<p>imperatives.</p>
<p>Walking in love is antithetical to acting with base motives, greed, </p>
<p>sexual impropriety, or moral bankruptcy. Walking in love cannot counte-</p>
<p>nance impure language, loud-mouth braggarts, and jokes that shame oth-</p>
<p>ers. Said positively, believers are distinguished by their moral honor and </p>
<p>sexual propriety, by their generosity in speech and action, and by their </p>
<p>contentment. In sum, they act in character with the God they worship. </p>
<p>is is why Paul can say that greed, fornication, rude jokes, and moral </p>
<p>impurity are examples of idolatry—these deeds reect the character of </p>
<p>1. Paul also speaks of imitating Christ in 1 Cor 11:1 and 1 ess 1:6.</p>
<p>2. e Greek term translated “perfect” has the sense of being mature or accomplish-</p>
<p>ing the task for which one was made.</p>
