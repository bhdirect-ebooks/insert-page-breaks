<p>Paul’s Eulogy</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you </p>
<p>believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised </p>
<p>Holy Spirit, </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance </p>
<p>until the redemption of those who are God’s possession—to </p>
<p>the praise of his glory.</p>
<p>Paul’s eulogy serves to inform even as it praises. Key ideas and terms </p>
<p>that will surface throughout the letter are introduced here. Even more, </p>
<p>the context for those key thoughts is created, and the grand narrative of </p>
<p>salvation history is briey sketched, with certain segments to be lled in </p>
<p>later in greater depth. e importance of this narrative cannot be overes-</p>
<p>timated for those who believe the teachings of Ephesians are directed not </p>
<p>just to rst-century believers, but to the church today. Key concepts like </p>
<p>predestination, forgiveness, sonship, or grace do not merely oat on the </p>
<p>surface, as though they can be plucked from the letter and given deni-</p>
<p>tions as part of a formal schema. Rather, Paul sets these terms within </p>
<p>God’s overarching story, beginning with creation and the fall and even </p>
<p>before time itself, as Paul reaches back before the foundation of the world </p>
<p>for his starting point to narrate God’s activities in his own time and place, </p>
<p>the rst century CE in the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>is story includes two groups of characters, the Jews and the </p>
<p>Gentiles. is reality comes into sharp focus in chapter 2, but here in </p>
<p>chapter 1 Paul only touches upon it with his explanation about “we” who </p>
<p>were rst in Christ and “you” (Gentiles in Ephesus) who heard the gospel </p>
<p>and believed. He expresses a similar thought in Rom 1:16, that the gos-</p>
<p>pel came to the Jew rst and then to the Gentile. e grand narrative of </p>
<p>God’s redemptive work must include a discussion or recognition at least </p>
<p>of God’s work in and through Israel and its prophets and promises. For </p>
<p>Paul it is not the distinction between Jews and Gentiles which captures </p>
<p>his attention—such was common knowledge and general experience in </p>
<p>his day. Rather, what seized his imagination was their unity through the </p>
<p>gospel.</p>
<p>Along with the grand narrative providing the foundation for Paul’s </p>
<p>thought, it has been suggested that the earliest use of this epistle was a </p>
<p>baptismal catechesis. Principal terms found in Jesus’ baptism story (see </p>
<p>Matt 3:13–15; Mark 1:9–11; Luke 3:21–22; John 1:29–34) are also found </p>
<p>here, including “Son” (Ephesians has “sonship”), “good pleasure,” “be-</p>
<p>loved,” and “Spirit.” Additionally, forgiveness of sins was tied with bap-</p>
