<p>Fusing the Horizons: God’s Plan, Uniting All Things in Christ</p>
<p>Paul hints in 1:10 of the enormity of God’ s plan in his statement that all </p>
<p>things will be united in Christ, both in heaven and on earth. N. T . Wright has </p>
<p>said that “we must envisage a world in which the present creation, which we </p>
<p>think of in those three dimensions [space, time and matter], is enhanced, </p>
<p>taken up into God’ s larger purposes, no doubt, but certainly not abandoned.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The resurrection of Jesus indicates that God did not reject his creation, but </p>
<p>seeks to redeem it through Christ. Our worship and our mission should be </p>
<p>eschatologically focused. That means we do away with the dualism between </p>
<p>spirit and body , which in church missions looked like saving souls without </p>
<p>tending to bodily needs. Instead, a humble church should sing notes of grace </p>
<p>to the present world. God’ s redemptive work establishing the church as a </p>
<p>beachhead in this present age means that believers should engage in bringing </p>
<p>God’ s mercy , justice, and grace to our communities at all levels—schools, hos-</p>
<p>pitals, and governments—as a real, natural, and expected part of the church’ s </p>
<p>conviction that Christ is now Lord of all, not just of believers’ hearts. The </p>
<p>homeless shelters, arts in the community programs, ﬁnancial help for disad-</p>
<p>vantaged, and so much more are the concrete expressions of the conviction </p>
<p>that God in Christ has redeemed the world, and that Christ is Lord now over all </p>
