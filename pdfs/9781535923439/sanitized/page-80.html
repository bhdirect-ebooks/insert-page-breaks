<p>Ephesians 2:1–10</p>

<p>know conclusively why Paul used dōron in Eph 2:8; however, its closeness </p>
<p>to dōrea, used by Paul to express the extreme generosity of God’s salva-</p>
<p>tion, suggests this was Paul’s intention as well in 2:8.</p>
<p>Grace through Faith, Not Works</p>
<p>Paul stresses that salvation is by grace, through faith, not works. If the </p>
<p>analysis above is accurate, then at this point Paul is especially focused on </p>
<p>the Gentiles’ salvation in Christ. So why would Paul contrast grace and </p>
<p>works? Typically the term “works” is understood as deeds done to earn </p>
<p>merit before God. Would a Gentile be thinking like this? Paul cautions </p>
<p>the Corinthians that God’s choice of the foolish and weak was to prevent </p>
<p>anyone from boasting before him (1 Cor 1:28, see also 4:7). And in Rom </p>
<p>2:1–16 a strong case can be made that Paul is talking about Gentiles (he </p>
<p>rst mentions Jews specically in 2:17). If so, then Gentiles appeared to </p>
<p>be tempted to focus on deeds; Paul speaks of those deeds done with evil </p>
<p>intent being condemned by God. Gentiles have not earned God’s approv-</p>
<p>al, any more than Jews earn God’s approval. Paul cautioned the Roman </p>
<p>Gentile believers not to be haughty over against Jews (Rom 11:18), and </p>
<p>the same attitude might be in view here. Ethnic pride and identity ran </p>
<p>quite deep in the ancient world, and Paul addresses it head-on as it pre-</p>
<p>sented a grave danger to the church’s unity. ere is no place for boasting </p>
<p>in oneself in the church.</p>
<p>Quite the opposite of boasting, grace has been a central theme from </p>
<p>the beginning of the epistle, emphasized in 1:6–7 in connection with </p>
<p>God’s glory and his generosity. Grace is that favor which is unmerited, </p>
<p>undeserved, and even unexpected (from a human standpoint). e mus-</p>
<p>cular arm of God reaching to Adam as painted by Michelangelo on the </p>
<p>Sistine chapel’s ceiling calls to mind the grace of God inasmuch as God’s </p>
<p>grace is active, not static or theoretical. God’s grace calls, saves, brings life. </p>
<p>God’s grace pursues those who are running from him (Rom 5:8). God’s </p>
<p>grace is grounded in and grows from his bottomless love, as Paul stresses </p>
<p>in 2:4. In sum, Paul argues that believers are saved in Christ on the basis </p>
<p>of grace.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Paul does not use the term “justied” here, but rather </p>
<p>“saved.” Ephesians is unique in Paul’s letters in using the verb “saved” in </p>
<p>the perfect tense in this context. Should we treat the terms as synonyms? </p>
