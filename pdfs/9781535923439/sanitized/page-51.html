<p>Introduction</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>Greek temple in the ancient world. Poets praised its unmatched splendor, </p>
<p>including Antipater of Sidon who, comparing the temple to the hanging </p>
<p>gardens of Babylon, the colossus, and the pyramids of Egypt, declared </p>
<p>“but when I saw the house of Artemis that mounted to the clouds, those </p>
<p>other marvels lost their brilliancy, and I said, ‘Lo, apart from Olympus, </p>
<p>the Sun never looked on aught so grand.’”</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>Sadly today, all that is le of its</p>
<p>former majesty is a single column providing a nesting place for birds.</p>
