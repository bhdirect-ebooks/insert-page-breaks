<p>Walk in New Life</p>

<p>“In your anger do not sin”: Do not let the sun go </p>
<p>down while you are still angry, </p>
<p>27</p>
<p>and do not give the devil a </p>
<p>foothold. </p>
<p>28</p>
<p>ose who have been stealing must steal no lon-</p>
<p>ger, but must work, doing something useful with their own </p>
<p>hands, that they may have something to share with those in </p>
<p>need. </p>
<p>29</p>
<p>Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your </p>
<p>mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up ac-</p>
<p>cording to their needs, that it may benet those who listen. </p>
<p>30</p>
<p>And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you </p>
<p>were sealed for the day of redemption.</p>
<p> 31</p>
<p>Get rid of all bitter-</p>
<p>ness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every </p>
<p>form of malice.</p>
<p> 32</p>
<p>Be kind and compassionate to one another, </p>
<p>forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.</p>
<p>A second time in this chapter Paul entreats the Ephesians to walk in a par-</p>
<p>ticular way. In 4:1, it was to walk worthy of one’s calling, and in 4:17 it is </p>
<p>to walk in a manner completely opposite that of the Gentiles. e calling </p>
<p>of God is antithetical to paganism because the latter is alienated from the </p>
<p>one true God. A sharp contrast is drawn, on the one hand, between the </p>
<p>Gentiles whose wisdom is futile and whose minds run to immorality and, </p>
<p>on the other hand, the believers who know or learn Christ (4:20). is </p>
<p>truth is lived out in great measure by their kind, compassionate speech </p>
<p>which encourages others. e visual picture drawn in this section is the </p>
<p>putting o of the old person, and the putting on of the new. Paul’s anthro-</p>
<p>pology and eschatology are revealed in this image of old and new, but the </p>
<p>meaning of section 4:20–24 has been contested and so will be examined </p>
<p>closely below. Before turning to examine this section in depth, a com-</p>
<p>ment about Gentiles in this argument is in order. In Paul’s larger world, </p>
people were divided into categories, including a fundamental one of Jew
<p>and Gentile. ere was no third option. But for Paul, when a person is in </p>
<p>Christ, they no longer t the world’s categories. ey are not Jew, but they </p>
<p>are also not Gentile. is completely new category only exists in the new </p>
<p>age, which has broken in on the present age with Christ’s resurrection. </p>
<p>e revolutionary power of God can be seen in our midst with a com-</p>
<p>pletely new people created in Christ, and the church’s ongoing witness is </p>
<p>to live in line with this new reality.</p>
