<p>Christ Our Peace</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>themselves “the circumcision” (which is done in the body </p>
<p>by human hands)—</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>remember that at that time you were </p>
<p>separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and </p>
<p>foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and </p>
<p>without God in the world. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>But now in Christ Jesus you who </p>
<p>once were far away have been brought near by the blood of </p>
<p>Christ. </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>For he himself is our peace, who has made the two </p>
one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostil-
<p>ity, </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>by setting aside in his esh the law with its commands </p>
<p>and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new </p>
<p>humanity out of the two, thus making peace, </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>and in one </p>
<p>body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by </p>
<p>which he put to death their hostility.</p>
<p> 17</p>
<p>He came and preached </p>
<p>peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were </p>
<p>near. </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>For through him we both have access to the Father </p>
<p>by one Spirit. </p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Consequently, you are no longer foreigners </p>
<p>and strangers, but fellow citizens with God’s people and also </p>
<p>members of his household, </p>
<p>20</p>
<p>built on the foundation of the </p>
<p>apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief </p>
<p>cornerstone. </p>
<p>21</p>
<p>In him the whole building is joined together </p>
<p>and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. </p>
<p>22</p>
<p>And in him </p>
<p>you too are being built together to become a dwelling in </p>
<p>which God lives by his Spirit.</p>
<p>In the second half of the chapter, Paul identies two consequences of his </p>
<p>previous declarations that believers (Jew and Gentile) are God’s master-</p>
<p>piece. Both these statements are introduced by “therefore” (2:11, 19). e </p>
<p>claims made are further elaborated upon in 2:14–18, which discusses </p>
<p>how it is that Gentiles and Jews share in Christ. Paul’s argument is more </p>
<p>explicit and detailed here than at the beginning of the chapter, for he fur-</p>
<p>ther denes both humanity’s situation and Christ’s role in God’s salvation </p>
<p>plan. To capture these twin emphases, we will look rst at Paul’s argu-</p>
<p>ment concerning Jews and Gentiles in 2:11–13, 19–22 and then focus on </p>
<p>2:14–18.</p>
