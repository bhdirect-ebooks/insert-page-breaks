<p>Slaves and Masters Addressed</p>

<p>their slaves harshly should expect similar treatment from their heavenly </p>
<p>Master, who shows no favoritism to someone with a higher social status. </p>
<p>Before God, in other words, the owner is stripped of all social privilege </p>
<p>and is judged on how they treated another human being, who might also </p>
<p>be a believer. With this underlying assumption, Paul undercuts the power </p>
<p>of the institution of slavery and its attending reliance on social rank and </p>
<p>status. However, it would be another 1700 years before the church engaged </p>
<p>in serious reection on the institution of slavery. e discussion between </p>
<p>abolitionists and proslavery proponents is instructive as a window into </p>
<p>reading the Bible as faithful followers of Jesus.</p>
<p>In 1861, Philip Scha presciently wrote that the matter of hu-</p>
<p>man equality for African Americans involves more than simply the is-</p>
<p>sue of slavery itself, “the negro question lies far deeper than the slavery </p>
<p>question.”</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>But his observation went undeveloped as Americans debated</p>
<p>the institution of (black) slavery. Faithful churchgoers turning to the Bible </p>
<p>for answers were guided by several presuppositions. For example, they </p>
saw the individual as the supreme authority in interpretation. Common
<p>sense guided the reading, which focused on a literal meaning that did </p>
<p>not take into account the historical distance between the biblical period </p>
and their own. Individual verses read in isolation took precedence over
<p>the biblical author’s overarching concerns or sentiments. e tendency </p>
<p>to see the Bible as holding propositional truths and to downplay both </p>
<p>the historical context and the narrative of God’s redemptive story further </p>
<p>undermined their eorts.</p>
<p>A “straightforward” reading of the Bible crashed against the rocks of </p>
<p>the abolitionist claims. Jonathan Blanchard, an abolitionist and the rst </p>
<p>president of Wheaton College, Illinois, declared that “abolitionists take </p>
<p>their stand upon the New Testament doctrine of the natural equity of </p>
<p>man. e one-bloodism of human kind [from Acts 17:26]:—and upon </p>
<p>those great principles of human rights, drawn from the New Testament, </p>
<p>and announced in the American Declaration of Independence, declaring </p>
<p>that all men have natural and inalienable rights to person, property and </p>
<p>the pursuit of happiness.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>e abolitionist argument was complex and</p>
<p>nuanced, and looked to historical context and current philosophical con-</p>
<p>versations for additional perspective. ey argued that the spirit of the </p>
