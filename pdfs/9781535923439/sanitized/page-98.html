<p>Fusing the Horizons: Prison Ministry Then and Now</p>
<p>Paul had visitors helping him cope with his house arrest and conﬁnement, </p>
<p>including Epaphroditus from Philippi (Phil 2:25–30). They brought food, </p>
<p>companionship, and facilitated Paul’s continuing ministry to the churches. </p>
<p>But it would be many centuries before Christians showed an interest in prison </p>
<p>conditions. In the early 1800s, Elizabeth Fry took up the challenge. Raised a </p>
<p>Quaker, she desired that the Scriptures and the inner light of Christ guide her. </p>
<p>She was married with several children when asked by a friend to visit Newgate </p>
<p>prison, a hellhole in the midst of London. She was appalled at the conditions </p>
<p>in which the female prisoners existed, and immediately began to organize </p>
<p>aid. She brought clothing, established a chapel, began an education program, </p>
<p>and instituted Bible reading. She developed a prison management system of </p>
<p>matrons and supervisors, and established compulsory sewing. She promoted </p>
<p>her reforms both to Parliament and in towns throughout Britain, and extended </p>
<p>her vision to include workhouses, mental asylums, and hospitals. In the midst </p>
<p>of her work and personal hardship, she wrote “how have the gospel truths </p>
<p>opened gradually on my view, the height, the depth, length and breadth of the </p>
<p>love of God in Christ Jesus, to my unspeakable help and consolation.”</p>

<p>Her</p>
<p>concerns both for prison conditions and prisoner education continue today. </p>
<p>Prison Fellowship, begun by Chuck Colson in 1976, is one of many Christian </p>
<p>prison ministries that embrace the words of Jesus, “I was in prison and you </p>
<p>came to visit me” (Matt 25:36). Jesus’ focus here is likely those believers </p>
<p>imprisoned for preaching the good news. Today many Christian groups extend </p>
<p>the mission to all prisoners, following Christ’s general call to have compassion </p>
<p>on the vulnerable in society.</p>
<p>Paul, a Servant</p>
<p>Additionally, Paul calls himself a servant (diakonos, 3:7) and the least of </p>
<p>the lowest of the saints (3:8). With so many churches named for St. Paul </p>
<p>today, we are tempted to hear false modesty in these claims. However, </p>
<p>Paul on other occasions identied himself as God’s slave (doulos). Again, </p>
<p>when speaking about his apostleship to the Corinthians, he notes that </p>
<p>he was the least of the apostles, using a word oen translated “as one </p>
