<p>Ephesians 4:1–16</p>

<p>additional notes. First, that each believer is given grace by Christ, who </p>
<p>also gives to his body gis of theological leadership in the form of apos-</p>
<p>tles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers (4:7–12). Second, each </p>
<p>person being thus equipped for ministry will grow into Christ (4:13–16).</p>
<p>One Calling by the One God (4:1–6)</p>
<p>In this single sentence in Greek, Paul exhorts his readers to grab hold of, </p>
<p>in an experiential way, the unique standing they enjoy in Christ. Paul uses </p>
<p>the indicative form of parakaleō (to encourage or exhort) here and in a </p>
<p>similar phrase in Rom 12:1. In both places, the exhortation to holy living </p>
<p>follows immediately aer a doxology. e vision of the exalted God leads </p>
<p>Paul to urge believers fervently to act in such a way that their lives testify </p>
<p>to the truth of that awe-inspiring vision. Paul stresses several key terms </p>
<p>that will guide his argument throughout the chapter: calling, love, and </p>
<p>unity. And he imagines this unity in love being realized in the daily lives </p>
<p>of believers. Paul speaks of walking one’s calling, of having humility and </p>
<p>meekness which models the character of the Triune God and reects the </p>
<p>hope of our salvation. His status as prisoner in the Lord operates in the </p>
<p>background and will serve as an example of leadership when he speaks </p>
<p>of gis in 4:11.</p>
<p>Paul’s metaphorical use of the term “walk” (translated in TNIV as </p>
<p>“live a life”) reveals his deep Jewish heritage. Oen Jewish writers speak of </p>
<p>a faithful life as walking with God. e image creates a picture of action, </p>
<p>eort, and purpose. Paul uses the verb elsewhere (5:2, 8, 15) as he envi-</p>
<p>sions the believers’ faithful, fruitful lives in Christ. He also uses the word </p>
<p>once (2:2) to reference the habits and lifestyle the Ephesians previously </p>
<p>engaged in prior to their calling. Paul strongly urges the essalonians </p>
<p>to walk worthy of their calling in God’s Kingdom (1 ess 2:11–12; see </p>
<p>also Phil 1:27; Col 1:10). In describing this life, Paul does not oer here a </p>
<p>list of dos and don’ts, but sets before them holy attitudes that should gov-</p>
<p>ern all actions. Paul highlights three: humility, gentleness, and patience. </p>
<p>Interestingly, in his speech to the Ephesians in Acts 20:19, Paul uses the </p>
<p>same rare term for humility that we nd here. In this speech, he points to </p>
<p>his own actions among the Ephesians, how he served the Lord by coura-</p>
<p>geously preaching the good news in the teeth of tough opposition. Paul is </p>
<p>speaking to them on his journey to Jerusalem, expecting that hardships, </p>
<p>imprisonments, and aictions await him (he was correct). He encourages </p>
