<p>Ephesians 5:21–32</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>Household Codes (5:21—6:9)</p>
<p>Believers walk in the Spirit; they speak psalms, sing and make melody in </p>
<p>their hearts, give thanks always, and submit. e Spirit-lled life imag-</p>
<p>ined by Paul is one of deep joy that bubbles to the surface where it runs </p>
<p>over blessing others. Such a life is lived in community, celebrating God </p>
<p>the Father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I want to pause a moment </p>
<p>and let this vision sink in. We will move to one of the most contentious </p>
<p>passages of Scripture next, the household codes. So we need to stop for a </p>
<p>moment and realize that the Spirit-lled life, the life of joy and thanksgiv-</p>
<p>ing, moves out from the church into the social ordering of relationships. </p>
<p>is larger world included for Paul basic human structures such as parent </p>
<p>and child, as well as social institutions such as slavery. And it included </p>
<p>marriage, which, like parent and child, is a basic human relationship that </p>
<p>each society shapes to t its political, economic, and cultural values. It </p>
<p>is onto the rst-century social grid that Paul places the ethics of Christ </p>
<p>with its amazing transformative powers to redeem human attitudes and </p>
<p>perspectives.</p>
<p>Into the Greco-Roman cultural construct, Paul speaks of Christ’s </p>
<p>model of love and of the Christian ethic. Some imagine this love as a coat </p>
<p>placed over the body politic, the Roman society and social institutions. </p>
<p>e coat molds itself to the person and serves not to critique the body, but </p>
<p>to adjust to it and protect it from harm. A conclusion is then drawn from </p>
<p>the analogy that Christian ethics rehabilitate the social structures of mar-</p>
<p>riage and parenting and slavery, getting rid of the abuses that come from </p>
<p>sin. Indeed, this approach was active in the slavery debate a century or so </p>
<p>ago in the United States. e institution was salvageable, so long as it wore </p>
<p>the coat of Christian ethics. However, this is not Paul’s message. e coat </p>
<p>of Christian ethics is one that changes the underlying body. Rather than </p>
<p>the coat conforming to the body and improving its capabilities to keep </p>
<p>warm, the coat of Christ’s love, the Spirit-lled coat, actually changes the </p>
<p>body to conform to it. We have examples of these sorts of coats or body </p>
<p>wrappings. I remember in high school watching wrestlers desperate to </p>
<p>make weight run in rubber sweat suits, and seeing ads for women’s girdles </p>
<p>designed to pull in the belly. ese “coats” changed the body, though only </p>
<p>temporarily. e change Paul imagines is permanent, as we saw in 4:24, </p>
<p>as Christians put on their new self. Paul is not suggesting that Christ is </p>
<p>accommodating himself to us, but rather that in wearing Christ, we begin </p>
