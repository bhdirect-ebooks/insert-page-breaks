<p>argues that Paul explains how the believers’ godly demeanor and attitude, </p>
<p>their “light,” exposes the darkness, and transforms it.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Verse 5:13 explains</p>
<p>5:11 by describing what happens when light shines on darkness, that is, </p>
<p>those deeds done in secret. Light reveals darkness as evil; in so doing, </p>
<p>people can see evil for what it really is, and be drawn to light. Isn’t this </p>
<p>what happened to the Ephesians, as described by Paul in 5:8? Jesus uses </p>
<p>similar language in John 3:19–21, while in 1 Cor 14:24–25 Paul applies </p>
<p>comparable language when urging the Corinthians to prophesy rather </p>
<p>than speak in tongues in their gatherings. e unbeliever will pass by, </p>
<p>Paul says, and be convicted by hearing their prophecy. e rebuke here </p>
<p>is an implicit one, as the truth of the gospel spoken in the church meet-</p>
<p>ing makes manifest the hidden darkness of the unbeliever’s heart. Finally, </p>
<p>Paul’s hymn in 5:14 brings to mind the call to salvation, reminding the </p>
<p>Ephesians of their own conversion. e hymn draws from Isa 26:19</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>60:1–2.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>In Isa 60:1–2, 18–22, God’s redemptive acts restore Israel, for</p>
<p>God is the Redeemer. Moreover, “nations will come to your light, and </p>
<p>kings to the brightness of your dawn” (60:3) holds a promise of Gentiles </p>
<p>being drawn into God’s people. In Christ, the redemption of Gentiles has </p>
<p>been accomplished.</p>
<p>Another command continues the image of light, as Paul orders that </p>
<p>the Ephesians see</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>very carefully how they walk (5:15), for they must be</p>
<p>wise. He follows with a pair of commands that they not become foolish, </p>
<p>but rather understand the purposes of God. ey must realize that the </p>
<p>present age is one governed by evil, by attitudes and practices that are </p>
<p>antithetical to God’s goodness, joy, and redemption. A third pair of com-</p>
<p>mands enjoins the believer not to be drunk with wine, but to be lled with </p>
<p>the Spirit. Paul contrasts the person wholly controlled by distorted mental </p>
<p>and emotional capacities with the one who has completely surrendered to </p>
<p>the leading of God’s Spirit. In the second case, the person has attained a </p>

<p>6. Isa 26:19 reads, “But your dead will live, Lord; their bodies will rise—let those who </p>
<p>dwell in the dust wake up and shout for joy—your dew is like the dew of the morning; </p>
<p>you will make it fall on the spirits of the dead.” e context is restoration, judgment </p>
<p>against those who work evil, and blessing to those who walk righteously.</p>
<p>7. Isa 60:1–2 reads, “Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord </p>
<p>rises upon you. See, darkness covers the earth and thick darkness is over the peoples, but </p>
<p>the Lord rises upon you and his glory appears over you.”</p>
