<p>Put On the Full Armor of God</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>of the word of God in 1:13 and 5:26. He underscores salvation in 1:13; </p>
<p>2:5–8; 5:23, and faith in several verses in chapter one (vv. 1, 13, 15, 19) </p>
<p>and in 2:8; 3:12, 17; 4:5, 13. His focus on prayer in 6:16–18 includes terms </p>
<p>used elsewhere in the epistle, such as the phrase “all the Lord’s people” </p>
<p>in 1:16, “mystery” (1:9; 3:3–9; 5:32), boldness or condence (3:12), and </p>
<p>imprisonment (3:1; 4:1). e cumulative eect of the data suggests that </p>
<p>Paul pulls together the important concepts he has articulated throughout </p>
<p>the letter in this nal section. e full armor of God presents a striking </p>
<p>picture of the believer, and the church as Christ’s body, prepared to face </p>
<p>the forces of evil.</p>
<p>In this section two key verbs stand out: “be strong” (6:10) and </p>
<p>“stand” (6:11, 13, 14). Also, two main ideas are expounded upon: “the full </p>
<p>armor of God” (6:11, 13) and the powers of darkness (6:12). e opening </p>
<p>command “be strong” (6:10) is in the present tense, suggesting a continu-</p>
<p>ing call to be empowered. A similar call is found in 4:23, when Paul asks </p>
<p>the Ephesians to renew their minds. Paul follows his order to be strong </p>
<p>with four past-tense (aorist) participles, suggesting that the putting on </p>
<p>of the armor is a singular event that will continue to oer protection and </p>
<p>strength. By combining the present imperative and the aorist participles, </p>
<p>Paul stresses that the armor has been put on as a single event, but needs </p>
<p>to be continually utilized. An incomplete analogy might be to think of </p>
<p>seatbelts in a car—they are only helpful when the driver buckles up. Paul </p>
<p>is deadly serious about the potential damage the devil can do to believ-</p>
<p>ers, and the serious nature of the battle. Perhaps he is reecting similar </p>
<p>thoughts when he writes from Ephesus to the Corinthians (1 Cor 15:32) </p>
<p>that he fought with “wild beasts” in Ephesus (see the discussion in the </p>
<p>Introduction). e picture is of struggle and danger, which he faced be-</p>
<p>cause he believed the dead are raised. In both places, Paul speaks of the </p>
<p>power of God’s might which God exerted when he raised Jesus from the </p>
<p>dead. e gospel message oends not only the sensibilities of Jews and </p>
<p>Gentiles, but it also challenges the powers, rulers, and authorities in the </p>
<p>heavenlies. erefore, God provides full armor for the battle.</p>
<p>e participles (having buckled, having put on, having tted one’s </p>
<p>feet, having taken up) are all in the past tense. Paul uses the past tense as </p>
<p>well in 4:24 when he calls on the believers to put on the new person. Some </p>
<p>suggest Paul equates the new self with God’s armor, and so equates the </p>
<p>church to Christ. According to this view, the church is the center of God’s </p>
<p>saving actions, for it is Christ’s body and Christ is only fully Christ when </p>
