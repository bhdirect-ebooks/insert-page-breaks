<p>economic Trinity, which focuses on how God is redeeming creation. e </p>
<p>economic Trinity stresses distinction (Jesus Christ emptied himself) for </p>
<p>the purposes of redemption. e ontological Trinity is the union of the </p>
<p>ree-in-One which has no distinction in essence; all three are co-equally </p>
<p>God. is verse (1:3) introduces the phrase “in the heavenly realms,” a </p>
<p>phrase used only in Ephesians, but found six times, suggesting its im-</p>
<p>portance. e term “heavenly” is used in 1 Cor 15.48 (see also Phil 2:10), </p>
<p>which contrasts the earthly body and the heavenly body, the earthly man </p>
<p>and the heavenly man. Paul continues that esh and blood cannot inherit </p>
<p>the kingdom, and Paul reveals the mystery that at the last trumpet sound, </p>
<p>the dead will rise imperishable. ese terms, inherit and mystery, are </p>
<p>found as well in Ephesians, with a similar point made: we have redemp-</p>
<p>tion through his blood, an inheritance. In Ephesians, “heavenly” is in the </p>
<p>dative with the preposition en, which carries a sense of location. Why </p>
<p>does he stress the dative of location in Ephesians? One reason could be </p>
<p>because he is speaking about the vastness of God’s power and the reach of </p>
<p>Christ’s redemptive work—even over the powers in the heavenly realms </p>
<p>(3:10; 6:12). He argues that Christ has attained the victory over all powers </p>
<p>and forces, and this victory is demonstrated through the church and each </p>
<p>believer’s faithful stand in Christ. Such a claim would sound particularly </p>
<p>audacious to the average Ephesian who had in their own city one of the </p>
<p>seven wonders of the ancient world, the Temple of Artemis. ey would </p>
<p>also see the pageantry of the imperial cult, and reect on the vastness of </p>
<p>the Empire’s power, and scratch their heads at statements such as Paul </p>
<p>makes here. Ironically today, only a single column from Artemis’ grand </p>
<p>edice stands as a solitary witness amidst a swamp-like setting, crowned </p>
<p>with a stork’s nest. And great temples to the emperors survive only as </p>
<p>scattered pieces of marble and a few arches hinting at their former glory.</p>
<p>Chosen through Christ (1:4–6)</p>
<p>A closer look at 1:4–6 shows a tightly packaged argument that stresses </p>
<p>God’s blessing which was lavishly extended. e key noun is grace; it is </p>
<p>God’s grace that manifests his blessing, it is God’s grace that is so proli-</p>
<p>cally bestowed. Paul explains that it was always God’s plan to redeem his </p>
<p>world through the Lord Jesus Christ; indeed it was God’s good pleasure </p>
<p>that informed his will. An astonishing number of parallels are found with </p>
<p>Rom 8, including specic concepts such as predestination, sonship, and </p>
