<p>how Jesus might have taught.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>But he then goes on to reject that possibility</p>
<p>as it pertains to Christ. Finally, Clement of Alexandria uses the concept, </p>
<p>even citing the example similar to the one noted above of a physician’s </p>
<p>practice.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>He suggests that such was also used by Paul in circumcising</p>
<p>Timothy, but in the end he says that he cannot accept the label of deceit; </p>
<p>Paul was accommodating to the Jewish sensibilities, not being deceitful. </p>
<p>Interestingly, Chrysostom, in his long explanation to his friend about his </p>
<p>apparent duplicity, also notes Paul’s circumcision of Timothy, and likewise </p>
<p>rejects a label of deception. In any case, while these few church fathers do </p>
<p>acknowledge the noble falsehood as a possible reality in their daily lives, </p>
<p>they do not accept it as the modus operandi for apostles and Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>It seems, then, that the early believers would not have countenanced a </p>
<p>pseudepigraphic letter on the grounds it that was a noble falsehood.</p>
<p>Evidence from the Early Church</p>
<p>e early church resisted accepting as authoritative anything beyond the </p>
<p>apostolic period, such as the Acts of Paul.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> For example, in the h cen-</p>
<p>tury, the presbyter Salvian wrote Timothei ad Ecclesiam (libri IV). e </p>
<p>local bishop guessed that his presbyter was responsible, and protested the </p>
<p>writing. Salvian responded that he knew who wrote it (he denied respon-</p>
<p>sibility), and that he felt it necessary to attach an authoritative name to </p>
<p>the work, for otherwise no one would read it. Moreover, Salvian asserted </p>
<p>the author was being humble by not attaching his name. And anyway, </p>
<p>the name Timothy was chosen as a play on words, for it means “honor of </p>
<p>God.” Salvian wanted it both ways, to say that people read it because of </p>
<p>the reputed author, and that the name means nothing. At bottom, Salvian </p>
<p>(the likely author) used the name Timothy to deceive the readers, and his </p>
<p>bishop denounced it. e problem is addressed from a dierent angle in </p>
<p>Eusebius’ discussion of Dionysius, bishop of Corinth (ca. 170 CE), who </p>
<p>commented that his epistles had been defaced. “As the brethren desired </p>
<p>me to write epistles, I wrote. And these epistles the apostles of the devil </p>
<p>have lled with tares, cutting out some things and adding others. For </p>
<p>34. Origen Cels. 4.19.</p>
<p>35. Clement of Alexandria Strom. 7.53.</p>
<p>36. e issues surrounding the rejection of the Acts of Paul are complex, but in the </p>
<p>mix is the belief that it was written in the second century, aer the apostolic period, and </p>
<p>thus not meriting the highest level of authority within the church.</p>
