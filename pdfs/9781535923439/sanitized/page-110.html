<p>tudes of believers. Second, Paul focuses on the renewed self, that which is </p>
<p>being transformed daily (2 Cor 4:16). Paul has in mind that aspect of the </p>
<p>person that is attuned to God (Rom 7:22). e esh, that which is part of </p>
<p>this present age, will fade away. e new self, the inner person, however, </p>
<p>is being transformed by the reality of new life in Christ. ird, Paul is not </p>
<p>indicating with this phrase that a believer’s faith is private. e inner per-</p>
<p>son strengthened by God’s Spirit is a dierent social, communal, public </p>
<p>person—as Paul will outline in chs. 4–6. Finally, Paul drives home the </p>
<p>point that the Christian life is powered by the Spirit. Today we might say </p>
<p>that Christians run on electricity, not on batteries. God has not designed </p>
<p>a motor that once he turns it on will run on its own. Instead, it needs a </p>
<p>constant current, which is the Spirit.</p>
<p>Not only does Paul ask that they be strengthened, but also that they </p>
<p>might have Christ dwell in their hearts through faith (3:17). It is possible </p>
<p>that Paul suggests here that the strengthening of the inner person will </p>
<p>lead to Christ taking up habitation in believers’ hearts. But more likely </p>
<p>Paul is paralleling this phrase with his request that through the Spirit the </p>
<p>believers will be strong. As we have seen in several places in Ephesians </p>
<p>thus far (1:12–13; 2:16–18; see also 4:3–6), Paul presents a vision of the </p>
<p>Trinity, in this case working actively within believers that they might ex-</p>
<p>perience the fullness of God. In the nal clause of this verse, Paul states </p>
<p>that the believers have been established in love, a phrase that both glances </p>
<p>back and looks forward in the prayer. is passage bridges his comment </p>
<p>that Christ dwells in their hearts, for they have been rooted in love from </p>
<p>the moment they were in Christ. But it also looks forward by oering a </p>
<p>rm foundation, namely love, from which knowledge is possible.</p>
<p>Verses 3:18–19 include Paul’s requests that the Ephesians might have </p>
<p>the strength and the knowledge to see the universe as it really is and know </p>
<p>Christ’s love. Paul turns his attention to describing how his previous re-</p>
<p>quest, that God grant them strength and Christ’s indwelling, will impact </p>
<p>the Ephesians. He prays that they will be, by God’s grace, supernaturally </p>
<p>strong in their minds and hearts to comprehend the spiritual realities of </p>
<p>God’s love, power, and grace. Paul uses words of measurement—deep, </p>
<p>wide, high, and long—but does not indicate what he is describing. is </p>
<p>has led to several theories. Jerome and Augustine argue that Paul is de-</p>
<p>scribing the cross.</p>

<p>is idea has much to commend itself, including its</p>
