<p>Ephesians 1:3–14</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>1:5 that God predestined us to sonship, he is explaining the goal of the </p>
<p>predestined decision. Again, in 1:9b–10 Paul claries that God’s purpose </p>
<p>in Christ was to bring his plan to accomplishment, namely the uniting or </p>
<p>summing up of all things in Christ.</p>
<p>Blessings (1:3)</p>
<p>Verse three is Paul’s thesis statement, which sets up his argument in the </p>
<p>remaining ten verses. ree times Paul uses the Greek noun or verb cog-</p>
<p>nate for “blessing” (from which we get our English word “eulogy”): God </p>
<p>is the blessed one; he is the one who blessed us with all spiritual bless-</p>
<p>ings. e full character of the Truine God is hinted at in the passage as </p>
<p>well, for Paul notes that these blessings come from the Lord Jesus Christ’s </p>
<p>God and Father. Moreover, these blessings are spiritual blessings, and this </p>
<p>adjective is eshed out in 1:13 when we read of the promised Holy Spirit </p>
<p>marking believers as their seal and assurance of redemption. e spiritual </p>
<p>blessings are from/of/pertaining to the Holy Spirit; we should avoid the </p>
<p>modern assumption that spiritual is limited to the non-physical realm </p>
and personal piety of individuals. It is God the Father’s work in God the
<p>Son, armed in God the Holy Spirit, which Paul sets out to demonstrate </p>
<p>in the remaining ten verses. Declaring God as Father evoked in the an-</p>
<p>cient world ideas of belonging to a family, of authority within the family, </p>
<p>and responsibilities to raise upright and virtuous children. Both Jewish </p>
<p>and Gentile fathers were expected to provide for their children. Today, </p>
<p>however, identifying God as Father has come under sharp criticism, for </p>
<p>at least two reasons. In some cases, the inadequacies, if not downright </p>
<p>criminal behavior, of some fathers towards their children has emptied the </p>
<p>term of all goodness. In other cases, fatherhood has been understood to </p>
<p>emphasize maleness over against femaleness. We must note that the point </p>
<p>here is not to promote fatherhood over motherhood. Moreover, the char-</p>
<p>acteristics of God the Father are not limited to males, nor does Paul make </p>
<p>the point that God is male; indeed the characteristics include love, mercy, </p>
<p>grace, care, and responsibility toward children, oen characteristics we </p>
<p>associate today with women. In 1:17 Paul speaks of the father of glory, </p>
<p>with the adjective “glory” summing up all the attributes of the Father just </p>
<p>discussed in the eulogy: redemption of a people to be to the praise of his </p>
<p>glory. When Paul speaks of Christ and God (Father) in terms of the re-</p>
<p>demptive work of Christ, as in 1 Cor 3:23; 11:3; 15:28, there is in view the </p>
