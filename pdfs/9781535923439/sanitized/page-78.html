<p>Ephesians 2:1–10</p>

<p>from falsehood (idols). But because both Jews and Gentiles ultimately sin </p>
<p>by either following the gods of this world or their own eshly desires, the </p>
<p>end result is that all are in need of God’s grace. e transgressions might </p>
<p>look dierent, one pursuing idolatry, another lusts of the esh, but both </p>
<p>paths take one far from the center of God’s love. at is why Paul can </p>
<p>also say that both we (Jews) and all the rest of humanity were children of </p>
<p>wrath by nature (2:3). e emphasis is not on how each group came to </p>
<p>such a situation (original sin discussion) or on whether people have been </p>
<p>created for wrath (double predestination discussion). Rather, Paul’s focus </p>
<p>is on what state humanity is in at the present: they are under the power </p>
<p>of sin and death.</p>
<p>Verb Tenses in Paul’s Argument</p>
<p>Returning to the main verbs in 2:5–6, Paul describes God’s actions to-</p>
<p>wards believers who were once dead in trespasses as having made them </p>
<p>alive with Christ, raised them with Christ, and seated them with Christ. </p>
<p>Paul uses the past tense (aorist), which some suggest speaks against </p>
<p>Pauline authorship. ey argue that Paul focused on the future hope we </p>
<p>have in Christ. e point Paul makes here, however, is that believers are </p>
<p>with Christ, and so if they are with him, then they will share his current </p>
<p>status and situation. Since Christ was indeed raised from the dead, if we </p>
<p>are then with him, we share that resurrection status (see Col 2:12; 3:1). </p>
<p>e reality of the resurrection life does not begin at Christ’s second com-</p>
<p>ing, it is occurring right now. Oen in Pauline studies this eschatology </p>
<p>is identied as a “now, not yet” position. Now in Christ we have all we </p>
<p>need for living a holy life in the power of the Spirit, but yet to come is the </p>
<p>resurrected body and new heavens and earth. And over all this is the real-</p>
<p>ity that because we are in Christ, we share with Christ all the blessings of </p>
<p>God through Christ. Such language is found in Rom 6:8, where Paul uses </p>
<p>the future tense to speak about our hope in Christ, and past tense in Rom </p>
<p>8:30 to describe our standing in Christ as predestined, called, justied, </p>
<p>and gloried.</p>
<p>Salvation Is God’s Gi</p>
<p>Paul insists that God’s grace is what provides salvation. In 2:8 he contin-</p>
<p>ues his claim in 2:5, “by grace you have been saved,” with the additional </p>
