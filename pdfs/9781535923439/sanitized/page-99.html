<p>Paul, a Servant</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>abnormally born” (1 Cor 15:8). e Greek term carries the sense of a </p>
<p>spontaneously aborted fetus, misshapen and deformed. Nonetheless, he </p>
<p>declares, God’s grace to him is not in vain. So too here to the Ephesians, </p>
<p>Paul contrasts his own unworthiness with the superior grace extended to </p>
<p>him by God for the task of preaching to the Gentiles. Paul reinforces his </p>
<p>conviction that the message of redemption is not based on his personal </p>
<p>skills, but on the wealth of God’s grace expressed in Paul’s gospel message. </p>
<p>In sum, Paul’s hope to persuade his readers in chs. 4–6 to change their </p>
<p>behavior or continue along the path of right living would be seriously </p>
<p>compromised if he could not generate motivation for change. Paul’s re-</p>
<p>ection on his ministry and his imprisonment serves the very necessary </p>
<p>purpose of establishing an intimate relationship with his readers.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Paul the Servant</p>
<p>Paul declares himself a servant in 3:7. Since the 1970s, it has been popular </p>
<p>to think of Christian leaders as “servant leaders.” However, the term was </p>
<p>coined by a business consultant, Robert Greenleaf, to promote a less auto-</p>
<p>cratic corporation environment. Many in the church took over the term, using </p>
<p>it to explain what biblical leadership looks like. But is this term best suited </p>
<p>to describe what the Bible means about service, about leadership? Note that </p>
<p>Paul does not describe himself as a servant leader. Nowhere in Eph 3 does he </p>
<p>mention leadership, generally understood as giving orders or making decisions </p>
<p>for the group. Instead, Paul stresses that a certain grace was extended to him </p>
<p>for a speciﬁc purpose, namely to preach the mystery now made known, that </p>
<p>Gentiles are co-heirs with Jews in Christ. This message was revealed to the </p>
<p>apostles and prophets (3:5). Interestingly, Paul does not include himself as a </p>
<p>member of this group, although he does identify himself as an apostle in 1:1. </p>
<p>Perhaps in 3:5 Paul is thinking of the earliest apostles and prophets who knew </p>
<p>Jesus’ earthly ministry. This group is called upon as corroborating evidence </p>
<p>for Paul’s gospel claims. Additionally, I think Paul is teasing out his own view </p>
<p>of apostleship, namely that it involves not leadership per se, but service of </p>
<p>the most menial sort—such as seemingly wasting away chained to a Roman </p>
<p>soldier. Such servant behavior shows most clearly the powerful grace of God, </p>
<p>and it gloriﬁes those whom it serves.</p>
