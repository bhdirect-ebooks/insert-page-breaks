<p>Ephesians 4:1–6</p>

<p>the Gentile Roman world of Ephesus. Indeed, well-known philosophers </p>
<p>such as Epictetus (50–130 CE) disparage humility as dishonorable for </p>
<p>a free person to display, for it debases them in the eyes of their peers.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yet according to Paul, humility is an appropriate posture for believers, </p>
<p>because they do not compare themselves to others but see themselves as </p>
<p>servants of God.</p>
<p>Gentleness is the second attitude noted by Paul; Jesus is described as </p>
<p>gentle of heart (Matt 11:29), and Paul uses both humility and gentleness </p>
<p>in describing Christ (2 Cor 10:1). In Gal 5:23, the characteristic is among </p>
<p>the fruit of the Spirit. Gentleness was viewed more positively by the wider </p>
<p>Roman world. e term carried the sense of the middle ground between </p>
<p>constant anger at everyone and no anger at all. It also had the sense of </p>
<p>a trainer taming a wild horse. In any case, it does not have the sense of </p>
<p>being weak in the face of struggle or lacking courage. Finally, Paul speaks </p>
<p>of patience (see also a list of the fruit of the Spirit in Gal 5:22). Together </p>
<p>these character traits can be thought of as the necessary traveler’s kit for </p>
<p>all believers as they embark on their journey of faith. To be faithful to </p>
<p>their calling, to express Christian love, to model unity requires the super-</p>
<p>natural grace oered by God in Christ through the Spirit, witnessed by </p>
<p>the one baptism and one faith shared by all believers.</p>
<p>e oneness in love that should characterize the church is rooted </p>
<p>in the gospel claims about the God who calls (see also 1 Cor 1:26). In </p>
<p>1:18, Paul speaks of the hope of our calling that believers might ever more </p>
<p>deeply understand and appreciate the riches of God’s salvation. e hope </p>
<p>of the calling is that all things will be summed up in Christ (1:10), includ-</p>
<p>ing overcoming both humanity’s estrangement from God and creation’s </p>
<p>decay. It is through the invitation that God calls, and his call reects his </p>
<p>purposes in his redemption plan (Rom 9:11). A foretaste of that hope </p>
<p>fully realized is the unity between Jew and Gentile in the church. If you </p>
<p>need proof that our resurrection hope will be actualized fully in God’s </p>
<p>time, just look at the church, created through the death and resurrection </p>
<p>of Christ and united in Christ through the Spirit. While we don’t always </p>
<p>see this unity within our churches today, the fact of the matter is that the </p>
<p>power that raised Jesus is the same power that made Gentiles members of </p>
<p>God’s family. Christ is our peace, and Paul suggests that one sure way to </p>
