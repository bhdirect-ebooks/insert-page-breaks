<p>Introduction</p>

<p>Finally, we must raise the obvious question: Why would Paul send a </p>
<p>letter to the Ephesians, or even to satellite churches surrounding Ephesus, </p>
<p>if he was imprisoned in their midst? Or from another angle, if he was </p>
<p>unable to speak with the Ephesian Christians, one would presume that </p>
<p>he would lack the liberty to write to them. Either way, if Paul was in an </p>
<p>Ephesus jail, it seems highly unlikely that he would choose to write to the </p>
<p>church in that very same city. Indeed those who postulate an Ephesus </p>
<p>locale for Colossians and Philemon generally suggest a Rome venue for </p>
<p>Ephesians, precisely because it is so dicult to explain why Paul would </p>
<p>write when he could presumably speak directly with the Ephesian church. </p>
<p>e similar statements in Ephesians and Colossians about Tychicus deliv-</p>
<p>ering the letters are usually explained as the author of Ephesians copying </p>
<p>from Paul’s letter to the Colossians.</p>
<p>Rome Imprisonment</p>
<p>at leaves Rome as the most likely spot for Paul’s imprisonment in com-</p>
<p>posing the four prison epistles. e major roadblock raised against this </p>
<p>theory is the length of time it would take to make a journey from Rome to </p>
<p>Philippi, Ephesus, or Colossae. At this point we should note that Philippi </p>
<p>and Ephesus were major cities in themselves; Ephesus was the largest and </p>
<p>most important city in Asia Minor, and Philippi was a Roman colony. </p>
<p>us travel between these cities and Rome by all manner of traders, </p>
<p>government ocials, and military personnel would have been frequent. </p>
<p>Assuming the typical distance of 15–20 miles per day on foot, it would </p>
<p>take the average traveler from Rome to Philippi about two or three weeks </p>
<p>to traverse the 360 miles to the eastern Italian port city of Brundisium, </p>
<p>then two days to sail to Greece (perhaps the port cities of Dyrrachium or </p>
<p>Aulona), with the nal 370 miles of the journey along the Via Egnatia (the </p>
<p>superhighway of the day) to Philippi taking about another two weeks. e </p>
<p>800 miles could be covered in about a month and a half. Alternatively, </p>
<p>Paul’s envoy traveling to Ephesus might take a boat from Italy to Corinth, </p>
<p>then on to Ephesus. is route would take one to two weeks from Rome </p>
<p>to Corinth, and then another week to Ephesus, but so much depended </p>
<p>upon the winds.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>e time involved, then, in traveling to Rome from</p>
<p>either Ephesus or Philippi was not appreciably more than traveling on </p>
