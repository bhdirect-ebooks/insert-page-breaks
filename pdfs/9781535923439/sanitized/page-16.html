<p>Introduction</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>comments reect the general Christian debate about the nature of the </p>
<p>church, which has continued through the centuries and relies in large </p>
<p>part on Paul’s understanding of the church expressed in Ephesians. As </p>
<p>these three examples show, Ephesians covers key foundational aspects </p>
<p>of the gospel, including Christology, pneumatology, soteriology, escha-</p>
<p>tology, and ecclesiology. To these we might add the modern questions </p>
<p>of authorship and the social roles described in chapter 5. In Ephesians </p>
<p>we nd much to reect upon as God’s plan of redemption, and our own </p>
<p>part in the story, is laid before us. e rst chapter of Ephesians presents </p>
<p>with rhetorical ourish and fanfare the praise rightly due to the one true </p>
<p>God, Father, Son, and Spirit. e stage lights are rst focused on God the </p>
<p>Father, who chose to redeem the world for his good purposes, including </p>
<p>creating a people unto himself in Christ. In chapter 2 the spotlight grows </p>
<p>to include more fully the role of Christ Jesus in the plan of salvation, and </p>
<p>with chapter 3 the stage is ooded with light, revealing the activities of </p>
<p>the Holy Spirit in accomplishing the goals of salvation within the church. </p>
<p>e nal three chapters direct attention to the church, this new creation </p>
<p>based on the work of Christ and empowered by the Spirit for God’s glory. </p>
<p>Why start with the Trinity? Whatever Paul’s reason, it has the eect of re-</p>
<p>inforcing the amazingly simple, but profound truth that God is the center </p>
<p>of the universe. Not my salvation, not my social justice concerns, not my </p>
<p>doctrines on ecclesiology or eschatology; God is the center, the beginning </p>
<p>and the end. e tremendous idea—Paul trips over his words to make </p>
<p>sense of it—is that the majestic God has determined in our time to make </p>
<p>known his salvation plan in Christ. rough the Spirit, he set in motion </p>
<p>the salvation plan for a new creation and the full realization of the king-</p>
<p>dom of God. If we start with Ephesians in our quest to understand the </p>
<p>gospel as Paul outlines it (instead of starting with Romans, for example, </p>
<p>although the two letters share quite a bit in common), we might register </p>
<p>aspects of Paul’s message that have been mued or ignored. For example, </p>
<p>Ephesians stresses God’s grace in the forgiveness of sins for the purpose of </p>
<p>building a new community, a holy temple dedicated to God’s glory. God </p>
<p>acted in Christ through the Spirit to make a new creation, which includes </p>
<p>personal forgiveness of sins so that a people (Jew and Gentile, slave and </p>
<p>free, male and female) might be made into a new household of God for </p>
<p>his glory.</p>
<p>ough dicult to reduce such a complex argument as we nd </p>
<p>in Ephesians into a single sentence, a possible statement might be that </p>
