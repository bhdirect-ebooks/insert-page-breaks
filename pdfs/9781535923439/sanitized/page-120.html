<p>Ephesians 4:7–16</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>permeate this passage. e images are full of motion as Paul presents the </p>
<p>ignorant as thrown about by winds and waves, and the wise as standing </p>
<p>fast against the gale. Verse 16 circles back to v. 7 by concluding that each </p>
<p>member grows in love and together with other members makes up the </p>
<p>maturing body of Christ.</p>
<p>In 4:7 Paul speaks of the grace given to each of us according to the </p>
<p>measure of Christ’s gi (“the” is not translated in the TNIV). is verse </p>
<p>has given rise to several interpretations, in part because certain terms, </p>
<p>including measure, grace, and gi, carry a range of meaning. Before ex-</p>
<p>ploring possible meanings of these terms, we should note what the state-</p>
<p>ment does not imply. Paul is not claiming that God gives more salvation </p>
<p>grace to some than to others, or that he limits his grace to some but not </p>
<p>to others. Jerome uses an interesting analogy.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>He likens the grace of God</p>
<p>to the waters of the sea, which to humans appear innite. Picture a scene </p>
<p>wherein a person stood knee deep in the ocean, and many came to him </p>
<p>with vessels to be lled with seawater. He could only give as much seawa-</p>
ter as those individuals could hold, while all around them the sea waves
<p>lapped. e supply was endless, but the vessels were nite. So too, the </p>
<p>grace of Christ is innite, and is poured into nite humans. Nor does the </p>
<p>phrase imply that some believers have more grace to live their daily lives </p>
<p>than do others. Christ’s grace is unfathomable.</p>
<p>Returning to contested terms, dictionary denitions of metron or </p>
<p>“apportionment” include (a) a standard, rule, or means of measurement, </p>
<p>(b) a certain portion in contrast to another amount, and (c) quantity, size, </p>
<p>or length. e various interpretations of “measure” are not given in isola-</p>
<p>tion of decisions about the meaning of grace and gi in 4:7. Oen the gi </p>
<p>noted in 4:7 is related to the list of leaders in 4:11. e argument contends </p>
<p>that the gi given by Christ is the special levels of grace or the abilities </p>
<p>that include apostles, prophets, and so on. us the phrase “according to </p>
<p>the measure of the gi of Christ” means that each believer gets a gi and </p>
<p>Christ determines the amount of the gi. However, the focus in 4:11 is </p>
<p>not on giving gis to particular people, but Christ out of his abundance </p>
<p>granting aid to the church. I will say more about this below; here let me </p>
<p>note a few points. First, the term “gi” is singular in 4:7, while the listing </p>
<p>of that which Christ gives in 4:11 contains several items. Second, Paul </p>
<p>includes himself in 4:7 when he says “to each of us.” is suggests one </p>
