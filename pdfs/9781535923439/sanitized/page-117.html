<p>Fusing the Horizons: Paul’s Sermons and Letters</p>
<p>Paul’s farewell address to the Ephesians in Acts 20:18–35 gets scant atten-</p>
<p>tion in commentaries on Ephesians, in large part because the epistle’s Pauline </p>
<p>authorship is questioned. Even if Pauline authorship is granted, the second </p>
<p>hurdle is Luke’s reliability in presenting Paul’s speech. We have already dealt </p>
<p>with the authorship question extensively in the Introduction. Some call into </p>
<p>question the authenticity of Luke’s rendering of Paul’s speech, but in favor of </p>
<p>its reliability is its placement in Miletus, not Ephesus. This relatively insigniﬁ-</p>
<p>cant venue supports the speech’s historicity. Others argue that Luke is a trust-</p>
<p>worthy preserver of Paul’s essential message, even if the wording is Lukan, by </p>
<p>pointing to the topics in this speech and similar themes found within Paul’s </p>
<p>epistles. For example, these terms are used in both: “gospel,” “grace,” as well </p>
<p>as the phrase “faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.” Paul emphasizes that he spoke </p>
<p>to both Jews and Gentiles (Acts 20:21) and that he faced trials in Ephesus </p>
<p>(see also 1 Cor 15:32). Both in Acts 20:28 and in Eph 1:7, he emphasizes </p>
<p>the blood of Christ which brings forgiveness of sins; additionally, he speaks </p>
<p>of the building up of the body (Eph 2:20–22; Acts 20:32). He notes that </p>
<p>he worked hard among them, not taking any free handouts. This information </p>
<p>was not part of Luke’s account of Paul’s journeys, but is scattered throughout </p>
<p>Paul’s letters (1 Thess 2:9; 1 Cor 9:12); in Eph 4:28 he encourages them not </p>
<p>to steal, but to work hard that they might be able to take care of needs in their </p>
<p>midst. Again, Paul stresses that the Ephesians have an inheritance because </p>
<p>they are sanctiﬁed (Eph 1:18, Acts 20:32). What we ﬁnd in Paul’s farewell </p>
<p>address to the Ephesians is consistent with his letter to them. In both Paul </p>
<p>exhorts them to remain steadfast, reminds them of his own work among them, </p>
<p>reiterates to them that they (Jew and Gentile) share an inheritance in Christ, </p>
<p>and encourages them in the building up of the body of Christ.</p>
<p>It is not by accident that Paul connects in his mind Jesus’ teachings and </p>
<p>the term humility, for this characteristic is distinctive of Christianity, not </p>
