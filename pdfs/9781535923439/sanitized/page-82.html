<p>Ephesians 2:1–10</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>God’s Masterpiece</p>
<p>e nal verse (2:10) in this section directs the believer’s vision from the </p>
<p>heavenly realm into the world, and oers the second ramication con-</p>
cerning our salvation in Christ. e believers have a purpose, divinely given and divinely empowered: to function as God’s agents of goodness
<p>in the world. To fully appreciate Paul’s argument, we need to focus on sev-</p>
<p>eral key terms in this verse, including his description of believers as God’s </p>
<p>masterpiece or handiwork and the good works laid out before them. And </p>
<p>we need to address the idea of works as it relates to believers’ lives of </p>
<p>faith.</p>
<p>To the rst point, Paul describes believers as God’s masterpiece or </p>
<p>handiwork. e term was used in the larger Greek world to speak of cre-</p>
<p>ative accomplishments such as composing a poem. e term carries an </p>
<p>exalted meaning. For example, both canoes and yacht are boats, but only </p>
<p>the latter would qualify as the kind of masterpiece of creativity Paul is </p>
<p>signaling here. Paul has been building to this crescendo for nine verses. In </p>
<p>this section, Paul has described believers’ pasts as one of death, drowning </p>
<p>under the weight of eshly passions, suocating under the power of the </p>
<p>ruler of the air. All that changes in Christ; believers are greatly loved by </p>
<p>God, given the gi of salvation, saved by grace, made alive with Christ, </p>
<p>raised and seated with Christ in the heavenlies. It takes one’s breath away; </p>
<p>no wonder Paul declares that we are God’s masterpiece, for God’s love, </p>
<p>care and glory come together in our salvation.</p>
<p>Connected with the term “handiwork” or masterpiece is the verb “to </p>
<p>create.” God’s work in us can be summed up as new creation. e verb </p>
<p>is used only with God as the subject in the New Testament, and it can </p>
<p>reference either physical or spiritual creation. e two words are used </p>
<p>together here to speak of the believer’s new life in Christ, but they are </p>
<p>found together in Rom 1:20, which speaks of God’s physical creation of </p>
<p>the world. We will return to the subject of physical creation in a moment, </p>
<p>but we cannot overestimate the importance for Paul of the concept of </p>
<p>new creation. Paul insists to the Corinthians that each of them is a new </p>
<p>creation in Christ, using the noun form of the verb. e context is that of </p>
<p>recognizing that all humans die, and Christ died for all. us if one has </p>
<p>died in Christ, then that one is a new creation (2 Cor 5:14–17). e phrase </p>
<p>“new creation” is found in Gal 6:15, but here the contrast is between those </p>
<p>who advocate circumcision of the esh, and those who cling to the cross. </p>
