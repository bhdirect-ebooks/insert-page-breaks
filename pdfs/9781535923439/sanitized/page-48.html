<p>structing the recipients. Such an approach is similar to 1 Peter, James, </p>
<p>or Hebrews, letters whose addressees are unspecied in terms of a city. </p>
<p>Judging by the content of the letter itself, several tentative conclusions can </p>
<p>be drawn about the audience receiving this letter. Unlike his tension-lled </p>
<p>letter to the Galatians, in this epistle Paul is comfortable with the con-</p>
<p>gregation. ey are on good terms, and Paul feels his time among them </p>
<p>has been eective (1 Cor 16:9). But that does not mean that Paul’s time </p>
<p>in Ephesus was one long holiday. Paul informs the Corinthians of serious </p>
<p>struggles and suering he endured in Ephesus, and Acts describes the </p>
<p>riot that ared up surrounding Paul’s teaching and healing. It seems prob-</p>
<p>able that the Ephesian Christians faced similar hostility, though not of </p>
<p>the same magnitude. Both the Philippian and the essalonian churches </p>
<p>faced serious persecutions, and Acts indicates that Paul was persecuted </p>
<p>harshly in both cities. e same pattern likely existed in Ephesus.</p>
<p>First Corinthians gives us a window into at least a few members of </p>
<p>the Ephesian church. Paul wrote 1 Corinthians from Ephesus (1 Cor 16:8) </p>
<p>and his coauthor was Sosthenes (1 Cor 1:1). Was this the same person </p>
<p>who in Acts was a leader in the synagogue in Corinth? e fact that Paul </p>
<p>oers no introduction beyond the label “brother” suggests that Sosthenes </p>
<p>was well known to the Corinthians, lending weight to the conclusion </p>
<p>that this person met Paul in Corinth, and traveled with him to Ephesus. </p>
Paul notes that some people from Chloe reported divisions within the
<p>Corinthian church. We know precious little about these people, or Chloe </p>
<p>for that matter. e strongest suggestion is that they were outsiders to the </p>
<p>local Christian community because they brought what Paul evaluates as </p>
<p>unbiased information. We could reasonably surmise that Chloe’s people </p>
<p>(and perhaps Chloe herself) were members of the Ephesian church. In </p>
<p>the nal chapter he mentions Timothy coming to the Corinthians, pre-</p>
<p>sumably from Ephesus. He also notes the presence of Apollos, who was </p>
<p>not anxious to travel to Corinth in the immediate future, and we might </p>
<p>assume that he remained in Ephesus. From 2 Cor 2:4 and 7:6–11 we learn </p>
<p>that Titus was with Paul in Ephesus, and took his “tearful” letter to them. </p>
<p>Finally Paul makes special mention of Aquila and Priscilla and the church </p>
<p>meeting in their home in 1 Cor 16:19. is Jewish couple is described in </p>
<p>Acts (18:2) as originally coming to Corinth from Rome (being expelled </p>
<p>under Emperor Claudius). Paul shared their profession (tent making or </p>
<p>leather working), and lived with them. Aer eighteen months, all three </p>
