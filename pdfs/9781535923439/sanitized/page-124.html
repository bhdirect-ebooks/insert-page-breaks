<p>persuasive approach. A negative response to the question looks forward </p>
<p>to 4:12, suggesting that Paul’s point is that Christ gives particular aids </p>
<p>to the church, so that the saints can do the ministry to which they are </p>
<p>called. It is crucial to note that what Christ gives, he gives to the church. </p>
<p>We might imagine Christ handing out a gi box to his body, containing </p>
<p>the vitamins it needs to grow strong. e focus is on saints equipped for </p>
ministry and church growth, not on individuals receiving special giing.
<p>e advantage of this appraisal is that it is a more straightforward read of </p>
<p>the Greek.</p>
<p>Second, 4:12 lists three prepositional phrases, and their relationship </p>
<p>to each other, as well as to the preceding verse, has given rise to two com-</p>
<p>peting interpretations. e phrases in Greek are “for [pros] the equipping </p>
<p>of the saints,” “to [eis] the work of ministry,” and “to [eis] the building </p>
<p>of the body of Christ.” For two main reasons, one position understands </p>
<p>the rst clause as primary, and the second clause in a subordinate posi-</p>
<p>tion (see the TNIV translation above). First, the dierent prepositions </p>
<p>signal that the clauses are not of equal weight. Second, Paul uses a noun </p>
<p>(katartismos) in the rst clause that is not found elsewhere in the New </p>
<p>Testament, but whose cognate verb occurs frequently and is translated as </p>
<p>“equipping” or “perfecting.” Choosing the rst option, the phrase would </p>
<p>read “equipping the saints,” which raises the question: equipping them for </p>
<p>what? e answer, indicated by the preposition eis, is for the work of the </p>
<p>ministry. is position argues that the gi given to the church is for the </p>
<p>saints to be equipped to do their ministry, which is to build up the church. </p>
<p>e saints are equipped in their tasks by the gi, namely the apostles, </p>
<p>prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers who instruct the saints and </p>
<p>nurture the body of Christ. is argument ts well not only in accounting </p>
<p>for the dierent prepositions, but also with Paul’s overarching emphasis </p>
<p>that the gi and Christ’s riches are given to every member of Christ’s body </p>
<p>(Eph 1:3–19; 3:20).</p>
<p>e second position argues that each of the prepositional phrases </p>
<p>is independent of the other two, and all three refer back to the responsi-</p>
<p>bilities and activities of the apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and </p>
<p>teachers. In this interpretation, the noun katartismos is translated as </p>
<p>“perfecting” or “training” the saints. “e primary context here in v. 12 </p>
<p>is the function and role of Christ’s specic gis, the ministers, not that of </p>
