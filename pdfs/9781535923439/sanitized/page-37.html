<p>Introduction</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>the Neo-Pythagoreans, were usually produced by a school, or at least sev-</p>
<p>eral hands are evident in the nal redaction. Indeed, ancient commenta-</p>
<p>tors pointed out that Pythagoras was known to have written little himself, </p>
<p>but much of his surviving work is the result of his disciples’ careful note </p>
<p>taking. For example, Porphyry (second-century CE Neoplatonist) notes </p>
<p>that of the 280 works with Pythagoras’ name attached, only 80 are from </p>
<p>the philosopher directly; the others were written by his disciples. is fact </p>
<p>was not troubling because, as Iamblichus (Neoplatonist, ca. 250–325 CE) </p>
<p>observes, it was their custom to sign everything in their master’s name. </p>
<p>Olympiodorus (sixth-century CE Neoplatonist) notes that Pythagoras did </p>
<p>not leave any personal writings behind because he believed his “spiritual” </p>
<p>writings, his disciples, were a better source for hearing his philosophy. </p>
<p>ese students out of goodwill for their esteemed teacher wrote down </p>
<p>his teachings from their notes. Pythagoras is thus somewhat distinctive </p>
<p>in that he chose not to write but instructed his students to do so. We </p>
<p>have no record of Paul making a similar request, and of course, Paul also </p>
<p>wrote some letters. But if someone wrote in Cicero’s name, or Seneca’s, </p>
<p>they faced condemnation, because the purpose of writing such a letter </p>
<p>was either the real author’s personal gain or the disgrace of the important </p>
<p>gure. e physician Galen (second century CE) laments that his works </p>
<p>were redacted in inappropriate and lazy ways that violated his literary </p>
<p>property. He wrote On His Own Books in an attempt to stem the tide </p>
<p>of these inferior works, wherein he recounts an incident that highlights </p>
<p>his frustration over forgeries and unscrupulous editors. He explains that </p>
<p>a group had gathered in a bookshop and was discussing the authentic-</p>
<p>ity of one of his books. A fellow steps forward, reads the rst couple of </p>
<p>lines, and tosses it aside as fake, because it was evident that it was not </p>
<p>Galen’s style.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>Likewise Quintilian says he published only one of his court</p>
<p>orations; however, to his great dismay, the court stenographers, having </p>
<p>recorded what was said, later took his ideas and expressed them in their </p>
<p>own words.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> Quintilian felt he should have the rights to publish his spo-</p>
<p>ken word, that his orations were not part of public domain.</p>
<p>What troubled these authors and others was not simply that some-</p>
<p>one might gain nancially from this deception, but that the entire corpus </p>
<p>of their work, their ideas and reputation, could be smeared or lowered </p>
