<p>Closing Remarks</p>
<p>161</p>
<p>Ephesians is deutero-Pauline. is conclusion has been critiqued in the </p>
<p>Introduction; we might note here that since the two letters were written </p>
<p>about the same time, sent to the same general area, and taken by the same </p>
<p>courier, repeating a similar description of the letter handler was an act of </p>
<p>common sense. Paul was eager for them to hear directly about his situ-</p>
<p>ation by someone who had been present with him in his imprisonment. </p>
<p>e Ephesians apparently were concerned about Paul, as indicated by his </p>
<p>response in 3:13. A curiosity is the addition of the term “also” (kai) in </p>
<p>6:21, “that you may also know.” To what is Paul referring? Most likely he is </p>
<p>alluding to other letters being sent at this time (Colossians, for example).</p>
<p>We meet Tychicus in ve separate places in the biblical texts: Eph </p>
<p>6:21; Col 4:7; Acts 20:4; 2 Tim 4:12; Titus 3:12. He and Trophimus are </p>
<p>the two from Asia who accompany Paul when he leaves Ephesus aer the </p>
<p>riot and heads through Macedonia to Greece and back again on his way </p>
<p>to Jerusalem. In an interesting note, Luke tells us that Jews from Asia see </p>
<p>Trophimus in Jerusalem, and assume that Paul has taken him into the </p>
<p>restricted area of the Jerusalem temple (Acts 21:27–30). Luke identies </p>
<p>Trophimus as from Ephesus (Acts 21:29); it is possible both that Tychicus </p>
<p>was from Ephesus, and is in Jerusalem at the time of Paul’s arrest.</p>
<p>Paul’s closing sentence reiterates his central themes of love and peace, </p>
<p>while emphasizing God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. His blessing </p>
<p>of peace recalls his opening salutation of peace and grace to God’s holy </p>
<p>ones from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (1:2). e hearers </p>
<p>now know that peace has been gained in Christ, who is the believer’s </p>
<p>peace (2:14). is peace is based on the cross and resurrection of Christ, </p>
<p>and is experienced by believers who are raised and seated with Christ </p>
<p>(2:6). Paul emphasized the love of God made known in his redemption </p>
<p>plan (2:4–5), and of living out one’s calling in love (4:2). He commended </p>
<p>them for their faith in Christ and their love for the saints (1:15). is love </p>
<p>is centered in the redemptive work of Christ (5:2); it is a love that nds </p>
<p>expression in their faith in Christ (3:17; 4:15–16). is love is unceasing, </p>
<p>indestructible (see also 1 Cor 15:42, 50–54; Rom 8:37–39), for it is rooted </p>
<p>in Christ’s never-ending love. Grace covers those who love Christ with </p>
<p>this imperishable, constant love.</p>
