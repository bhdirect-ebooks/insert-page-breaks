<p>Introduction</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>letter was intended as an encyclical letter to be read by various churches </p>
<p>in the vicinity of Ephesus.</p>
<p>External Evidence for Authorship</p>
<p>e latter possibility is reinforced by a particular textual variant. In some </p>
<p>of the most reliable manuscripts, the words “in Ephesus” are not found in </p>
<p>1:1 as one would expect. Several questions immediately come to mind, </p>
<p>such as whether Paul would write a letter that would be read to various </p>
<p>churches. In Col 4:15–16, Paul requests that his letter to them be shared </p>
<p>with the nearby city of Laodicea, and the letter he sent to the latter city </p>
<p>(not extant) be read by the Colossians. Again, Galatians is also written </p>
<p>to the churches in that province. From these examples we could at least </p>
<p>conclude that Paul is not opposed to having several churches read each </p>
<p>other’s letters. Interestingly, an ancient writer, Marcion (declared a heretic </p>
<p>for his views on the Jewish Bible/Old Testament and the person of Jesus) </p>
<p>is reported by Tertullian to have identied Ephesians as Paul’s letter to the </p>
<p>Laodiceans, but it is unclear, however, whether Tertullian is speaking of </p>
<p>the letter itself or the superscription (title page, if you will), and whether </p>
<p>Marcion is supplying a missing text or changing an existing text.</p>

<p>Further questions include whether the manuscripts without “in </p>
<p>Ephesus” are accurate in their rendering, or whether there is some corrup-</p>
<p>tion whereby the relevant locale was omitted. e oldest sources, includ-</p>
<p>ing P</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>(third century CE), Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus (both</p>
<p>fourth century CE), omit “in Ephesus” in the actual letter, but do include </p>
<p>“to the Ephesians” in the superscription. ese three manuscripts are of </p>
<p>the Alexandrian text type, which suggests a local variant. e rest of the </p>
<p>reliable manuscripts, from a variety of regions, including the early Coptic </p>
<p>(Egyptian language) translation, incorporate the phrase “in Ephesus.” </p>
<p>is list includes the earliest editorial changes in both Sinaiticus and </p>
<p>Vaticanus. us we have excellent external evidence for both readings. </p>
<p>Finally, Origen, who lived both in Alexandria and in Caesarea Maritima, </p>
<p>in his commentary on Ephesians seems not to have used a manuscript </p>
<p>that had the words “in Ephesus.” However, he makes it clear in the text </p>
<p>that he believes Paul is writing to the Ephesians, as his opening line in </p>
<p>the discussion of Eph 1:1 reads “In the case of Ephesians alone we nd </p>
<p>12. Tertullian Marc. 5.11.12; 5.17.1.</p>
