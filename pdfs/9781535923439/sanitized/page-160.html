<p>Fusing the Horizons: Infanticide and Abortion</p>

<p>and thus shameful.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> While our society today does not countenance the expo-</p>
<p>sure of infants, many point to abortion, which has claimed untold numbers of </p>
<p>children, as a parallel. Many churches’ positions today against the dominant </p>
<p>rationales for abortion, which are similar to the defenses given for infanticide, </p>
<p>stand in line with its ancient witness to the inviolability of life.</p>
<p>The New Testament itself does not directly speak about abortion, per-</p>
<p>haps because this procedure was not practiced among Jews, and apparently </p>
<p>was infrequent among Gentiles because of the risks to the mother. Yet if we </p>
<p>look at the larger picture of the New Testament story, we hear a chord that </p>
<p>sounds against the practice.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>First, the New Testament indicates that life is</p>
<p>from God (John 1:3–5), and life is a gift. Second, humans are called to be </p>
<p>stewards of life. Third, Christ died for all human life, including that which </p>
<p>lives in utero. How did Jesus and the earliest community live out these reali-</p>
<p>ties? Jesus cites the Good Samaritan as an example of aiding those who are </p>
<p>helpless and needy. Paul calls on believers to imitate Christ, who himself gave </p>
<p>his life for needy humanity.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>The church today has the opportunity to extend</p>
<p>aid in several ways. First, it must embrace women who have had abortions </p>
<p>as loved by God; judgmental attitudes have no place in the church. Second, </p>
<p>it must care for mothers who are unable to care for their children. Third, it </p>
<p>should promote adoption. The church today might echo Mother Teresa’s plea </p>
<p>at the National Prayer Breakfast in 1994, “And for this I appeal in India and </p>
<p>I appeal everywhere: ‘Let us bring the child back.’”</p>

<p>rape) and medical issues (for example, imminent death of the mother) surrounding a </p>
