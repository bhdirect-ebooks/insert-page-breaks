<p>real and truthful view of the world along with the power to act justly in it </p>
<p>(see also Rom 13:11–14; 1 ess 5:4–11).</p>
<p>Accompanying the command to be lled with the Spirit are sev-</p>
<p>eral participles that describe what such lling might involve. All these </p>
<p>behaviors suppose a community context. A Spirit-lled life is character-</p>
<p>ized by such deep joy that songs, psalms, and melodies will spring forth. </p>
<p>ankfulness is the constant harmony that supports the daily praises. Paul </p>
<p>declares boldly that a Spirit-lled person gives thanks always, and for all </p>
<p>things. Since he has clearly acknowledged that the days are evil (5:16) </p>
<p>Paul is certainly aware that bad things happen. Are we to be thankful for </p>
<p>the bad things? No, but a thankful heart is a faithful one. We are to be </p>
<p>thankful in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, the one who has redeemed </p>
<p>us, the one with whom we are raised and seated (2:5–6). We know with </p>
<p>absolute assurance that all things are under Christ’s feet, and he is head </p>
<p>over all (1:22). ough the days are evil and darkness threatens, we walk </p>
<p>as ones who see wisely, who know the end of the story, and thus can be </p>
<p>thankful.</p>
<p>Household Codes (5:21–32)</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. </p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Wives, </p>
<p>submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. </p>
<p>23</p>
<p>For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head </p>
<p>of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. </p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Now as </p>
<p>the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to </p>
<p>their husbands in everything. </p>
<p>25</p>
<p>Husbands, love your wives, </p>
<p>just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her </p>
<p>26</p>
<p>to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water </p>
<p>through the word, </p>
<p>27</p>
<p>and to present her to himself as a radiant </p>
<p>church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but </p>
<p>holy and blameless. </p>
<p>28</p>
<p>In this same way, husbands ought to </p>
<p>love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife </p>
<p>loves himself. </p>
<p>29</p>
<p>Aer all, people have never hated their own </p>
<p>bodies, but they feed and care for them, just as Christ does </p>
<p>the church—</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>for we are members of his body. </p>
