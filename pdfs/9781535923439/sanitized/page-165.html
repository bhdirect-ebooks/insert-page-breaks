<p>Slaves and Masters Addressed</p>

<p>For God is in history.”</p>

<p>Here racism is rationalized as God’s plan, which</p>
<p>must be accommodated for the good of all by the institution of slavery.</p>
<p>Not until the civil rights movement did the country face head-on the </p>
<p>racism that was oating under the surface of the slavery debate. Today </p>
<p>racism is widely decried as unacceptable and antithetical to the Christian </p>
<p>gospel. Interestingly, and perhaps not coincidentally, the civil rights </p>
<p>movement raised questions of gender equality as well as racial equality. </p>
<p>e roots of both go back to the civil war arguments, where proslavery </p>
<p>proponents warned that freeing the black man would only lead to women </p>
<p>desiring the vote. e abolitionists oen rejected that charge, but there </p>
<p>was truth to it. Facing racism directly opened the way to address patri-</p>
<p>archy. A number of American Christians today struggle with questions </p>
<p>about the proper role of women in the church and home. e position of </p>
<p>male headship is oen connected to issues such as abortion or gay rights, </p>
<p>and the claim is made that a denial of the former implies acceptance of </p>
<p>the latter. Additionally, male headship is seen as the conservative alterna-</p>
<p>tive to liberal theology, which relegates the Bible to secondary status. e </p>
<p>similarities to the proslavery argument, which matched the abolitionist </p>
<p>position with a denial of biblical authority, are sobering. What is called </p>
<p>for is a careful discussion with all cards on the table, including the histori-</p>
cal context of the biblical writing, individual readers’ experiences, and a
<p>nuanced approach to the biblical text that recognizes the predisposition </p>
<p>each reader and every generation bring to the hermeneutical task.</p>
<p>Put On the Full Armor of God (6:10–20)</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your </p>
<p>stand against the devil’s schemes. </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>For our struggle is not </p>
<p>against esh and blood, but against the rulers, against the </p>
<p>authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against </p>
<p>the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>erefore </p>
<p>put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil </p>
<p>comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and aer you </p>
<p>have done everything, to stand. </p>
