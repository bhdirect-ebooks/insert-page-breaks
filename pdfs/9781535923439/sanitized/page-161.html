<p>it to subsequent generations to rid the country of such terror. From our </p>
<p>perspective today, it seems common sense that no person should own </p>
<p>another, so how did the early Americans justify the practice? A second </p>
<p>question follows, namely how did later pro-slavery and abolitionists read </p>
<p>their Bibles concerning slavery? ese questions will be examined aer </p>
<p>looking at Paul’s injunctions to slaves and owners.</p>
<p>In Paul’s day, slavery was not based on race or religion, but on fate, </p>
<p>chance, or birth. Defeated armies and peoples were enslaved, those cap-</p>
<p>tured by pirates were held as slaves, and many slaves were born to slave </p>
<p>mothers. Slaves might be better educated than a free man or woman, have </p>
<p>better living accommodations and might hope to gain their freedom, and </p>
<p>with it, Roman citizenship. ese slaves were household slaves living with </p>
<p>wealthy families, and might even own slaves themselves. Other slaves </p>
<p>rowed in galley ships, worked in mines or in elds, and died in the gladi-</p>
<p>atorial games. Yet all slaves shared this in common: they were owned by </p>
<p>another. eir low status extended to the marketplace and public venues, </p>
<p>where they were expected to honor all free and freed people. For many, </p>
<p>the slave was an animal with a voice that could be abused with impunity. </p>
<p>Owners had sexual access to both their male and female slaves, and their </p>
<p>behavior towards slaves was known to be rough and indecent. Many pros-</p>
<p>titutes (male and female) were slaves. Husbands were not to treat their </p>
wives as they did their slaves, as seen in a rst-century CE divorce ling
<p>wherein the wife defended the separation because her husband treated </p>
<p>her as he did his slave.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>In Paul’s injunction to slaves, several points should be noted. First, </p>
<p>Paul speaks directly to slaves, something not seen outside the New </p>
<p>Testament. Greco-Roman authors spoke to masters about treating slaves </p>
<p>kindly, but never addressed slaves directly. Second, Paul commands that </p>
<p>slaves obey their masters, but he does not stop with that injunction for he </p>
<p>would be telling them nothing they did not already know. Paul expounds </p>
<p>on what this obedience looks like. He asks that they assume a posture of </p>
<p>fear and trembling. A similar request was made to wives, that they fear </p>
<p>(respect) their husbands (5:33). In Phil 2:12, Paul asks that all believers </p>
<p>work out their salvation with fear and trembling, a posture suitable before </p>
<p>God. us in Paul’s time, fear or respect is that which is owed to the per-</p>
