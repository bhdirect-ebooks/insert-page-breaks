<p>Ephesians 6:10–20</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>connected to his body. Encased in God’s own armor (not armor given by </p>
<p>God), the church grows towards Christ by actively defeating evil, and thus </p>
<p>when fully grown, Christ will be head of the entire universe. Following </p>
<p>this interpretation, 6:13 is interpreted that having defeated or destroyed </p>
<p>everything, the church will stand. is position draws from the image of </p>
<p>the Divine Warrior in Isa 59:15–16.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>But is the church the “other” Christ?</p>
<p>As much as Paul extols the place of the church in God’s redemptive plan, </p>
<p>he does not speak of it as a second incarnation of the Logos. e presence </p>
<p>of the Spirit in its midst is not the same as the indwelling of the Logos in </p>
<p>Christ. While Christ is God’s Son, believers are adopted children who </p>
<p>are part of the family because of the Son’s work on the cross. Christ is the </p>
<p>rstfruits, and believers await the nal resurrection. So we can conclude </p>
<p>that the new person (4:24) will exist into eternity, but the armor of God is </p>
<p>necessary only so long as evil is attacking believers. In 4:24 Paul speaks of </p>
<p>an internal change that remakes a person (a new creation, see 2 Cor 5:17), </p>
<p>while in 6:11 the focus is on defensive equipment available to protect the </p>
<p>new person until the warfare is accomplished.</p>
<p>Paul draws his description of the full armor of God primarily from </p>
<p>Isaiah. In 11:4–5, Isaiah speaks of the Messiah’s righteousness girded </p>
<p>about his waist and the word of his mouth with which he will slay the </p>
<p>wicked. Isa 49:2 notes that God’s servant speaks—“he made my mouth </p>
<p>like a sharpened sword.” Isaiah 52:7 speaks of the feet of the one preach-</p>
<p>ing the good news of peace. And Isa 59:17 speaks of God himself putting </p>
<p>on righteousness as a breastplate and placing on his head a helmet of sal-</p>
<p>vation. When Paul describes the full armor of God that a Christian puts </p>
<p>on, he rst speaks of buckling on truth. is truth is the reality of God’s </p>
<p>work in Christ that condemns sin and death, and brings new life and </p>
<p>the Spirit. e breastplate of righteousness may refer to either the verdict </p>
<p>of acquittal pronounced to each believer, or the ethical righteousness in </p>
<p>which each believer should live. e feet of believers are tted not with </p>
<p>shoes but with the readiness of the good news (see also Rom 10:15). e </p>
<p>image here is either to be ready to proclaim the gospel, or ready to stand </p>
<p>rm for the gospel. e shield of faith protects against aming arrows. In </p>
<p>Paul’s time, the soldier’s shield was wrapped in leather and then soaked in </p>
<p>water, which prevented the enemy’s arrows from setting the shield ablaze. </p>
<p>e helmet of salvation is taken up (see also 1 ess 5:8) as believers stand </p>
