<p>Yo u and We in Paul’s Argument</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>with the deed. We will return to look more closely at the meanings of </p>
<p>these verbs below, but here I want to note that Paul includes himself and </p>
<p>all Jewish believers (“we”) together with the Gentile believers (“you”) in </p>
<p>these acts of God. But in the middle of this great claim, he switches to </p>
<p>using the second-person plural—“by grace you have been saved” (2:6). </p>
<p>Why not say “we have been saved”? I think the verb tense is important. </p>
<p>e verb is in the perfect tense, both here and in 2:8, which indicates that </p>
<p>a past action has continuing relevance at the present. Unlike the other </p>
<p>three verbs, which indicate a past action nished and done with, this verb </p>
<p>indicates a continuing activity. at is why some translate the verb as “you </p>
<p>are saved” rather than “you have been saved.” e verb carries both mean-</p>
<p>ings. An analogy might help. I am married; that is my current state, but </p>
<p>it implies a past starting point, my wedding. e eect of the wedding is </p>
<p>that I am currently and have been married. e power of my vows and my </p>
<p>husband’s vows remain in eect. So too God’s promises in Christ remain </p>
<p>eective against sin. us the present state owes itself to a past action by </p>
<p>God in Christ, but that past action is not the whole story. e action is an </p>
<p>ongoing one, you were saved and are saved—salvation has a beginning, </p>
<p>middle, and end.</p>
<p>Salvation for Paul is not a ticket into heaven for your soul, but the en-</p>
<p>trance into fellowship with God and his people. As such, Paul is assuring </p>
<p>the Gentiles that you are part of that salvation plan, you are now a citizen </p>
<p>of God’s kingdom, you are part of God’s new temple. In Paul’s day, Jews </p>
<p>who believed in Christ would have already appreciated that they were </p>
<p>part of God’s family, and they would have understood the community </p>
<p>aspect of God working through his people to reveal his love and mercy </p>
<p>to the world. But for Gentiles, this was a staggering, astounding concept. </p>
<p>erefore twice Paul states it, so the readers would be clear: you Gentiles </p>
<p>are saved by grace; all the promises, hopes, power, and responsibilities of </p>
<p>citizenship in God’s kingdom have been advanced to you in Christ.</p>
<p>One further pronoun shi should be noted, the shi from “you” in </p>
<p>2:1, referring to those “being dead in transgressions,” to “we” in 2:5, “be-</p>
<p>ing those dead in transgressions.” e same Greek participle and nouns </p>
<p>are used, only the pronoun varies. At rst glance it might appear that Paul </p>
<p>in these verses is generalizing all humanity into believer and non-believer </p>
<p>categories. However, in 2:1 those being dead in trespasses are further </p>
<p>explained as walking in the ways of this world and following the ways </p>
<p>of this present age. Jews have God’s revelation, so they can discern truth </p>
