<p>Paul’s account. e letter is a success; Philemon frees Onesimus, who re-</p>
<p>turns to Paul who is still imprisoned. Aer some unspecied time elapses, </p>
<p>Tychicus and Onesimus return to Colossae with their letter (and presum-</p>
<p>ably the one to the Laodiceans).</p>
<p>e above scenario depends upon Onesimus being a runaway slave, </p>
<p>but such a conclusion has rightly come under heavy scrutiny in recent </p>
<p>years. First, it assumes that runaway slaves were imprisoned, but why did </p>
<p>the person who captured Onesimus not return him to his owner, espe-</p>
<p>cially as oen rewards were given for returned slaves? Second, it is alleged </p>
<p>that Onesimus stole from Philemon, but Paul does not include any men-</p>
<p>tion of Onesimus’ repentance for running away or stealing goods. In fact, </p>
<p>Paul does not even mention that he had found Philemon’s runaway slave! </p>
<p>is suggests that Philemon knew Onesimus’ location and was aware of </p>
<p>his reason for being there.</p>
<p>Another theory suggests that Onesimus was not so much running </p>
<p>away as seeking out Paul to mediate a disagreement between himself and </p>
<p>Philemon. e argument draws on the gure of the amicus domini, or </p>
<p>friend of the master. An ancient example from the early second century </p>
<p>CE oen cited is Pliny the Younger’s letter to his friend Sabinianus.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>this exchange, Pliny speaks of Sabinianus’ freedman (a former slave) who </p>
<p>begs Sabinianus’ mercy and forgiveness by beseeching Pliny to speak on </p>
<p>his behalf. Pliny agrees, and writes to assure his friend Sabinianus that the </p>
<p>freedman is reformed, repentant of his past deeds, and ready to make a </p>
<p>clean start. None of these details are present, however, in Paul’s letter to </p>
<p>Philemon. Moreover, no mention is made of Onesimus repenting and </p>
<p>seeking mercy, or of Philemon being angry at his slave’s behavior (Pliny </p>
<p>notes Sabinianus’ outrage at his freedman’s behavior). Importantly, Pliny </p>
<p>is speaking about a freed slave, not one currently enslaved.</p>
<p>A second, and stronger, argument concerning Onesimus is that </p>
<p>he was sent to Paul by Philemon to help the former survive in prison. </p>
<p>Onesimus was functioning in a similar way to Epaphroditus, who was the </p>
<p>emissary for the Philippian church, bringing aid and cheer to the conned </p>
<p>apostle (Phil 2:25). Onesimus apparently became quite valuable to Paul’s </p>
<p>ongoing ministry, thus prompting Paul to ask that Philemon consider </p>
<p>releasing Onesimus to full-time service with Paul. is reconstruction </p>
<p>makes better sense of Paul’s letter to Philemon, and is more historically </p>
<p>43. Pliny the Younger Ep. 9.21.</p>
