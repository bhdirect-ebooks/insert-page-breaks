<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Overview of Paul’s Letter to the Ephesians</p>
<p>Perhaps no letter in the Pauline corpus takes the reader to such moun-</p>
<p>tain heights of adoration and to such level elds of practicality as the six </p>
<p>short chapters of Ephesians do. One might call it a feast for the Christian </p>
<p>imagination, for it lays out the gospel with great depth and intellectual </p>
<p>texture. Paul</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>reects on the magnicence, even lavishness, of God’s</p>
<p>redemptive work established in Christ and continued in the Spirit. </p>
<p>Chrysostom remarks how Paul grasped the eternal plan of God, connect-</p>
<p>ing Paul’s thought with Christ’s own words in Matt 25:34 to the faithful </p>
<p>that he will welcome them into the kingdom prepared for them from the </p>
<p>foundation of the world.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> Paul explores the intricacies of what this king-</p>
<p>dom looks like for the church now and in the future, as he lls out the </p>
<p>picture of the Triune God who from the beginning has orchestrated this </p>
<p>grand movement of salvation. Jerome, likely following Origen, acknowl-</p>
<p>edged the complexity of Paul’s thought in describing God’s free gi of </p>
<p>salvation. Recall, Jerome remarks, that Ephesus in Paul’s day had at its </p>
<p>center the great temple of Artemis/Diana and the widely practiced magi-</p>
<p>cal arts commanding allegiance and attention of all its dwellers and visi-</p>
<p>tors. Paul’s letter taught deep theological realities about the powers and </p>
<p>principalities against which believers do battle, for the Ephesians were </p>
<p>in the thick of the ght.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Martin Luther, in his theological disagreement</p>
<p>with the Roman Catholic Church, argued that Ephesians (4:5) expressed </p>
<p>Paul’s vision of the church as the one true body of believers united by one </p>
<p>heart even though separated physically by thousands of miles.</p>
