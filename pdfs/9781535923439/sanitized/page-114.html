<p>EphEsians 4</p>
<p>Paul’s detailed, robust theology and his personal witness to which the </p>
<p>reader has been treated in the last three chapters has been leading up to his </p>
<p>call in 4:1—to walk worthy of who you are in Christ. Carefully articulated </p>
<p>theology must at some point be applied, and it is to this job that Paul now </p>
<p>turns. e ethics enjoined upon believers is in keeping with the theologi-</p>
<p>cal claims of the earlier chapters, and so we are not surprised to read about </p>
<p>walking rightly and keeping unity and above all demonstrating love, for </p>
<p>these traits are characteristic of the Godhead whom believers serve. e </p>
<p>goal of good theology, then, is an upright life, moving to maturity, able </p>
<p>to discern spiritual matters and understand God’s wisdom. Paul asks the </p>
<p>Ephesians twice to walk in a particular manner (4:1, 17). ese calls serve </p>
<p>to organize the chapter into halves, the rst dealing with the one God </p>
<p>giving specic gis for the one body (church), and the second looking </p>
<p>at the new person renewed by the Spirit to be one with other members </p>
<p>of the body. In the chapter, Paul’s burden is to encourage believers in a </p>
<p>holy lifestyle based on key theological truths. First, the God who calls is </p>
<p>the one God; hence the believers ought also to live in unity. Second, the </p>
<p>Christ who calls has the full measure of grace for each believer, and from </p>
<p>that grace gives gis to spur on wisdom and growth.</p>
<p>One Body in Christ, Diverse Gifts (4:1–16)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life wor-</p>
<p>thy of the calling you have received. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Be completely humble </p>
<p>and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Make every eort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the </p>
<p>bond of peace. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>ere is one body and one Spirit, just as you </p>
<p>were called to one hope when you were called; </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>one Lord, one </p>
<p>faith, one baptism; </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>one God and Father of all, who is over all </p>
