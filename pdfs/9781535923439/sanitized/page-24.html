<p>the phrase ‘to the saints who are.’”</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>He has a remarkable interpretation</p>
<p>of the awkward Greek, namely that Paul is describing the Ephesians as </p>
<p>those who once were not, but now are, through God. He takes his cue </p>
<p>from Moses’ encounter with God in the desert, when God reveals who he </p>
<p>is by saying “I AM.” In both cases, the verb for “to be” is used. Although </p>
<p>we have only fragments of Origen’s commentary on Ephesians preserved, </p>
<p>Jerome clearly used it in composing his own commentary.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> And he prob-</p>
<p>ably also used Origen’s prologue as well, wherein Origen makes clear that </p>
<p>the letter in question is addressed to the Ephesian church, suering from </p>
<p>an overwhelming attraction to magic and the goddess Diana (drawing on </p>
<p>Acts 19:1–20).</p>
<p>If the manuscript evidence is inconclusive, the internal evidence </p>
<p>might shi the balance. Usually textual critics prefer the more dicult </p>
<p>reading and the shorter reading. If these rules are followed, the omission </p>
<p>of the phrase in the original seems assured. In this case, the copyists, </p>
<p>aware of the dicult reading, stayed true to the text in front of them, not </p>
<p>smoothing out the reading. ey would have no apparent reason for omit-</p>
<p>ting the city’s name. In fact, they might have assumed Paul was following </p>
<p>the Hellenistic custom whereby a royal decree was oen lacking a specic </p>
<p>addressee because the declaration was to be read in numerous cities.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>However, a further critical rule suggests that if a variant reading is </p>
<p>nonsensical or uncharacteristic of the author’s work, the longer reading </p>
<p>should be supported. In this case, the omission creates an odd reading in </p>
<p>Greek and is uncharacteristic of Pauline letters. Normally we nd Paul </p>
<p>using “to those who are” followed by a place name in his introduction </p>
<p>and greetings. ose manuscripts that omit the place name read awk-</p>
<p>wardly, “to the saints, to those who are, and believers in Christ Jesus.” </p>
<p>e problematic reading might be better explained as a copyist error than </p>
<p>coming from the original text. Some suggest, however, that the omission </p>
<p>indicates this letter was intended as an encyclical epistle to be read in </p>
<p>several churches. It was up to Paul’s envoy and letter carrier, Tychicus, to </p>
<p>insert the city’s name as he read it to the several churches in small cities </p>
<p>in the vicinity of Ephesus. Although no copy of the letter has either a </p>
<p>space in the manuscript for a city’s name to be inserted or the preposition </p>
