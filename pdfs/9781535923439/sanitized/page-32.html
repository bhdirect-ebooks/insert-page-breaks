<p>his point made to the Corinthians. In both cases, it is Christ who estab-</p>
<p>lishes the shape of the building and gives it security and strength.</p>
<p>Historical Context of Ephesians</p>
<p>A third area of concern for those who postulate Ephesians as pseudo-</p>
<p>apostolic is the historical context of the letter, or more accurately, the </p>
<p>apparent lack of historical context. In other letters, Paul is responding </p>
<p>to intruders in the congregation (Galatians, 2 Corinthians), a letter sent </p>
<p>by the community (1 Corinthians), a false teaching (Colossians), or even </p>
<p>a gi sent by the community (Philippians). With Ephesians, nothing of </p>
<p>the sort immediately presents itself. Additionally, alleged glimpses of </p>
<p>the church suggest to some a congregation of a generation or more aer </p>
<p>Paul. Specically, the church is described as fully integrated, with Jew and </p>
<p>Gentile now one in the peace of Christ (2:14–18). Such a scene is mark-</p>
<p>edly dierent from the tensions between Jew and Gentile that seem to </p>
<p>permeate the Galatian churches or the Roman community. While these </p>
<p>points have some merit, not all churches struggled with such tensions; for </p>
<p>example, 1 and 2 essalonians as well as 1 and 2 Corinthians rarely men-</p>
<p>tion the law or Jews or Judaism. It may be because the communities were </p>
<p>mainly Gentile, but if Acts can be used to shed light here, we might sug-</p>
<p>gest that some allied with the synagogue (Jews and God-fearers) began </p>
<p>to associate with followers of Christ. Moreover, history does not support </p>
<p>the assumption that a generation or two aer Paul the church had sorted </p>
<p>out the Jew/Gentile situation. us pushing the epistle into the second </p>
<p>century does not help the problem. A close reading of Eph 2:11–21 sug-</p>
<p>gests Paul is not describing the current state on the ground, as it were, </p>
<p>in his congregation. Instead, he is declaring what the cross and resur-</p>
<p>rection have done to bring Gentiles, those formerly alienated from the </p>
<p>true God, into fellowship with God’s people (2:19). Indeed, it is precisely </p>
<p>this truth that presents the historical setting for the epistle, namely the </p>
<p>urgency for living out this unity within the congregations. And, we might </p>
<p>add, interpreters have struggled to discern Paul’s overarching reason for </p>
<p>writing Romans (beyond his personal introduction and request for aid </p>
<p>in his planned visit to Spain), but have accepted the letter as genuinely </p>
<p>Pauline. Furthermore, the description of Paul in 3:1–11 raises problems </p>
<p>for some. ey note that the description of Paul as less than the least of </p>
<p>the saints (3:8) is too harsh. Yet Paul describes himself elsewhere as one </p>
