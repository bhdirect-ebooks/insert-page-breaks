<p>Ephesians 3:16–19</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>the church as the body of Christ is daily growing towards God’s fullness. </p>
<p>e implications of this translation include a more robust appreciation </p>
<p>for the presence of God in the congregation’s midst. e point is not that </p>
<p>believers become little gods but that the church as Christ’s body has the </p>
<p>capability to witness to the powers that exalt sin and its attending death. </p>
<p>For the church to carry out its tasks in the world and make known God’s </p>
<p>wisdom to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies or heavenly realms </p>
<p>(3:9–10), a lling of God is essential. Again, God’s fullness is not expe-</p>
<p>rienced as when we feel satiated aer a big meal, for that sort of fullness </p>
<p>makes us lethargic. Instead this is the fullness of the gas tank before the </p>
<p>long drive. To continue the analogy, the journey involves the church be-</p>
<p>ing Christ to the world, and the destination is the new heavens and new </p>
<p>earth, the great feast that awaits the redeemed.</p>
<p>Doxology (3:20–21)</p>
<p>e doxology is a tting end to the section on theology and a poignant </p>
<p>beginning to the discussion on ethics. Our neat categories, however, </p>
<p>might not have been embraced by Paul. Could it be that he saw chs. 4–6 </p>
<p>as outlining ways to worship? at the strength empowering the church </p>
<p>in their daily activities was a form of worship? Perhaps specic words </p>
<p>of praise are not the only means of worship, but worship might include </p>
<p>each act consecrated by the indwelling Christ and the Spirit’s power. Paul </p>
<p>sets the tone for obedience—it comes from the church’s new vision of </p>
<p>reality—the unsurpassed love and wisdom of God the Trinity. From this </p>
<p>place of awe and with the power given through the Spirit, the obedient </p>
<p>walk of faith can be a joyful journey of worship.</p>
<p>e doxology highlights themes found throughout Ephesians, in-</p>
<p>cluding God’s power in creation, in the church, and in Christ. In 3:20 Paul </p>
<p>twice uses terms rooted in “power” emphasizing God’s capability to do </p>
<p>what Paul has requested. Indeed, Paul recognizes that his requests merely </p>
<p>scratch the surface of God’s power to realize his wisdom and will over his </p>
<p>creation. is power works in us, the church. e plural used here reects </p>
<p>Paul’s conviction that God chooses to work through his people. God’s </p>
<p>glory is to be known and praised in the church and in Christ. God’s glory </p>
<p>is reected in Christ, as the fullness of God dwells in Christ (Col 1:19). </p>
<p>And since the church is Christ’s body (1:22–23), it too reects God’s glory, </p>
<p>in a secondary way. Paul’s prayer and doxology share similar themes with </p>
