<p>Paul’s Imprisonment</p>
<p>Proceeding under the conviction that Paul wrote Ephesians, we turn our </p>
<p>attention to the signicance of Paul’s imprisonment as the backdrop to </p>
<p>this letter. Two locations are generally given as the setting for the writing: </p>
<p>Ephesus and Rome (with a small minority suggesting Caesarea Maritima). </p>
<p>Acts notes Paul’s imprisonment in Rome (and Caesarea Maritima) and </p>
<p>Paul makes a comment about facing beasts in Ephesus, which some sug-</p>
<p>gest is an oblique reference to an imprisonment there (1 Cor 15:32). e </p>
<p>resolution of this problem is controlled in part by conclusions reached </p>
<p>concerning Pauline authorship of Philemon and Colossians, and to a </p>
<p>lesser extent, Philippians. Put simply, the problem involves four epistles </p>
<p>(known as the prison epistles), three interconnected lists of names, two </p>
<p>very similar epistles (Ephesians and Colossians), and one author, Paul. It </p>
<p>seems that Paul was in the same location when he composed Philemon </p>
<p>and Colossians, because Timothy coauthored the letters and so many </p>
<p>of the same people are referenced in both letters, including the slave </p>
<p>Onesimus. Additionally, it seems that Paul was in the same location when </p>
<p>he wrote Ephesians and Colossians, because both were to be delivered </p>
<p>by the same person, Tychicus. at suggests a scenario that allows for a </p>
<p>single imprisonment for at least three of the four prison epistles.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>Onesimus’ Status</p>
<p>A key element in the debate is the role played by Onesimus, Philemon’s </p>
<p>slave. e general consensus has been that Onesimus was a runaway </p>
<p>slave who happened upon Paul while both were imprisoned, and there he </p>
<p>came to faith in Christ through Paul’s ministry. Following this fortuitous </p>
<p>outcome, Paul seeks Onesimus’ release from Philemon, his owner and </p>
<p>Paul’s friend. Decisions about where Paul is imprisoned when he writes </p>
<p>to Philemon are thus predicated on where one imagines a runaway slave </p>
<p>might ee, or more specically, how far might he travel from Colossae. </p>
<p>e events are reconstructed as follows: Onesimus is imprisoned with Paul </p>
<p>and becomes a follower of Christ. Paul is duty bound to send Onesimus </p>
<p>back to Philemon, but he urgently desires that Philemon free his slave. </p>
<p>He urges Philemon to settle the outstanding debts owed by Onesimus to </p>
<p>42. Second Timothy also claims to be written from prison, but it is grouped with 1 </p>
<p>Tim and Titus in the Pastoral Epistles.</p>
