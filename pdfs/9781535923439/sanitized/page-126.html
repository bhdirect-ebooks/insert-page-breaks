<p>Fusing the Horizons: Ministry and the Church</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>useful analogy of player-coach to describe Paul’s point.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>The player-coach is</p>
<p>also part of the team which takes the playing ﬁeld; he or she is a single ele-</p>
<p>ment of the team’s success (or failure). Paul is not concerned here to speak </p>
about individual gifts (charismata) but about the outcome of those gifts on
<p>the saints. He is interested in describing what a body that has been “apostle-</p>
<p>ized,” “prophet-ized,” “evangelized,” “pastor-ized,” and “teacher-ized” looks </p>
<p>like. The focus is not on those using particular gifts, but the effect of those </p>
<p>gifts on the body. This could be a refreshing way to look at our own church </p>
<p>structures, which tend to isolate ministry in the hands of paid staff. And it ﬁts </p>
<p>tightly with the picture of the church drawn thus far in Ephesians: a church </p>
<p>uniﬁed through Christ, sealed with the Spirit, witnessing to the world God’s </p>
<p>redemption by showing peace to all for all are God’s children, and balancing </p>
<p>that with a strong grip on truth, letting God’s light shine forth unapologetically </p>
<p>in love.</p>
<p>e saints are equipped not only for the work of ministry but to </p>
<p>build up the body (4:12, 16). is theme is not new to the letter, for we </p>
<p>see it stressed in 2:20–21, which focuses on the church comprised of both </p>
<p>Jews and Gentiles being built upon the foundation of the apostles and </p>
<p>prophets. Additionally, both 4:16 and 2:21 speak of the body being t-</p>
<p>ted together, thereby reinforcing Paul’s central theme of unity. Within the </p>
<p>entire letter, such oneness is primarily understood as the union in Christ </p>
<p>of Jew and Gentile. Although in this section Paul does not explicitly men-</p>
<p>tion Jew and Gentile, it is likely in his mind, for he references Gentiles in </p>
<p>2:17 when he contrasts the Ephesians’ old way of life as Gentiles with their </p>
<p>new life in Christ.</p>
<p>One nal point must be made concerning 4:12. Paul states that the </p>
<p>saints are equipped for the work of ministry, the up-building of the body </p>
<p>of Christ. In 2:10, Paul declares that God has prepared in advance good </p>
<p>works for believers. Are these good works the same as the work of minis-</p>
<p>try? If so, then the picture of the good works is a corporate one wherein </p>
<p>each member of the church participates in the overall good work of the </p>
<p>church in building up the body of Christ in unity and fullness of knowl-</p>
edge. is perspective is a helpful corrective to our Western individual-ism, which tends to see 2:10 as speaking about individual acts of piety.
