<p>Paul’s Request for Prayer and Boldness</p>
<p>159</p>
<p>boldly the mystery entrusted to him. A special measure of boldness is </p>
<p>necessary in his current circumstances, as Paul sits in chains. His present </p>
<p>situation stems from his courage in preaching the gospel message. Paul </p>
<p>is specic that the mystery of the gospel, namely the truth that God has </p>
<p>made Jew and Gentile one in Christ, is what has landed him in chains. </p>
<p>And yet he speaks of himself as an ambassador (see also 2 Cor 5:20), </p>
<p>someone who is protected from imprisonment by social protocol. is </p>
<p>ironic position highlights the truth of his message. e immediate danger </p>
<p>as Paul sees it is failing to nish strong in his testimony before Caesar. He </p>
<p>asks the Ephesians to pray that he might boldly present the mystery of </p>
<p>God’s new creation, the oneness of all people in Christ. As he faces a esh </p>
<p>and blood enemy called Caesar, Paul is mindful that his spiritual enemies </p>
<p>will do all they can to destroy his testimony and lead him to apostasy.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Christian Nominalism and Life in the Spirit</p>
<p>Why is it so hard for believers to follow a moral path? Why so often do we </p>
<p>fall into nominalism? In the United States, our consumer mentality slides </p>
<p>unwelcomed into church; we are practical and admire productivity and ef-</p>
<p>ﬁciency. We hold religion to be a private conviction, but Christianity claims </p>
<p>to speak about absolute truth, the one true God. We think that God’s main </p>
<p>role is to take care of us, and we remain content as infants in Christ (1 Cor </p>
<p>3:1–3). We suggest accountability groups, house churches, tests to discern </p>
<p>spiritual gifts, or new theologies to spur on congregations to holy living. These </p>
<p>solutions carry many beneﬁts, but our cultural inclination to ﬁx problems by </p>
<p>ourselves surfaces in our approach to nominal Christianity. Paul’s answer is to </p>
<p>look up, not out. Paul points to God, not to the range of human solutions. Two </p>
<p>points must be emphasized. First, Paul begins and ends with God because the </p>
<p>danger is not from humans (blood and ﬂesh), but from spiritual forces. While </p>
<p>today we do not always understand the present age as saturated with evil, Paul </p>
<p>understood the depths of sin, wickedness, and deception that characterize </p>
<p>this age. Second, Paul proclaims that God’s grace is not a given, it is a gift. In </p>
<p>our conﬁdence (rightly placed) that God has done everything necessary for our </p>
<p>salvation, we slide into the assumption that he will never discipline, direct, or </p>
<p>demand obedience. But as his body we are growing and as his temple, we are </p>
<p>under construction. Change is part of the equation.</p>
