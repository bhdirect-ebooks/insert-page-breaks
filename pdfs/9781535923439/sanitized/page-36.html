<p>al data or alleged historical details that might motivate the reader to copy </p>
<p>the philosopher’s behavior. Since the reader knew the important gure of </p>
<p>the distant past was not in fact the author, presenting the personal details </p>
<p>as though the philosopher himself wrote it was not deceptive, but rather </p>
<p>a literary convention that served to promote the well-known ideals of the </p>
<p>philosophy. Because genuine letters can exhibit similar characteristics, </p>
<p>such as encouraging imitation and stressing ethics, recognizing pseude-</p>
<p>pigraphic epistles is not, therefore, always simple and straightforward.</p>
<p>Pausing for a moment, it seems useful to ask whether the characteris-</p>
<p>tics noted above are helpful in deciding whether there are pseudepigraph-</p>
<p>ic letters in the New Testament. A review of the various Greco-Roman </p>
<p>corpuses reveals few similarities with the Pauline corpus. Many in the </p>
<p>former category do not have the sender’s name in each letter; rather, the </p>
<p>real reader knows who the sender is because the letter is embedded in </p>
<p>the larger corpus of epistles attributed to that gure. Second, oen the </p>
<p>material is of a very general nature, amounting to a philosophical reec-</p>
<p>tion. ird, the letters are usually much shorter than the ones in the New </p>
<p>Testament, though a few are the length of Paul’s shorter letters. Finally, the </p>
<p>attributed author is a gure from the distant, classical Greek period. An </p>
<p>exception is the second-century CE collection of Apollonius of Tyana’s </p>
<p>letters, which, as single-line statements or quips, are hardly comparable to </p>
<p>the epistles of the New Testament.</p>
<p>Authority and Ownership of Literary “Property”</p>
<p>Digging deeper into the issue of ancient pseudepigraphy requires an ex-</p>
<p>amination into the sense of intellectual property held at the time, and the </p>
<p>role of the apostle and apostolic authority within the early church. While </p>
<p>no copyright law existed in the ancient world (that would not happen until </p>
<p>the advent of the printing press), there were guidelines and standards of </p>
<p>behavior. Readers held a much more laissez-faire attitude towards ctitious </p>
<p>letters by Plato, and reacted strongly against letters reportedly by Cicero </p>
<p>but written by another. e rule of thumb was that if the alleged author is </p>
<p>long deceased, and his ideas and thoughts had been widely disseminated </p>
<p>and absorbed, then producing letters to help an audience understand the </p>
<p>great man’s personal life and ideas was considered acceptable. As noted </p>
<p>above, letter collections of Plato, Diogenes and other Cynic philosophers, </p>
<p>or Pythagoras (sixth-century BCE philosopher and mathematician) and </p>
