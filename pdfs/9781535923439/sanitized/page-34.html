<p>were penned by him or his scribe. But with the rise of the modern criticism </p>
<p>of the Bible, and a renewed interest in ancient literary practices, various </p>
<p>scholars today assert that pseudonymity was an accepted and common </p>
<p>literary convention in the ancient world. Some even assert that only four </p>
<p>of Paul’s epistles can be certied as genuine: Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, </p>
<p>and Galatians. To evaluate these conclusions, several points should be tak-</p>
<p>en up, including the nature of the claims about ancient pseudepigraphic </p>
<p>letters, expectations of intellectual property, and the way the early church </p>
<p>addressed pseudepigraphy and pseudonymity. We should note at the start </p>
<p>that pseudepigraphic letters were popular in the Greco-Roman world, and </p>
<p>Jews of this time also produced and read pseudepigraphic works. Both of </p>
<p>these claims, however, require careful nuance if they are to inform the </p>
<p>discussion over the authorship of Ephesians. When we think about the </p>
<p>range of letters today, we imagine ocial letters sent between diplomats </p>
<p>wherein every word is carefully parsed, as well as grade school children </p>
<p>writing home from summer camp to parents or grandparents eager for </p>
<p>some news (and perhaps in this latter case the contents would be likewise </p>
<p>carefully edited!). In the ancient world, letters likewise served to unite </p>
<p>friends, accomplish tasks, keep in touch with family, or simply entertain. </p>
<p>In the latter category we nd collections of letters presented as written by </p>
<p>the ancient philosophers such as Plato (philosopher of the fourth century </p>
<p>BCE who studied under Socrates) or Diogenes (Cynic philosopher of </p>
<p>fourth-century BCE Athens). While no one doubts that the capabilities </p>
<p>of those two men certainly extended to writing letters, the collections of </p>
<p>their letters, produced in the Hellenistic period, were understood for the </p>
<p>most part to be pseudepigraphic, that is, written by someone other than </p>
<p>the claimed author. ese collections served to entertain and edify, they </p>
<p>oered another window into the imagined life of the great men (and a few </p>
<p>women in their circles). Today they also are cited by some as an analogue </p>
<p>to the deutero-Pauline material, so it is important that we explore the </p>
<p>world of pseudonymity on the ancient landscape.</p>
<p>e denition of pseudonymity in modern scholarship varies </p>
<p>widely, at times being conated with the category of “anonymous.” A </p>
<p>genuine letter is one written (directly or indirectly through a scribe) or </p>
<p>commissioned by the author named in the text. An anonymous letter </p>
<p>does not contain within the text an attribution to authorship; however, </p>
<p>such a text might later have an author falsely attributed to it. For our pur-</p>
<p>poses, a pseudepigraphic letter is one written by a person other than the </p>
