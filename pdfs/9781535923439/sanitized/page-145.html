<p>Social Stratiﬁcation</p>
The honor/shame culture relied on deﬁned roles so that individuals knew to
<p>whom they owed honor. Social categorization was critical, with status and rank </p>
<p>emphasized.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>This interest in social taxonomy reﬂected the wider search for</p>
<p>understanding the natural world. The modern saying “everything has a place, </p>
<p>and there is a place for everything” would have resonated well in the Greco-</p>
<p>Roman world. The ancient Greeks, and later the Hellenists and the Romans, </p>
<p>were fascinated with their physical environment, and sought to categorize and </p>
<p>catalogue the physical world into groups and sub-groups. Aristotle believed </p>
<p>that nature had created an order, and humans were to live out that ordering for </p>
<p>the sake of the home and the city (the political unit in Aristotle’s day was the </p>
<p>city-state). He concluded that male was the pinnacle of the created order, with </p>
<p>female inferior in all ways (both physical and intellectual), and slaves likewise </p>
<p>not ﬁt to make decisions but to follow orders. The Hellenistic world followed </p>
<p>Aristotle’s lead.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> They sought to understand the Mind of the universe repre-</p>
<p>sented in the logical order that sustained life. Chaos was greatly feared, and </p>
<p>every attempt to keep order was pursued. Hierarchy existed at all levels, as </p>
<p>philosophers and scientists created taxonomies of species, classiﬁcations of </p>
<p>heavenly bodies, and analyses of social and natural events.</p>
<p>Within this carefully constructed system, however, we ﬁnd some move-</p>
<p>ment. For example, a good soldier might rise in the ranks, as did the eques-</p>
<p>trian Vespasian whose military feats gained him senatorial ranking, and then </p>
<p>the ofﬁce of emperor (he ruled from 69–79 CE). Sadly, the fates might tip </p>
<p>against one, as they did the auxiliary soldier Spartacus from Thrace (Greece). </p>
<p>He apparently deserted, was captured by Rome, and subjected to slavery by </p>
<p>the very group he had earlier fought to protect. We know him best today as the </p>
<p>gladiator who led a large uprising against Rome. His hope of escaping Italy </p>
<p>and returning home failed, and he and his fellow slaves were slaughtered. But </p>
<p>the story of their revolt made slave masters’ blood run cold, and the fear of </p>
<p>being killed by one’s own slaves continued to haunt masters down to Paul’s </p>
<p>day.</p>
