to the dividing wall which was destroyed “in his esh.” But that syntax is
<p>awkward. Additionally, some argue that to say Christ’s work in the esh </p>
<p>destroyed enmity between Jew and Gentile is too narrow an interpreta-</p>
<p>tion of Christ’s death. However, as I noted above, Paul understands rec-</p>
<p>onciliation with God and new creation as two sides of the same coin, both </p>
<p>gained through Christ’s death and resurrection. Nonetheless, it makes </p>
<p>most sense to include “in his esh” with the abrogation of the law, the </p>
<p>third participle in the grouping. In sum, we suggest that both “hostility” </p>
<p>and “in his esh” are connected with the annulment of the law. Paul is </p>
<p>thus arguing that the hostility between Jews and Gentiles that is gener-</p>
<p>ated by the law (more on this below) is annulled or made inoperative in </p>
<p>Christ’s esh, probably referring to his death on the cross (2:13).</p>
<p>Why does Paul qualify the noun “law” with the phrase “with its com-</p>
mands and regulations”? It is historically anachronistic to divide the law
<p>into moral and ceremonial categories; Paul would not have been think-</p>
ing in such terms. However, if the dividing wall points metaphorically to
<p>the temple barrier, then the law of commandments in ordinances might </p>
<p>also speak to those decrees in particular that limit Jew/Gentile interac-</p>
<p>tion, namely circumcision (mentioned in 2:11) and food laws (see Gal </p>
<p>2:12–13) and even Sabbath (as in Rom 14:5–6). ese rites which create </p>
<p>barriers between Jew and Gentile do not qualify as the covenants of the </p>
<p>promise (2:12). Again, Paul claims to the Galatians that if the Gentile men </p>
<p>among them get circumcised, then they are obliged the keep the entire </p>
<p>law (Gal 5:3). Less likely is the possibility that the term “regulations” does </p>
<p>not go with commandments, but is contrasted to them. us Paul would </p>
<p>be arguing that in Christ’s ordinances, the law of the commandments has </p>
<p>been annulled, similar to his argument in 2 Cor 3:7–18, which contrasts </p>
<p>the written code and the ministry of the Spirit.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>In any case, what is clear is that the law no longer has the power </p>
to divide. Moreover, Christ’s purpose is to make something new from
<p>what were once two. is new thing is his body, the church, which now </p>
<p>has access in Christ to God the Father through the Spirit. e cross is </p>
<p>not only the place where believers’ sins are forgiven, but also the place </p>
<p>where something new is created. e new creation is not simply a new </p>
individual, but a new entity—Christ’s body, the church. As noted above,
<p>this new entity can be described as God’s household and God’s temple </p>
