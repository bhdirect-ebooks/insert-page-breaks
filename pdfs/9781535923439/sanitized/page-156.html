<p>2:24), connects to the eschatological vision of Christ and the church as </p>
<p>inextricably united. e mystery of God’s will (1:9), that Gentiles are co-</p>
<p>heirs with Jews in Christ, one body (3:3–9), has a further dimension. e </p>
<p>marriage of two becoming one develops into a sign of the unity of Christ </p>
<p>and the church, eective now and to be fully consummated in the end.</p>
<p>As exemplied in the institution of slavery discussed in the follow-</p>
<p>ing chapter, the way the ancient world ordered its society need not be </p>
<p>implemented today. I suggest that the institution of patriarchy, which </p>
<p>infused the social ordering of men and women, is destabilized by this </p>
<p>passage. Moreover, Paul’s goal is not only to shed light on marriage, but </p>
<p>to emphasize the supernatural mystery of which marriage serves as an </p>
<p>analogy. Paul probes the depths of the relationship between Christ and </p>
<p>the church, the unity shared by the body of believers, joined inseparably </p>
<p>together and to the head, Christ. e organic, visual impact of this image </p>
<p>should give each believer a rock solid condence in their own security in </p>
<p>Christ, as well as appreciation for the far-reaching importance of embrac-</p>
<p>ing the life of community with other believers as the church.</p>
