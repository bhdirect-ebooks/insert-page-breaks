<p>parts of the province.”</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>is follows the Roman assumption concerning</p>
<p>the polis or city, which understood its inuence to cover extensively the </p>
<p>surrounding territory outside its walls. For example, even before Paul’s </p>
<p>time, most of Italy was seen as part of Rome, broadly speaking. Freeborn </p>
<p>Italians had a form of Roman citizenship known as Latin rights citizen-</p>
<p>ship. A similar attitude towards large urban centers outside of Rome </p>
<p>continued in the imperial period.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>is allows for the possibility that</p>
<p>someone living even twenty miles (a day’s journey) from the Ephesus </p>
<p>city center might be considered (and consider themselves) an Ephesian. </p>
<p>Clearly the limit did not extend to Colossae, one hundred miles from </p>
<p>Ephesus, or Smyrna, thirty-ve miles away.</p>
<p>Internal Evidence</p>
<p>Literary Character of Ephesians</p>
<p>e main internal concerns that surface in any conversation about Pauline </p>
<p>authorship of Ephesians focus on the literary character, the theological </p>
<p>emphases, and the historical setting implied in the letter. Turning to the </p>
<p>rst point, we can be more specic in highlighting the singular turns of </p>
<p>phrase that some point to as indicative of a deutero-Pauline hand. For ex-</p>
<p>ample, instead of the usual term “Satan” in Ephesians, Paul speaks of the </p>
<p>“devil” (4:27, 6:11). Again, rather than his usual wording “the heavens,” he </p>
<p>speaks of “the heavenlies.” ese terms hardly indicate theological shis, </p>
<p>but because they are so insignicant they are thought to expose the au-</p>
<p>thor’s automatic reex. Since Paul would think automatically of the evil </p>
<p>one as “Satan,” the author of Ephesians, in using “devil,” exposes himself </p>
<p>as other than Paul. However, if we apply this logic to his other letters, we </p>
<p>see that it is awed. Paul can use synonyms for an idea or action, even </p>
<p>within the same letter. He is not limited to a single term to express his </p>
<p>ideas.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Again, the lengthy sentences and numerous participial phrases</p>
<p>are pointed to as reasons to doubt that Paul composed the letter. For </p>
<p>example, his opening thanksgiving runs from 1:3–14 (see also 1:15–23; </p>
<p>2:1–7; 3:2–13, 14–19; 4:1–6, 11–16; 6:14–20). But we nd long sentences </p>
<p>in other letters, especially when Paul writes doxologically (Rom 1:1–7, </p>

<p>18. Lightstone 2005: 214–25.</p>
