<p>pendent incarnation of Christ, because the church is only a functioning </p>
<p>body with Christ as its head.</p>
<p>ose who dene the powers and rulers as primarily human institu-</p>
<p>tions and political structures tend to see the armor of God as equipping </p>
<p>the church for oensive warfare. For example, Paul’s opening imperative </p>
<p>“be strong” is understood to be in the middle voice, meaning that believers </p>
<p>themselves are to be strong. ey note that Paul uses the image of wrestling </p>
<p>when speaking about the believers’ struggle with the enemy. is suggests </p>
<p>hand-to-hand combat. e verb “to withstand” or “stand your ground” is </p>
<p>understood as active resistance against evil. Again, pointing to the sword </p>
<p>of the Spirit, they emphasize that a sword can be used oensively against </p>
<p>the enemy. is interpretation, however, is weakened by several factors, </p>
<p>including Paul’s thrice repeated call to stand fast or rm. e image is not </p>
<p>of two ghters in a sword duel, but of one warrior capable of defending </p>
<p>himself against an opponent’s onslaught. e oensive weapon, the sword </p>
<p>of the Spirit, is dened by Paul as the word of God, which enables believ-</p>
<p>ers to pray all prayers and supplications for the Lord’s people, including </p>
Paul himself. Additionally, the de-emphasis on the individual believer is
<p>not consistent with Paul’s stress on each believer needing to grow and be </p>
<p>lled with the Spirit. Again, the opening imperative is better understood, </p>
<p>not in the middle voice, but in the passive voice—“being strengthened” </p>
<p>(see also 3:16). Believers don’t empower themselves, but through Christ </p>
<p>they have access to the mighty strength that raised him from the dead and </p>
<p>seated him above all powers.</p>
<p>ose who dene the principalities as human institutions with a </p>
<p>spiritual inner aspect see Paul’s call to put on armor as directed to the </p>
entire church corporately; less emphasis is placed on the individual tak-
<p>ing up the armor. is position has merit given Paul’s other arguments, </p>
<p>and his concern for the church as Christ’s body. However, we should not </p>
<p>establish an either/or scenario—Paul is concerned equally with the be-</p>
<p>liever being lled with the Spirit and the church growing up into its head, </p>
<p>Christ. We should not swing to the opposite side and interpret this text </p>
individualistically, as though Paul imagines independent warriors each
<p>on their own battling the powers and rulers. Paul calls all believers to be </p>
<p>praying for each other and keeping watch for each other. ose wearing </p>
<p>armor are still members of one body. Not just to the Ephesians, but also to </p>
<p>the Romans and the essalonians, Paul enjoins believers to put on God’s </p>
<p>armor (Rom 13:12; 1 ess 5:8).</p>
