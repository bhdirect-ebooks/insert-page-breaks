<p>EphEsians 1</p>
<p>e opening chapter of Ephesians is richly laced with superlatives, rhe-</p>
<p>torical ourishes, and repetition of ideas that all serve to magnify God the </p>
<p>Trinity. Aer identifying himself and the letter’s recipients, Paul launches </p>
<p>into a ten-verse eulogy praising God the Father and his work of salvation </p>
<p>through the Messiah and the fullled promises through the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p>Hard on the heels of the eulogy is Paul’s thanksgiving, reecting a natural </p>
<p>response of prayer that believers might most fully understand and know </p>
<p>the God spoken of in the blessing. e eulogy begins with the note that </p>
<p>God has blessed us with every spiritual blessing, and the thanksgiving </p>
<p>ends with acknowledging that Christ’s body, the church, is lled with the </p>
<p>fullness of the one (Christ) who lls all things. Paul employs a similar </p>
<p>strategy in 2 Corinthians, which begins with a eulogy, opening with the </p>
<p>same line, praising the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Perhaps </p>
<p>it is no coincidence that Paul begins 2 Corinthians with praise, for he </p>
<p>recounts that he faced terrible circumstances in the recent past, such that </p>
<p>he feared he might die. It takes little imagination to suggest that Paul </p>
<p>in writing Ephesians contemplated his own death while imprisoned in </p>
<p>Rome. It is a testimony to his convictions that in both 2 Corinthians and </p>
<p>Ephesians his response was praise. Acts 16:24–25 relays Paul and Silas’ </p>
<p>prison worship of songs and prayers, further supporting the picture that </p>
<p>when Paul was in dire straits, his instinct was to praise God. Moreover, in </p>
<p>Ephesians as in his other letters, Paul uses the thanksgiving to introduce </p>
<p>important ideas developed later in the epistle. In this case we nd faith, </p>
<p>love, and hope rooted in the Father, the Lord Jesus, and the Spirit, as well </p>
<p>as the believers’ knowledge and wisdom, and Christ’s surpassing power in </p>
<p>this age and the next.</p>
