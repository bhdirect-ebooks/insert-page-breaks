<p>God. is interpretation nds support in Col 1:12, where the cognate </p>
<p>noun is used in the phrase “to share in the inheritance of his people in </p>
<p>the kingdom of light.” If the latter interpretation is followed, we have Paul </p>
<p>explaining that the believers’ inheritance is established (predestined) by </p>
<p>God’s plan in Christ. Paul underscores the aspect of God’s predestined </p>
<p>plan to counter any hints that the appointment by lot was arbitrary from </p>
<p>God’s perspective. However, the verb is useful in its association with cast-</p>
<p>ing lots inasmuch as this reects Paul’s insistence that humans cannot win </p>
<p>through merit God’s gracious salvation. So from a human perspective, </p>
<p>God’s choice is not based on the world’s judgment of what is good (as Paul </p>
<p>indicates to the Corinthians in 1 Cor 1:26, not many of them were wise </p>
<p>or outstanding from a social standpoint). But from God’s perspective, the </p>
<p>choice always had his full will and wish behind it. Further support for this </p>
<p>reading is Paul’s description of the believer’s inheritance as assured by the </p>
<p>promised Holy Spirit which seals each member of Christ’s body (1:14).</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Election, Predestination, and Free Will</p>
<p>As noted above, much effort and debate has centered on the important ques-</p>
<p>tions of election, predestination, and human free will. Each age has entertained </p>
<p>a particular focus, from as far back as Origen’s debate with the Gnostics, and </p>
<p>Augustine’s argument with Pelagius. As each person and church fellowship </p>
<p>works through these crucial questions, I would offer a few points to keep in </p>
<p>mind. First, and probably most important, as we will see in Eph 3–6 (over </p>
<p>half of the letter), Paul insists that Christians live a moral life—and not just </p>
<p>because it is more pleasant to be around a moral person. Indeed Paul claims </p>
<p>that each believer is now a new person, clothed with Christ, a “new man” (or </p>
<p>woman) who must mature in Christ (4:13). Any claims of human free will and </p>
<p>God’s sovereignty should make space for the real-time (present) necessity of </p>
<p>holy living. Second, and closely related to the ﬁrst, Paul does not place such </p>
emphasis on the individual as to relegate the corporate body secondary status.
<p>For Paul, there is no isolated believer—all can only function in community. </p>
Any discussion of election must include appreciation for both individual and
<p>corporate membership in God’s salvation plan. Third, down through the centu-</p>
<p>ries it has been tempting to see election and predestination through dualistic </p>
lens, whereby an individual’s soul is elected and it ﬂoats to heaven at death.
