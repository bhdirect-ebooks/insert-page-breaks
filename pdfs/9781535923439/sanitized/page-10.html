<p>Preface</p>
<p>x</p>
<p>cere appreciation goes to the editorial team at Wipf and Stock, especially </p>
<p>Chris Spinks, who made the publishing process smooth and ecient. I </p>
<p>am indebted to Wheaton College and my dean, Jill Baumgaertner, and as-</p>
<p>sociate dean, Jerey Greenman, for providing release time to pursue this </p>
<p>delightful project. I am deeply grateful to my colleague Michael Graves </p>
<p>for our fruitful dialogues on the Greek text of Ephesians. My teaching </p>
<p>assistant, Adam Cieszkiewicz, exceeded the call of duty in his diligent re-</p>
<p>search, proofreading, and insightful suggestions for content in the Fusing </p>
<p>the Horizons sections. I am truly thankful for the loving support of my </p>
<p>children, Sarah and C. J. I dedicate this book to my husband, Jim, who has </p>
<p>never failed to love me “just as Christ loved the church and gave himself </p>
<p>for her” (Eph 5:25).</p>
