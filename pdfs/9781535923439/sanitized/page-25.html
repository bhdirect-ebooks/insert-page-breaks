<p>“in” followed by a blank space, nonetheless, if Tychicus was instructed to </p>
<p>insert the name of the city when he read it to the churches, there would </p>
<p>be little need to leave a space in the actual text. We might pause for a mo-</p>
<p>ment and note that Paul gives Tychicus the responsibility to inform the </p>
<p>listeners of his situation (this is true as well in Colossians). It seems that </p>
<p>Paul instructed his envoys to communicate more than what was on the </p>
<p>page, for example when he reveals in 2 Cor 7:6–16 that he expected Titus </p>
<p>to reassure the Corinthians of Paul’s concern for them. Again, the cus-</p>
<p>tom of reading the letter publicly to the church was apparently consistent </p>
<p>throughout Pauline churches. Even a letter as personal as Philemon was </p>
<p>read to the entire church, as indicated by the plural “you” at the beginning </p>
<p>and end of the letter. Furthermore, the instructions that Tychicus give </p>
<p>details of Paul’s situation (in chains) suggests that the apparent lack of </p>
<p>personal details in Ephesians itself might be counterbalanced by Tychicus </p>
and by Paul’s personal knowledge of individual communities surrounding
<p>Ephesus. Paul’s situation in prison might have prevented him from writ-</p>
ing individual letters, but would not prevent Tychicus from passing along
<p>specic greetings and encouragements directed orally by Paul through </p>
<p>him. An intriguing, but limited parallel could be drawn with contempo-</p>
<p>rary papyrus invitations, many of which lack the name of the addressee. </p>
<p>ese one-line invitations to a birthday party, wedding, or other festivity </p>
<p>depended upon the messenger to include the guest’s name at the time the </p>
<p>invitation was read to them.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>In the end, it seems the evidence is weighed</p>
<p>slightly in favor of the letter being addressed to the church in Ephesus, </p>
<p>but given Paul’s encouragement to the Colossians to share their letter with </p>
<p>the Laodiceans, it is entirely possible that Tychicus, as he traveled from </p>
<p>Ephesus to Colossae, read Paul’s letter to the Ephesians to the satellite </p>
<p>Christian communities orbiting around the central city of Ephesus.</p>
<p>Support for this possibility might come from 1 Corinthians, which </p>
<p>was penned in Ephesus (1 Cor 16:8). In 1 Cor 16:19, Paul extends greet-</p>
<p>ings from the churches in the province of Asia, which may signal that he </p>
<p>sees the Ephesian Christian community not limited to the city limits, but </p>
<p>extending to the towns beyond. “Paul here seems to imply . . . that the </p>
<p>Christian community of Ephesus was the central Christian community </p>
<p>of the province. . . . is suggests that the Ephesian Christian community </p>
<p>was a missionary centre, and maintained contact with Christians in other </p>
