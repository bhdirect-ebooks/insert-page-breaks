<p>active, even though sin’s power has been put to death on the cross. e </p>
<p>gravitational pull of sin is greatly lessened if the believer is clothed in the </p>
<p>new person who was created in the likeness of God (4:24). We have a </p>
<p>saying that “the clothes make the man (or woman)” and a similar senti-</p>
<p>ment applies to believers, for in both cases the clothing aects the person’s </p>
<p>own mental picture of themselves. Isn’t that why young children love to </p>
<p>dress up as super heroes or knights or princesses—the feeling of power </p>
<p>attached with their outt? So too a believer who dresses themselves in </p>
<p>Christ knows themselves to be dierent, changed, more fully equipped to </p>
<p>do their ministry.</p>
Yet, are they powered by their own energy? Or is divine agency
<p>present as well? Paul stresses God’s role in revealing truth and generat-</p>
<p>ing wisdom and knowledge upon which believers can act. Moreover, Paul </p>
<p>insists that believers do not simply know about Christ, but they learned </p>
<p>Christ and were taught in him (4:20–21). Finally, Paul notes that the spirit </p>
<p>of their minds is being renewed (4:23). In using the passive voice, most </p>
<p>likely here Paul speaks of their spirit being renewed by the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p>Paul once again emphasizes the inextricable connection between head </p>
<p>and heart, between a renewed mind and a reformed lifestyle. Knowing </p>
<p>about Christ keeps the Savior at a distance, but knowing Christ invites a </p>
<p>radical reorganization of one’s view of reality and priorities.</p>
<p>e promise in this section is that the believer is a new person (see </p>
<p>also 2 Cor 5:17). e new person belongs to the new age; he or she is a </p>
<p>citizen of heaven (Phil 3:20). She is destined for glory, and is now sealed </p>
with the Spirit for that Day. So far, I have painted a very individualistic
<p>picture, which is only half of the story for Paul. Paul speaks of believers </p>
<p>growing mature, by which he means that they grow as a body into their </p>
<p>head, Christ (4:15). Christians understand themselves not simply as one </p>
<p>with God in Christ, but as one with other members of Christ’s body. In </p>
<p>Africa, there is a saying, “I am because we are.” is proverb sums up well </p>
<p>Paul’s mindset concerning believers. A Christian is not merely one who is </p>
<p>saved in Christ, but is one who simultaneously is a member with others in </p>
<p>Christ’s body, the church. One cannot be a body-less Christian, in Paul’s </p>
<p>imagination. For him, the reality of Christ’s body, made up of this new </p>
<p>person (neither Jew nor Gentile), speaks to the reality of each member’s </p>
<p>resurrection hope.</p>
<p>Paul gets practical in his advice in 4:25–32. Notice that the injunc-</p>
<p>tions to godly behavior have to do with interpersonal relationships. Paul </p>
