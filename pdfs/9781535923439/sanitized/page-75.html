<p>Raised with Christ</p>

<p>Raised with Christ (2:1–10)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this </p>
<p>world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit </p>
<p>who is now at work in those who are disobedient. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>All of us </p>
<p>also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of </p>
<p>our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts. Like </p>
<p>the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>But because </p>
<p>of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>made us </p>
<p>alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—</p>
<p>it is by grace you have been saved. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>And God raised us up </p>
<p>with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in </p>
<p>Christ Jesus, </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>in order that in the coming ages he might show </p>
<p>the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kind-</p>
<p>ness to us in Christ Jesus. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>For it is by grace you have been </p>
<p>saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the </p>
<p>gi of God—</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>not by works, so that no one can boast. </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>For </p>
<p>we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good </p>
<p>works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.</p>
<p>ese ten verses contain crucial theological truth, ethical challenge, and </p>
<p>exegetical puzzles. To understand the former two, we need to pay atten-</p>
<p>tion to the latter. One central question aecting the reading is Paul’s use </p>
<p>of the pronouns “you” and “we.” If we attend carefully to these pronouns, </p>
<p>the depth of Paul’s argument will become clearer.</p>
<p>You and We in Paul’s Argument</p>
<p>Who are the “you” in Paul’s argument? While of course the scripture </p>
<p>speaks to each of us, and we can all place ourselves in the shoes of the </p>
<p>“you” who are dead in trespasses and sins (2:1), Paul has in mind here not </p>
<p>the generic human, but the Gentile. It is the Gentile who lived as part of </p>
<p>this present age, ruled by evil forces and sinful attitudes. is age is domi-</p>
<p>nated by abuse of power, greed, hatred—summed up as disobedience </p>
<p>against God. In 2:3 Paul shis his gaze from Gentile to Jew, and notes that </p>
<p>“we” Jews are not innocent of wrongdoing, because we operated under the </p>
