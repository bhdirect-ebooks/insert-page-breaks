<p>slavery, but had been free men with social standing (before pirates or a military </p>
<p>defeat changed their fate).</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> Thus even at this time, the theoretical underpin-</p>
<p>nings of slavery were a bit shaky. That said, for the most part, philosophers </p>
<p>only chided slave owners to refrain from brutalizing their slaves because, </p>
<p>they argued, these slaves were human beings, after all. This is the burden of </p>
<p>Seneca’s lengthy discussion about the mistreatment of slaves.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> After he de-</p>
<p>cries the debauchery and excess of owners, which speaks of their own slavery </p>
<p>to their passions, he states that vicious beatings do nothing to make a slave </p>
<p>better at his task. Seneca declares that the owner should not expect his slave </p>
<p>to fear him, but respect him. Yet when his imaginary interlocutor exclaims that </p>
<p>Seneca has essentially awarded the slave manumission, Seneca disagrees. He </p>
<p>steps away from the possibility that the institution of slavery is ﬂawed, content </p>
<p>to state only that the hierarchy is acceptable, and should not be abused. </p>
<p>The reasons preventing the next step from being taken include the economic </p>
<p>role of slaves, especially in Rome, and a conviction that a slave was born or </p>
<p>destined by fate to be a slave. However, because people could move in and out </p>
<p>of slavery for a number of reasons, it was difﬁcult to state categorically that a </p>
<p>male slave’s soul was discernibly different from a freeborn male’s. And so the </p>
<p>tension remained, as did the institution of slavery.</p>
<p>A similar tension was faced about 150 years ago in the United States, </p>
<p>with abolitionists pitted against those who supported the institution of slavery. </p>
<p>The reasons for the Civil War are many and varied, but our purpose here </p>
<p>is to call attention to the theological debates that engaged both Northern </p>
<p>and Southern Christians. The country faced a theological crisis, not because </p>
<p>people did not believe in God or the Bible, but because their hermeneutical </p>
<p>tools left them unprepared to deal with this social issue. Their difﬁculties in </p>
<p>part lay in their assumption that the Bible was a simple book that took only </p>
<p>common sense to interpret. This led to ignoring the Bible’s own historical </p>
<p>context and social assumptions, and instead reading it as though it was a set </p>
<p>of propositions to be applied trans-culturally. Today we require an agile herme-</p>
<p>neutic that contends with context without being completely determined by it.</p>
