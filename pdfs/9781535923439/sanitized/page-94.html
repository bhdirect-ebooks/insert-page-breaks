<p>EphEsians 3</p>
<p>Aer the heavy theological liing of chs. 1 and 2, ch. 3 carries a slower, </p>
<p>more repetitive pace. It is as though, having chugged steadily up the steep </p>
<p>theological hill, Paul is pausing a bit to allow his readers to catch their </p>
<p>breath, before plunging on with his exhortations in chs. 4–6. Key terms </p>
<p>and phrases are carried over or expanded. For example, Paul repeats </p>
<p>the foundational importance of the apostles and prophets, and further </p>
<p>describes the unique, amazing composition of God’s church—Jew and </p>
<p>Gentile together in Christ. In ch. 3, Paul describes how his personal story </p>
<p>is related to the gospel message explained in the preceding chapters. He </p>
<p>also highlights one ramication of God’s marvelous plan of redemption—</p>
<p>that we (Jew and Gentile) may freely and condently pray to God with </p>
<p>utter assurance of being welcomed and heard (3:12). From a structural </p>
standpoint, ch. 3 can be divided in half, with the rst section concerned
<p>with Paul’s self-description and the second with Paul’s prayer for the </p>
<p>Ephesians. Paul explains his potentially shameful position of being in </p>
<p>chains as glorious for the Gentiles in light of God’s redemptive work in </p>
<p>Christ. His prayer centers on the reality of the new, inner person who is </p>
<p>created in Christ from every family (both Jew and Gentile). Paul prays </p>
<p>that this new believer might be saturated inside and out to the bursting </p>
<p>point with Christ’s love and God’s fullness.</p>
<p>Paul, a Prisoner in Chains (3:1–13)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the </p>
<p>sake of you Gentiles—</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Surely you have heard about the </p>
<p>administration of God’s grace that was given to me for you, </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I </p>
<p>have already written briey. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>In reading this, then, you will </p>
<p>be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>which was not made known to people in other generations </p>
