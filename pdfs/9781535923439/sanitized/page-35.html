<p>Introduction</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>one named in the text, and thus the text’s author could be categorized as </p>
<p>pseudonymous. A key concern when speaking of pseudonymity is the </p>
<p>intention of the authors; namely, are they intending to deceive their audi-</p>
<p>ence, or are they using an accepted literary device? Intentions are not </p>
<p>always easy to determine, but two were commented upon in the ancient </p>
<p>world: greed and admiration for the author. Some writers were anxious </p>
<p>to have their own ideas propagated, and so used a well-known name to </p>
<p>forward the writer’s cause, while others genuinely appreciated the person </p>
<p>whose name they used, and sought to promote that person’s ideas out of </p>
<p>love, respect, and personal humility. Forgery is another category; here the </p>
<p>author intentionally deceives his audience for some perceived gain, which </p>
<p>might be wealth, or the downfall of his opponent. In the case of pseud-</p>
<p>onymous authorship, the audience is not deceived; rather it recognizes </p>
<p>without censure the false authorship attribution.</p>
<p>A quick summary of the pseudepigraphic epistolary collections in the </p>
<p>Greco-Roman world reveals that they were the product of several authors, </p>
<p>or at least an accumulation of material surrounding an authentic core. </p>
<p>ese collections developed in the rst and second centuries CE, perhaps </p>
<p>because of the general, widespread interest in classical Greek thought and </p>
<p>literary expression. e gures chosen had well-known reputations, and </p>
<p>the letter collections might be read alongside their corpus of work. In </p>
almost all cases the letters were written to a single individual, another
<p>well-known person of the past. Moreover, composing letters in the name </p>
<p>of famous philosophers, tyrants, and kings was standard rhetoric training </p>
<p>for students. “e goal of the pseudonymous epistolographer was thus to </p>
<p>work the bare bones of a biography into a compelling life story. He was </p>
<p>both scholar and creative artist, researching historical materials in order </p>
<p>to dene the bounds of the tradition, and using his imagination to elabo-</p>
<p>rate creatively and dramatically on that tradition.”</p>

<p>It must be noted that</p>
<p>these letters were not read singly, but within the corpus, and the evidence </p>
<p>suggests a school setting for their production. For these reasons, a few ar-</p>
<p>gued that the disputed Pauline letters were produced by a Pauline school, </p>
<p>although this view has never gained much traction due to the paucity of </p>
<p>evidence for such an academy.</p>
<p>Additionally, many of these collections focus on ethics and imitating </p>
<p>the famous gure. To facilitate these goals, oen the letters include person-</p>
