<p>EphEsians 2</p>
<p>With the exception of John 3:16, perhaps the most famous passage in </p>
<p>Scripture is “by grace you have been saved, through faith,” found in Eph </p>
<p>2:8 (see also 2:6). e challenge is to hear this verse anew, to have it speak </p>
<p>afresh. With that goal in mind, let us imagine ourselves as part of an </p>
<p>early second-century Christian church in a little town about een miles </p>
<p>from Ephesus, a small community of perhaps a dozen or so like-minded </p>
<p>Gentiles. We heard the gospel from a traveling missionary, and had a copy </p>
<p>of Ephesians as our main guide to the Christian life. Paul’s letters to the </p>
<p>Romans, the Corinthians, the Philippians and the essalonians were un-</p>
<p>known to our tiny group. What would our Christian life look like, what </p>
<p>would be its major contours and emphases?</p>
<p>As we have seen, the resounding note that rings loudly in the open-</p>
<p>ing chapter of the epistle, which reverberates and echoes in the remaining </p>
<p>chapters, is God’s amazing plan of sonship for his people through Christ </p>
<p>as part of an overarching design to redeem and renew creation. Chapter </p>
<p>2 picks up the melody line, and adds accompaniment, lling out the </p>
<p>purposes of God for the church. I think our second-century community </p>
<p>would expect that the gospel gives new hope by granting membership </p>
<p>into a special group—the people of God. Salvation by faith was viewed </p>
<p>as having two dimensions to it, equally important and explaining each </p>
<p>other. Salvation in Christ took our little group from the kingdom of dark-</p>
<p>ness to the kingdom of light by giving each of us new life in Christ. is </p>
<p>new life in the new kingdom was actually a new humanity, realized in </p>
<p>Christ through the Spirit by faith. Salvation was understood by these early </p>
believers not only in individualistic terms, nor as merely a private deci-
<p>sion, nor as something that aected only the human soul. Paul instructs </p>
<p>all believers that salvation brings us into God’s family, it makes us part of </p>
<p>his holy temple, and its blessings usher us into the next, new age.</p>
