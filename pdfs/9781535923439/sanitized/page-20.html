<p>concerning authorship. Nor does the statement that Paul was a prisoner </p>
<p>suggest pseudonymity. Paul notes in 2 Cor 11:23 that he has been impris-</p>
<p>oned numerous times. He speaks of himself as a prisoner in Phlm 1, 9, </p>
<p>and as being in chains in Col 4:3, 18. Acts 16:23–26 indicates that Paul </p>
<p>was put in stocks, chained in an inner part of the prison in Philippi. e </p>
<p>evidence raises at least two questions: Would someone writing in Paul’s </p>
<p>name have included his claims of imprisonment? And were these chains </p>
<p>seen in a positive or negative light? Looking at the rst question, did </p>
<p>Paul’s numerous imprisonments become a leitmotif of Paul’s life such that </p>
<p>any person writing decades aer Paul would need to include reference to </p>
<p>his chains? is answer is related to our second question, which might be </p>
<p>answered in one of two ways, based on how we understand Paul’s chains </p>
<p>to be understood within the early church. In the larger society, being in </p>
<p>chains was shameful; Paul likewise recognized that his chains could be </p>
<p>understood in this way.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>But he also celebrates them as a symbol of his</p>
<p>apostleship and faithful witness to the gospel message’s power to upset the </p>
<p>religious and social status quo. One might argue that it would be rather </p>
<p>presumptuous for an author to remake Paul’s actual chains into a literary </p>
<p>theme which served to encourage boldness and faithfulness in service to </p>
<p>Christ. In the letters to Philemon and Colossae Paul reects deeply on </p>
the reality of his chains; thus “for individuals to write in Paul’s name and
<p>bind themselves, guratively, with Paul’s chains, a considerable audacity </p>
<p>would be required.”</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Cassidy raises an important point oen overlooked</p>
<p>in authorship discussions, namely the fact that if Paul did not write the </p>
<p>letter, then whoever did sought to speak not only with the apostle’s voice, </p>
<p>but with the authority of one who was in chains for Christ. ose claim-</p>
<p>ing deutero-Pauline status usually explain that the disciple was writing </p>
<p>in Paul’s name to bring Paul’s ethics and theology up to date for the new </p>
<p>generation of believers. Surely that could be done without also assuming </p>
<p>the moral authority of one who suered so specically and for such dura-</p>
<p>tion as Paul. e moral implications of claiming the voice of one who </p>
<p>suered greatly should give pause to the suggestions that one of Paul’s </p>
<p>own followers would strike such a pose.</p>
<p>roughout both the disputed and undisputed Pauline letters, we </p>
<p>have the author declaring that he is writing to his congregations, and to-</p>
