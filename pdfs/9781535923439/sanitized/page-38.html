<p>with the addition of works claiming to be their own. Herodotus explains </p>
<p>that Onomacritus was exiled from Athens for adding to the oracles of </p>
<p>Musaeus.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>Diogenes Laertius notes that the Stoic Diotimus wrote y</p>
<p>obscene letters in his opponent Epicurus’ name, attempting to ruin his </p>
<p>reputation.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>But notice also in Galen’s story above that at least some</p>
<p>ancient readers asked questions of authorship by examining the style of </p>
<p>a work compared to known authentic texts. Suetonius echoes the same </p>
<p>sentiment in his critique of some works in the Homer corpus that he </p>
<p>identies as not genuine because they are both common and obscure, </p>
<p>that is, their style and grammar did not match that of the genuine works </p>
<p>of Homer. “What emerges clearly is the widespread use of pseudonymity </p>
<p>in Greco-Roman antiquity, a literary practice well-regarded by some but </p>
<p>held in contempt by others.”</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>Plato’s Noble Falsehood</p>
<p>Alongside the question of intellectual property is Plato’s concept of a </p>
<p>noble falsehood. e idea taught that if a fabrication would help a person, </p>
<p>then it was acceptable for someone to tell a lie. e example oen given </p>
<p>by the ancient authors themselves was of a physician who, in order to help </p>
<p>the patient, would lie about a remedy so that the patient would follow </p>
<p>orders and thus be healed. Some argue that the early church would have </p>
<p>accepted a pseudepigraphic letter if its content was in line with apostolic </p>
<p>thought, because the message mattered more than the medium. While it </p>
<p>is true that a few church fathers speak favorably of the noble falsehood, </p>
<p>the contexts dier so greatly from the issues of apostolic writings so as </p>
<p>to limit their usefulness in the argument. For example, Chrysostom ap-</p>
<p>proves of the noble falsehood, but the context is his “lie” to his friend </p>
<p>concerning their joining the priesthood.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>He explains why he was not</p>
<p>straightforward about his own actions in the matter, but notes that he ob-</p>
<p>fuscated his position for his friend’s greater good. Again, Origen admits </p>
<p>that the noble falsehood is a logically conceivable way of understanding </p>
