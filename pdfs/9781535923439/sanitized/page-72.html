<p>and blameless in love, later in ch. 1 their actions are covered by, energized </p>
<p>by, understood through love. Also, God intends that his inheritance is a </p>
<p>people for the praise of his glory. Believers are those who live in hope; </p>
<p>here is Paul’s eschatology peaking through. Believers are to live in God’s </p>
<p>power, which encompasses Christ’s death, the forgiveness of sins, and the </p>
<p>resurrection. e great power that raised the dead Jesus will also raise </p>
<p>each believer; this is our inheritance. e power is greater than any imag-</p>
<p>inable, for it takes account of this world and the next.</p>
<p>In the last three verses of ch. 1, Paul reects on the greatness of </p>
<p>Christ in several ways. First, he notes that Christ is seated at God’s right </p>
<p>hand, the place of special commendation in the ancient world (Ps 110:1). </p>
<p>Second, Paul notes that Christ’s place is above every spiritual power, in </p>
<p>this world and the world to come. is must be the case, otherwise our </p>
<p>resurrection cannot be assured, for the possibility might exist that in the </p>
<p>age to come, Christ’s power would be insucient against the spiritual </p>
<p>forces. Paul assures believers that the future will hold no surprises. e </p>
<p>subordination of all powers has occurred; they are under his feet, and he </p>
<p>is their head. ird, Christ is head over all things “to the church,” which </p>
<p>is in the dative. e sense here is dicult to determine. It may be a da-</p>
<p>tive of advantage, which would mean that Christ is head “for the church.” </p>
<p>But the dative could indicate indirect object, which would indicate that </p>
<p>God gave Christ as head to the church. e dative might be a dative of </p>
<p>instrument, that God appointed Christ as head so that he could rule all </p>
<p>things through the church. Fourth, the church is described as Christ’s </p>
<p>body, an image Paul will continue to develop in the epistle. Finally, the </p>
<p>nal clause describes the fullness of the one lling all in all. Does this </p>
<p>“fullness” refer to the church or Christ? If the former, then the church is </p>
<p>the receptacle of Christ’s fullness, and also continues to be lled by God. </p>
<p>In this interpretation, believers represent Christ not simply as forgiven </p>
<p>sinners, but as containing within the church the fullness of God’s plan of </p>
<p>redemption, the rst scent of hope and promise to a world decaying in </p>
<p>sin. e church is integral to God’s plan in Christ to make known to the </p>
<p>powers now and in the age to come His greatness and glory. If, however, </p>
<p>we see “fullness” referring to Christ, the accent is on Christ completely </p>
<p>lling all things. In this reading, Christ’s body can be characterized as </p>
<p>representing his fullness. e former reading makes better sense of the </p>
<p>latter terms in the clause, namely that God is the one who lls all in all. </p>
<p>Although it is a dicult passage to interpret, the most likely reading of </p>
