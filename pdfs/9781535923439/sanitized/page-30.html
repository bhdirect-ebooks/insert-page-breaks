<p>tion, where, interestingly, we also nd Paul describing himself as God’s am-</p>
<p>bassador, a term used in Eph 6:20 (“ambassador in chains”). Justication </p>
<p>is a central concept in Romans and Galatians, but Paul does not use it in </p>
<p>Colossians or the essalonian correspondence, and in 1 Corinthians the </p>
<p>noun occurs only once (1:30), and the verb “to justify” twice (4:4, 6:11). </p>
<p>e absence, then, of this particular word group should not disqualify </p>
<p>Ephesians as Pauline. Additionally, the claim that Ephesians holds a real-</p>
<p>ized eschatology fails to consider adequately both the future expectations </p>
<p>noted in the epistle, as well as the use of the past tense by Paul in other </p>
<p>letters when dealing with salvation. In 4:30, we nd reference to the com-</p>
<p>ing day of redemption, a future event (see also 1:10), as well as mention </p>
<p>of the age to come in 1:21 and 2:7. Additionally, in Romans we discover </p>
<p>Paul explaining the hope by which a believer is saved (past tense, 8:24) </p>
<p>as well as declaring, also in the past tense, Christian brothers and sisters </p>
<p>predestined, called, justied, and gloried (8:30). Speaking more broadly </p>
<p>about eschatology, some suggest that in Ephesians Christ’s imminent sec-</p>
<p>ond coming has receded to the background, and shoved to the forefront </p>
<p>is Paul’s concern with the here and now. To substantiate this claim, the </p>
<p>household code (Eph 5:21—6:9) is contrasted with 1 Cor 7:7 and Paul’s </p>
<p>encouragement later in 7:29–31 to refrain from marriage because the time </p>
<p>is short. is contention, however, fails to appreciate fully the context of </p>
<p>each argument. In 1 Corinthians, Paul faces a community struggling with </p>
<p>issues of sexuality, and it seems that some married couples are refrain-</p>
<p>ing from sex with each other (7:1–5), although perhaps some husbands </p>
<p>are visiting prostitutes (6:15–18). Moreover, the Corinthians downplayed </p>
<p>the eschatological future in Christ, leaving Paul to insist upon it at every </p>
<p>opportunity. Ephesians does not address sexual immorality or confusion </p>
<p>within marriage; rather, it describes the institution in light of Christ and </p>
<p>the church. And within the description is a forward looking emphasis, </p>
<p>namely that the purpose of Christ’s death was to make the church holy </p>
<p>and blameless (see also 2 Cor 11:2). e church is not presently holy or </p>
<p>blameless (at least as Paul describes the behaviors of believers in his let-</p>
<p>ters!), but Paul is consistent with the larger New Testament picture of the </p>
<p>church as the bride of Christ who, in the Last Day, will be presented to </p>
<p>Christ (Matt 22:1–10; 25:1–13; Rev 19:7–10; 21:9). A nal point concern-</p>
<p>ing eschatology in Ephesians: Paul’s command to put on the armor of </p>
<p>God to ght against the powers and principalities (6:10–20) would be </p>
<p>nonsensical if he believed that Christ had already defeated such powers, </p>
