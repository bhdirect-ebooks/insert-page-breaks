<p>Ephesians 4:7–16</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>measure as standard and the genitive as one of apposition. In this case, </p>
<p>Paul would be arguing that believers should measure themselves against </p>
<p>the standard of the faith, the gospel message, with the implication that </p>
<p>since all are saved only by God’s grace, no believer has reason to think </p>
<p>more highly of herself.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>is faith, this gospel, is the standard by which</p>
<p>we should judge ourselves. Following this reasoning, Paul takes a turn </p>
<p>in Rom 12:6, wherein he introduces the term “dierent,” which modies </p>
<p>“gis” (charismata), not “grace.” e point is that believers have dierent </p>
<p>gis, but they all spring from the same grace of 12:3. In sum, grace is the </p>
<p>unifying point and the faith is the standard raised in 12:3, from which </p>
<p>dierent gis spring forth for the edication of the body of Christ.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Returning to Ephesians, Paul stresses in 4:7 the unity of the body; </p>
<p>he is not speaking about dierences of gis, as he does in 1 Corinthians </p>
<p>and Rom 12:6 noted above. Instead, Paul continues his discussion of the </p>
<p>one church, in which all believers have the same grace in the same mea-</p>
<p>sure. e result is that we all as the body receive the gi of Christ, which </p>
<p>enables the body to grow. As we will see below in 4:11, Paul does not </p>
<p>address dierent gis; rather he indicates that the church receives aid for </p>
<p>its ministry in the form of apostles, prophets, and so on. To anticipate our </p>
<p>conclusion in 4:11, the gi is a collection of tools and resources that outt </p>
<p>believers to do ministry; those resources are called apostles, pastors, etc. </p>
<p>To walk worthy of our calling, we need wisdom and training in discern-</p>
<p>ment, which comes through prophets, evangelists, and teachers. Paul’s </p>
<p>thought ow continues with the theme of unity from 4:4 through 4:13. </p>
<p>Diversity, a key term in today’s discussions, reveals itself in the saints’ </p>
<p>ministry, wherein each member of the church works faithfully to build up </p>
<p>the body of Christ. Tolerance is another popular term today, but not one </p>
<p>I’d venture to say Paul would have accepted because for him the major </p>
<p>goal of each believer is not self-fulllment but being a growing member </p>
<p>of a strong, loving church.</p>

<p>4. Keener (2009: 145–46) holds that Rom 12:3–6 indicates God gives dierent faith </p>
<p>apportionments (not amounts) as pertains to the gis given. is view highlights the </p>
<p>similar phrases “metron of faith” in 12:3 and “analogian of faith” in 12:6. e conclusion </p>
<p>drawn is that the latter should not be translated as “standard of faith” as if in 12:6 Paul </p>
<p>limits the “analogian of faith” to the gi of prophecy, whereas in fact Paul believes that </p>
<p>God provides the kind of faith that energizes each kind of gi.</p>
