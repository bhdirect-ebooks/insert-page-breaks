<p>Ephesians 3:14–21</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>that God wants the holy lifestyle and is more than capable of supplying </p>
<p>the power to live out the new life in Christ. Additionally, it shows the </p>
<p>Ephesians that Paul’s upcoming requests are not pie-in-the-sky impos-</p>
<p>sible dreams that only few super-spiritual people can achieve. Instead, in </p>
<p>hearing Paul’s prayer, each believer is assured the reality of God’s power </p>
<p>in their inner person, the Spirit working and Christ dwelling, so that new </p>
<p>life ows naturally from their changed nature or status.</p>
<p>Paul describes his posture—kneeling—rather than stating directly </p>
<p>that he is praying. is vivid word picture has Old Testament resonances </p>
<p>for Paul. In Rom 14:11 and Phil 2:10, Paul draws on Isa 45:23 in his con-</p>
<p>victions that every knee will bow to honor Christ and God the Father </p>
<p>(see also Rom 11:4, citing 1 Kgs 19:18). Some suggest that the hymn in </p>
<p>Phil 2:5–11 was well known to Paul’s churches. If the Ephesians were also </p>
<p>aware of it, Paul’s posture before God would call to mind the promised </p>
<p>victory of Christ. Paul presents a picture of humility, but also one of tre-</p>
<p>mendous hope, for his bowed knee foreshadows the eschatological event </p>
<p>where all render appropriate obeisance to God. It is unclear whether </p>
<p>earliest Christians oen knelt in prayer, but perhaps the physical act of </p>
<p>kneeling today would be a useful reminder to believers of the eschatologi-</p>
<p>cal event in which God’s majesty will be honored by all.</p>
<p>Paul kneels before God the Father, a common appellation for God </p>
<p>in this letter. Most likely Paul uses it here because he wants to draw a </p>
<p>wordplay on that name (pater) and the term for family (patria). Every </p>
<p>family, those on earth and in heaven, draws their name from God. Paul </p>
<p>likely intends here that every human clan is ultimately from God, as God </p>
<p>is the creator of all (3:9). But what does Paul imply by speaking of every </p>
<p>family in heaven? Some argue he is referring to angels, although it would </p>
<p>seem an odd way to do so, as angels are not grouped as families. A bet-</p>
<p>ter option is that Paul is asserting that, in the end, separation by death </p>
(with the dead in heaven and others remaining on earth) does not divide
<p>families. Does this mean that Paul is thinking only of redeemed families? </p>
<p>Not necessarily; rather he presents the conviction that every family comes </p>
<p>under God’s redemptive plan; no one is le outside the all-encompassing </p>
<p>love of Christ, and all have access to it by faith. As indicated in 3:12, the </p>
<p>throne of grace is approachable to all through Christ.</p>
