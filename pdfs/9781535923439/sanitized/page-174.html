<p>Fusing the Horizons: Christian Nominalism and Life in the Spirit</p>
<p>160</p>
<p>Perhaps our desire for success, rooted in our pursuit of progress with </p>
<p>efﬁciency, has blinded us to the real goal of Christian life—obedience. Our </p>
<p>obedience matters not only in the world of human interactions but also in the </p>
<p>spiritual realm, for it brings glory to God. It shows the spiritual forces of evil </p>
<p>and darkness that God reigns supreme and that he has the power to do the </p>
<p>impossible, namely provide grace for humans to live righteously. Obedience, </p>
<p>however, is not simply a matter of the will, for if we think in those terms, </p>
<p>then we are on our way to assuming right living is our own doing. We need </p>
<p>to be meditating and reﬂecting at the foot of the cross, the place where sins </p>
<p>are forgiven, where we have been saved to do good works in God’s grace. The </p>
<p>sword of the Spirit—the word of God—is most clearly spoken in the cross, </p>
<p>as Paul says in Eph 1:7–9. The message of the Beloved One (1:6), whose </p>
<p>death and resurrection is our peace (2:14), is the gospel, which cuts through </p>
<p>darkness. This peace is secure, for Christ’s love and victory are eternal. But </p>
<p>this peace is also fragile in that we are apt to take it for granted. This is why </p>
<p>Paul insists that we continually pray and petition God, and keep watch for </p>
<p>each other (6:18–20), so that the powers of darkness might not envelop the </p>
<p>believing community.</p>
<p>Closing Remarks (6:21–24)</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Tychicus, the dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord, </p>
<p>will tell you everything, so that you also may know how I am </p>
<p>and what I am doing. </p>
<p>22</p>
<p>I am sending him to you for this very </p>
<p>purpose, that you may know how we are, and that he may </p>
<p>encourage you. </p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Peace to the brothers and sisters, and love </p>
<p>with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undy-</p>
<p>ing love.</p>
<p>Paul’s closing remarks are almost exactly the same as the wording in Col </p>
<p>4:7–8. e dierences include an opening clause in Ephesians, as well </p>
<p>as an additional note about “what I [Paul] am doing.” In Colossians, we </p>
<p>read the additional characterization of Tychicus as a fellow slave with </p>
<p>Paul in the Lord. e close verbal equivalence leads many to suggest </p>
<p>that Ephesians copied from Colossians, based on the prior decision that </p>
