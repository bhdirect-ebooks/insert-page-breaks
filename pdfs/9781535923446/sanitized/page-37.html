<p>vine beings. e sound of prais[es] . . . coming out of each of their </p>
divisions on [both] sides, and each of the mustered troops rejoices,
<p>one by one in order of rank . . .</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>Also central to the discussion is the meaning of the Greek word thrēskeia </p>
<p>in Col 2:18. F. O. Francis argues that in 4 Macc 5:7 and Josephus Ant. </p>
<p>12.253 the word thrēskeia is used for the “worship” that belongs to the </p>
<p>Jews, not worship of the Jews. He applies it similarly to Col 2:18 as mean-</p>
<p>ing “worship” belonging to the angels, i.e., worship performed by the </p>
<p>angels.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>Clinton Arnold correctly notes, however, that “A survey of the</p>
usage of thrēskeia fails to turn up one example of a divine being, or a
<p>typical object of worship . . . related to thrēskeia in the genitive case that </p>
<p>should be taken as a subjective genitive.”</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>While this may be true, we</p>
<p>have already documented evidence of seers claiming to have partaken </p>
<p>of heavenly worship with angelic beings. What is more, Arnold’s other-</p>
<p>wise erudite study ounders on the observation that thrēskeia was not </p>
<p>used in any of the magical incantations involving angels that he cites and </p>
<p>there is no reference to incantations over angelic names in Colossians.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Alternatively, Loren Stuckenbruck points out there is no need to choose </p>
<p>absolutely between an objective genitive (“worshipping the angels”) </p>
<p>and a subjective genitive (“worship performed by the angels”) because </p>
<p>if someone is insisting on the benets attained by seeing angelic wor-</p>
<p>ship, then they are also attributing something special and majestic to the </p>
<p>angels themselves. e problem is not only the superuity of the ritual </p>
<p>and vision for the believer, but also the temptation to venerate angels en-</p>
<p>countered in the ascent.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>In fact, gaining access to worship of the angels</p>
<p>by ascetic practices and appeasing the angels by law observance are not </p>
<p>mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>A further factor in favor of dening the philosophy as tied with </p>
<p>Jewish mysticism is the use of the word embateuō in 2:18. e word, </p>
<p>though ambiguous, seems to be linked to visionary reports of “enter-</p>
<p>ing into” or “going into detail about” heavenly ascents and what is seen </p>
<p>therein (see 1 En. 14:9).</p>
