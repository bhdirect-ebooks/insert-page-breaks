<p>Fusing the Horizons: Ministerial Formation</p>

<p>auditorium after last night’s activities, or perhaps even reminding someone </p>
<p>of a charitable act done towards them when a favor needs to be returned. </p>
<p>Any ecclesial setting where people need help, direction, and mediation will </p>
<p>always necessitate some kind of pastoral persuasion. There can be a ﬁne line </p>
<p>between motivation and manipulation. The difference comes down to intent, </p>
<p>matters of self-interest, and the vulnerability of persons in question. The eth-</p>
<p>ics of pastoral persuasion are a matter for “practical theology.” Sufﬁce to say, </p>
<p>in the letter to Philemon, Paul provides an example of how to gently prod </p>
<p>persons into doing something that is best for themselves, best for others, and </p>
<p>ultimately glorifying of God.</p>
