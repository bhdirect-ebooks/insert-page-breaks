<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>When I open the chapel doors of the Epistle to the Colossians it is </p>
<p>as if Johann Sebastian himself sat at the organ.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>e singular loiness of the mind of Paul, though it may be seen </p>
<p>to greater advantage in his other writings which treat of weightier </p>
<p>matters, is also attested by this Epistle [to Philemon], in which, </p>
<p>while he handles a subject otherwise low and mean, he rises to </p>
<p>God with his wonted elevation. Sending back a runaway slave and </p>
<p>thief, he supplicates pardon for him. But in pleading this cause, he </p>
<p>discourses about Christian forbearance with such ability, that he </p>
<p>appears to speak about the interests of the whole Church rather </p>
than the private aairs of a single individual. On behalf of a man of
<p>the lowest condition, he demeans himself so modestly and hum-</p>
<p>bly, that nowhere else is the meekness of his temper painted in a </p>
<p>more lively manner.</p>

<p>City of Colossae</p>
<p>Colossae was a city in the Lycus Valley located within southwestern </p>
<p>Phrygia in the interior of Asia Minor. Colossae was once a densely </p>
<p>populated and wealthy city according to Xenophon, a city through which </p>
<p>Xerxes and his army passed in 480 BCE.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>e Greek geographer Strabo</p>
<p>described Colossae in his time as a polisma, or small city.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>In 133 BCE the</p>
<p>last king of Pergamum bequeathed his kingdom to the Romans who later </p>
<p>reorganized it as the province of Asia. e Lycus Valley was eventually in-</p>
<p>corporated into the Roman Empire and remained so for many centuries. </p>
<p>By Paul’s time Colossae was dwarfed by the larger cities of Hierapolis and </p>
<p>Laodicea also in the Lycus Valley.</p>
