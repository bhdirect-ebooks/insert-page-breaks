<p>and carried away from the nest and dumped. The ant would return to the nest </p>
<p>and resume work only to have the same process repeated again and again. </p>
<p>This provides a ﬁne analogy for Christians who live between the ages and have </p>
<p>a life that is hid with Messiah in God but also wait to be revealed with Messiah </p>
<p>in glory (Col 3:3–4). They are to put death earthly things even if they are not </p>
<p>quite dead yet. What is more, the goal for these ethical precepts is not to im-</p>
prove the individual’s respective standing before God, but to contribute to the
<p>state of the community as one that abounds in thanksgiving and exudes love. </p>
The distinctions that divide, whether ethnic or economic, have no place in the
<p>spiritual quickening that accompanies faith in Messiah. Thus, the constitutive </p>
<p>aspect for ethics in the new covenant community is new creation in-Messiah.</p>
