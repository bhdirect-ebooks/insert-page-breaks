<p>Colossians 2:8–15</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>thing (Heb 5.12) or to the material substances of the universe—earth, </p>
<p>water, air, and re (2 Pet 3:10, 12; Wis 7:17; 19:18).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>A further option is</p>
<p>to see them as cosmic powers. In line with this, fragmentary horoscopes </p>
<p>have been found in the Qumran writings that depict celestial bodies as </p>
<p>having a determining force (4Q186; 4Q534), and ancient persons were </p>
<p>interested in the power of astral planes and heavenly beings in control-</p>
<p>ling their destiny.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Jewish apocalyptic literature had already begun closely</p>
<p>associating the angels with the elements of the heavenly bodies (4 Ezra </p>
<p>6:3; Jub. 2:2; 1 En. 60:11–12; 74:1; 2 En. 4:1; T. Ab. 13:11).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Most likely,</p>
<p>the elemental forces denote hostile angelic entities equivalent to the “rul-</p>
<p>ers” and “authorities” mentioned elsewhere in Colossians (1:16; 2:15). </p>
<p>e description elemental forces of the cosmos might even be Paul’s own </p>
<p>designation for angelic mediators that require adoration, appeasement, </p>
and provide access to divine worship.
<p>9</p>
<p> In Galatians, the angels are explic-</p>
<p>itly linked to the giving of the law at Sinai (Gal 3:19; cf. Acts 7:53; Heb </p>
<p>2:2) showing that imposition of the law and the authority of the angels </p>
<p>are directly associated. Also in Galatians, Paul likens Gentiles turning to </p>
<p>the Torah to secure some form of protection, perfection, or prize as be-</p>
<p>ing equivalent to a return to slavery under pagan deities. e words of </p>
<p>eodoret of Cyr, though in the distant h century, are still relevant: </p>
<p>“ose who defend the law lead persons to worship angels, since they </p>
<p>say that the law was given through them. is vice persisted for a long </p>
<p>time in Phrygia and Pisidia, such that a synod gathered at Laodicea in </p>
<p>Phrygia laid down that angels should be not invoked.”</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>It is possible that</p>
<p>the philosophy has drawn on Jewish traditions about angels delivering the </p>
<p>law and angelic authority over the cosmic elements in order to commend </p>
<p>their religious practices to the Christians in Colossae in some esoteric </p>

<p>8. e document Testament of Solomon describes Solomon’s encounter with several </p>
<p>spirits who describe themselves thus: “We are the elements, the cosmic rulers of dark-</p>
<p>ness” (8:2), and “We are the thirty-six elements, the cosmic rulers of darkness of this age” </p>
<p>(18:2). ere is also the text from Vettius Valens 7.5: “I adjure you by Helios and Selene, </p>
<p>and by the courses of the ve stars . . . and by the four stoicheia” (cited from Arnold 1996: </p>
<p>165).</p>
