<p>the pathOs and persuasiOn </p>
<p>Of the apOstLe (8–22)</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> erefore, though I am bold enough in Messiah to com-</p>
<p>mand you to do what is tting </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>on account of love I prefer</p>
<p>to appeal to you—I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner </p>
<p>of Messiah Jesus—</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>I appeal to you concerning my child,</p>
<p>Onesimus, whom I gave birth to during imprisonment. </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>(Formerly he was useless to you, but now to you and to</p>
<p>me he is useful) </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>I am sending him, who is my very heart,</p>
<p>back to you. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>I wished to keep him with me, in order that</p>
<p>he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment </p>
<p>for the gospel, </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>but I wished to do nothing without your</p>
<p>consent in order that your goodness might not be by compul-</p>
<p>sion but of your own free decision. </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Perhaps for this reason</p>
<p>he was separated from you for a short time, so that you might </p>
<p>have him back forever, </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>no longer as a slave but more than</p>
<p>a slave, as a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much </p>
<p>more to you, both in the esh and in the Lord. </p>
<p>17</p>
<p>If, then, you</p>
<p>have partnership with me, receive him as you would receive </p>
<p>me. </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>If he has wronged you, or owes you anything, charge</p>
<p>that to me. </p>
<p>19</p>
<p>I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will</p>
<p>repay it—to say nothing of you owing me your very own self. </p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Yes, brother, I want some benet from you in the Lord.</p>
<p>Renew my heart in Messiah. </p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Condent of your obedience,</p>
<p>I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask. </p>
<p>22</p>
<p>At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am</p>
<p>hoping that through your prayers I will be graciously restored </p>
<p>to you.</p>
