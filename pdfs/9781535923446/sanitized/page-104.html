<p>Fusing the Horizons: Common Faith</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>message, the focus of our worship, detract from our mission, and even risk </p>
<p>shipwrecking our faith upon the jagged rocks of cultural conformity. Heretics </p>
<p>never claim to distort the biblical and ancient faith, but to make it more </p>
<p>palatable and pliable to the spirit of the age, and so remove barriers to belief. </p>
<p>For the second-century Gnostics this meant marrying Christianity to Platonic </p>
<p>cosmology, and for the old liberals of the early twentieth century it required </p>
<p>revising Christian doctrines in light of rationalistic critiques of revealed reli-</p>
<p>gion. We should embody the virtue of tolerance, especially in matters that are </p>
<p>adiaphora or “indifferent,” but at the same time we should think carefully of </p>
<p>what we tolerate and not allow anyone to bring sin or false teaching into the </p>
<p>church and expect it to be baptized and blessed in Jesus’s name.</p>
<p>We live in an age where, in some circles, inclusiveness has become the </p>
<p>new orthodoxy and exclusiveness is the only heresy. This is where Col 2:8–23 </p>
<p>is so important. It informs us that some things are not for negotiation, such </p>
<p>as the sufﬁciency and supremacy of Christ, and that nothing can supplement </p>
<p>God’s actions in his anointed Son. Colossians demands no compromise to the </p>
<p>creed of solus Christus or “Christ alone.” To capitulate this point will result </p>
<p>in a theology that is at ﬁrst imprecise, then wishy-washy, then populist, then </p>
<p>worldly, and ﬁnally trivial. Paul calls on Christian communities to confess their </p>
<p>faith with courage and ﬁdelity against the philosophies of this world, be they </p>
<p>within the church or external to it, and to singularly propound without reserva-</p>
<p>tion the absolute ﬁnality and ultimacy of Jesus Christ in all things. From this </p>
<p>faithful confession emerges a unity rooted in one faith, one Lord, and one </p>
<p>baptism; it unites believers from all over the world, it brings them together in </p>
<p>a common mission, it entreats them to recline at a common table, and forges </p>
<p>their shared identity as those who are in the Messiah.</p>
<p>Excursus: Colossians and the Roman Empire</p>
<p>In recent Pauline studies a growing number of researchers have been pay-</p>
<p>ing attention to the political background of Paul’s letters. This involves look-</p>
<p>ing at how a number of his favored terms like “gospel,” “Lord,” “Savior,” </p>
<p>“citizenship,” “parousia,” and “kingdom” are mirrored in the Roman socio-</p>
<p>political sphere. It is accompanied by examination of Roman propaganda and </p>
<p>the imperial cult of emperor worship as the foil for much of Paul’s theology. </p>
<p>Commentators then posit elements of counter-imperial theology in Paul’s let-</p>
