<p>Transformed and Renewed</p>

<p>renewal means that forgiveness is essential for the functioning of the new </p>
<p>humanity that the new Israel is called to be.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> e language of forgive-</p>
<p>ness is drawn from the world of human relationships: the journey from </p>
<p>anguish to restoration. Forgiveness does not mean that one ceases to feel </p>
<p>the hurt and pain associated with someone’s failing, but it means that one </p>
<p>forfeits their right to express their anger, to parade their hurt, and to de-</p>
<p>mand reparation. Forgiveness, as initiated by the wounded party, remains </p>
an expression of the divine character and becomes a trait that makes the
<p>new covenant community stand out among the cycle of resentment and </p>
<p>revenge that typies human relationships.</p>
<p>A formative conclusion to the moral discourse is contained in the </p>
<p>phrase, And to all these virtues add love, which is the bond of perfect </p>
<p>unity. e preeminence of love in the Christian ethic goes back to Jesus </p>
<p>in his combination of the Shema of Deut 6:4–5 with the love command </p>
<p>in Lev 19:18 (Matt 22:37–40/Mark 12:30–31/Luke 10:27). According to </p>
<p>Paul, love is the surest measure of authentic spirituality (1 Cor 13:1–13). </p>
<p>e only thing that counts is faith working through love (Gal 5:6). e </p>
<p>love command sums up the whole law (Rom 13:9–10; Gal 5:14). is ap-</p>
<p>peal to love is an important qualication to Paul’s rigorous defense of </p>
<p>believing integrity (doctrine) and his call for believing uprightness (eth-</p>
<p>ics). Paul is not imparting right doctrine for doctrine’s sake, nor is he </p>
<p>advocating righteous living for righteousness sake. Instead, he seeks to </p>
<p>warn them of the teachers, to conform them to the character of his gos-</p>
<p>pel, and to see them transformed by the power of the Spirit. He seeks to </p>
<p>preserve their integrity as Messiah-believing Gentiles and see them in </p>
<p>unity with other Gentile Christians, which could be jeopardized if the </p>
<p>philosophers win them over. In this sense, warning of potential intruders </p>
<p>and admonition against any behavioral lapses are the most loving things </p>
<p>one can sometimes do. Love seeks to protect the mind from corruption </p>
<p>and keep the soul from perversion by outside forces. Love wants the other </p>
<p>in the relationship to live to its fullest potential and to be true to its own </p>
<p>identity. Love means seeking to live in wholesome communion within a </p>
<p>family of faith, and that is why love is the bond of perfect unity.</p>
<p>Under a single connective (kai, “and”) Paul groups two further com-</p>
<p>mands for transformed behavior located around two genitival phrases, </p>
<p>the peace of Messiah and the word of Messiah. Following up the call for </p>
