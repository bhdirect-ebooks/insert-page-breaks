<p>Colossians 1:15–16</p>

<p>that rivals and exceeds thrones or lords or rulers or authorities.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>ese</p>
<p>most likely refer to hostile angelic powers associated with the bondage </p>
<p>of the present age that hold parts of the world in the sway of their dark </p>
<p>grip (see Rom 8:38; 1 Cor 8:5. Eph 1:21; 6:12).</p>

<p>Later Paul will say quite</p>
<p>dramatically that Jesus is their conqueror and champion (2:15).</p>
<p>The Body of the Universe and the Body of the Messiah </p>
<p>(1:17–18a)</p>
<p>e following verses inject, or perhaps even interrupt, the ow of the </p>
<p>poem with some brief remarks about Jesus’s priority to creation, his pres-</p>
<p>ervation of creation, and also of his authority over the church. Jesus is not </p>
<p>the rst of the created things but he is before all things, which lucidly </p>
<p>ascribes to him preexistence. In another striking christological remark, </p>
<p>Paul says that all things are sustained in him, which means that Christ </p>
<p>is the reason why there is a cosmos instead of chaos.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>is role is similar</p>
<p>to that of the Logos in Stoic philosophy where the Logos is the captain </p>
<p>or pilot of the universe. While the authority of Jesus is cosmic in scope, </p>
<p>it is no less ecclesial. Even as the cosmic lord, Jesus remains the head of </p>
<p>the body, the church. References to the church as the body are common </p>
<p>in Paul</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>and the metaphor was well known in antiquity and could even</p>
<p>be applied to the universe (e.g., Plato Tim. 28B).</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>Jesus is supreme over</p>
<p>both such bodies.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>As the “body of Messiah” the church is the physical</p>
<p>24. Arnold (1996: 254) points out that the archai (“rulers”) and exousiai (“authorities”) </p>
<p>are part of the Jewish vocabulary for angelic beings, but are not common in Hellenism </p>
<p>for gods, spirits, demons, or mediatory beings.</p>
<p>25. Cf. Gnilka 1980: 127; Arnold 1996: 253. Philo (Gig. 6), commenting on Gen 6:2, </p>
<p>says, “ose beings, whom other philosophers call demons, Moses usually calls angels; </p>
<p>and they are souls hovering in the air” (trans. Yonge).</p>
<p>26. Lightfoot 1879: 156.</p>
<p>27. Cf. 1 Cor 10:16–17; 12:12, 27; Rom 12:5; and more parallels in Eph 1:22–23; </p>
<p>4:15.</p>
<p>28. Cf. van Koonten 2003: 17–30, who supposes that a Stoic and Middle Platonist </p>
<p>conception of the universe as a body stands behind 1:17, 2:9–10, 17, 19. At this point, </p>
<p>the hymn is Stoic to the extent that it is concerned with the stability and coherence of the </p>
<p>universe in the sense of what holds it together (2003: 19–20). But this section lacks the </p>
view of the cosmos as animated by the divine world-soul; instead, it is controlled by the
<p>head who is clearly the Messiah (Bruce 1984b: 105).</p>
<p>29. e metaphor of “body” could also be applied to the Roman people (Livy Hist. </p>
<p>2.32.9–12; Epictetus Disc. 2.10.4–5). We have an implied contrast between two bodies: </p>
