<p>Fusing the Horizons: The Global Church</p>
<p>One of the many challenges that this text presents for the new covenant com-</p>
<p>munity is that it urges us to see ourselves as an international body of believers. </p>
<p>The gospel has come to us, just as it came to others elsewhere in the world. </p>
<p>The gospel is spreading and bearing fruit globally, just as it is among us. Thus, </p>
<p>we should see ourselves as a small part of the wider global church made up of </p>
<p>the multi-racial and multi-cultural people of God. This is all the more signiﬁ-</p>
<p>cant in the current global context where Christianity is declining (numerically </p>
<p>and spiritually) in Europe and North America, but rising in Africa, Asia, and </p>
<p>South America. Indeed, in some denominational contexts like Anglicanism, </p>
<p>it is leaders in Africa who are championing the cause of the gospel over and </p>
<p>against the liberalizing tendencies of the Western church. This global perspec-</p>
<p>tive on Christianity must surely shape our doctrine of the church, practice of </p>
<p>mission, and views of culture.</p>
<p>What begs for transformation in many cases is our ecclesiology. Why is </p>
the church so diverse, and is this a good thing? After all, diversity breeds dif-ference, debate, and even division. Would not a uniform, homogenous, almost
<p>clone-like church be better for unity? Yet the body of Christ has an indelible </p>
<p>and irreducible plurality built into it. The church is one body with many parts </p>
complete with a unity in diversity. Experiencing the power of forgiveness and
<p>being made part of the renewed Israel is a saving event that crosses racial, </p>
<p>geographical, and cultural boundaries. Christians have a shared identity in </p>
<p>Jesus Christ, they are part of a renewed Adamic race, they have accepted </p>
<p>the call to come into Abraham’s family of the faithful, they are forgiven of </p>
<p>their wicked and godless ways, and they seek to cultivate the virtues of faith, </p>
<p>hope, and love as well. That which unites them is inﬁnitely stronger than </p>
anything that might divide them from one another. For me this imagery of the
<p>multi-national church was powerfully revealed when I visited a church where </p>
<p>the minister arranged a video clip about all the people in his congregation of </p>
<p>different nationalities. Each congregant of foreign background spoke of what </p>
<p>faith in Christ meant for them given their background and heritage. It was </p>
<p>a medium sized rural church, but they still had more than sixteen different </p>
