<p>2. The Ethics of Paul’s Pastoral Rhetoric. On the rhetoric of Paul’s letter, </p>
<p>it cannot be denied that the epistle is largely emotive and even forceful as it </p>
<p>appears to us. This is not a letter from one equal to another, but a superior </p>
<p>to an inferior, a teacher to a student, or a mentor to a disciple. Paul gives </p>
<p>Philemon a command, but wants him to act out of love not compulsion (vv. </p>
<p>8–9, 14, 21). Paul alleges that Philemon is his debtor and presumes upon </p>
<p>his hospitality (vv. 19, 22). The conditional clause of v. 17, “If, then, you </p>
<p>have partnership with me, receive him as you would receive me,” assumes </p>
<p>that Philemon’s refusal would mean a rupture in fellowship with Paul. Paul’s </p>
<p>generosity in verse 18 about covering Onesimus’s debt surely presumes upon </p>
<p>Philemon’s refusal to seek compensation from Paul even as it is offered, and </p>
<p>that implies not seeking recompense from Onesimus either. Overall, Paul </p>
<p>plays on two motivating principles for persuasion: honor and advantage. Paul </p>
<p>anticipates and even celebrates Philemon’s compliance before it is promised </p>
<p>or even carried out. Thus, if Philemon refuses to acquiesce to Paul’s request </p>
<p>he then brings dishonor on himself and Paul—dishonor on himself for not </p>
<p>living up to the compliments, and on Paul for wrongly bestowing them in the </p>
<p>ﬁrst place. That response would render him thankless and Paul naïve. The </p>
<p>advantage that accrues to Philemon is that by obeying he gains Paul’s praise </p>
<p>and lives up to the accolades stated about him. We should add that this is a </p>
<p>private letter communicated before the entire church. Two prominent leaders </p>
<p>from Colossae, Archippus and Epaphras, are made aware of the letter, adding </p>
<p>further weight to Paul’s remarks since their opinion carries weight in the Lycus </p>
<p>Valley churches. Philemon’s response is eagerly awaited by the entire church </p>
<p>to see what he would do as the corporate honor of the assembly is at stake and </p>
<p>not merely Philemon’s own reputation.</p>
<p>Though this might seem manipulative and even unworthy of an apostle </p>
<p>and a Christian minister, I would point out that the contemporary rhetoric </p>
<p>of pastoral persuasion is not much different. Imagine a pastor thanking a </p>
<p>parishioner for “volunteering” to help out with the annual church picnic when </p>
<p>they have not already done so, or writing a group email to the youth leaders </p>
<p>conﬁdent that they will do the right thing when it comes to cleaning up the </p>
