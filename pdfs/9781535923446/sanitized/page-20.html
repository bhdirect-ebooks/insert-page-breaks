<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Apart from the fact of textual variations in the manuscript tradi-</p>
<p>tion itself, we have to admit that even the undisputed letters of Paul </p>
<p>may be the result of an amanuensis or secretary and are not neces-</p>
<p>sarily from Paul’s own hand. So comparing the style and language </p>
<p>of Romans and Colossians may not in actual fact be comparing an </p>
<p>authentic and pseudonymous piece of writing, but amount to com-</p>
<p>paring Tertius (Rom 16:22) and Timothy (Col 1:1) as Paul’s secre-</p>
<p>tary and coauthor in two dierent letters. We would do well also </p>
<p>to consider the observation of Matthew Brook O’Donnell about the </p>
<p>limits of statistical analysis:</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that by simply counting words it is possible </p>
<p>to dierentiate between authors. While a particular author may </p>
<p>have a core or base vocabulary, as well as an anity for certain </p>
<p>words (or combination/collocation of words), there are many fac-</p>
<p>tors, for instance, age, further education, social setting, rhetorical </p>
<p>purpose and so on, that restrict or expand this core set of lexi-</p>
<p>cal items. In spite of this, New Testament attribution studies and </p>
<p>many commentaries (sadly, some rather recent ones at that) have </p>
<p>placed considerable weight on counting the number of words </p>
<p>found in one letter but not found in a group of letters assumed </p>
<p>to be authentic.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>(2) It should be noted that a signicant number of hapax also occur </p>
<p>in Galatians, Philippians, and even Philemon. As for absences of </p>
<p>key terminology, the term “justify” does not appear at all in First </p>
<p>essalonians or Philippians, while “law” is absent from Second </p>
<p>Corinthians, and even “salvation” does not appear in Galatians or </p>
<p>First Corinthians.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>In addition, there are some genuine stylistic and</p>
<p>grammatical anities with Paul’s other letters in Colossians which </p>
<p>are evident in the opening greeting, thanksgiving section, epistle </p>
<p>closing, plus the presence of typical Pauline expressions throughout </p>
<p>Colossians (e.g., “in Messiah”). We also nd conceptual similarities </p>
<p>in terms of letter structure and theological content (e.g., freedom </p>
<p>from Jewish practices).</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>(3) ere are cogent reasons why the language of Colossians is dierent </p>
<p>to the other Pauline letters, such as the fact that Paul seems to be cit-</p>
