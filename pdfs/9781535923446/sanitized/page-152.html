<p>Philemon 8–22</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>e body of the letter is contained in vv. 8–22 where Paul makes his </p>
<p>plea for Onesimus by acting as an intermediary. Paul describes his own </p>
<p>situation as a prisoner and elderly man and recaps his relationship to </p>
<p>Onesimus, including Onesimus’s conversion, which must now be factored </p>
<p>into Philemon’s response. ere is a deliberate play on Onesimus’s name </p>
<p>as “useful”; Paul hints at his desire to have Onesimus returned to him </p>
<p>as an assistant. e intercession includes Paul’s willingness to cover any </p>
<p>debts incurred by Onesimus’s error and he reminds Philemon of his own </p>
<p>indebtedness to Paul. Philemon’s debt would be covered with Philemon’s </p>
<p>obedience to Paul’s request.</p>
<p>e transition to the letter body is marked by therefore, which seeks </p>
<p>to apply Paul’s thanksgiving and prayerful activity to the matter at hand. </p>
<p>While Paul is bold enough in Messiah to command Philemon to respond </p>
<p>positively to his request, he is reluctant to do so. Paul was a gure of au-</p>
<p>dacity, bravado, chutzpah, and no holds barred arguing. When combined </p>
<p>with his apostolic credentials, Paul might well order Philemon to submit </p>
<p>to his authority. Yet what Paul wants is for Philemon to do what is t-</p>
<p>ting or morally appropriate to the concern that he is about to raise. e </p>
<p>response should be tting to Philemon as both a slave owner and as a </p>
<p>Christian, which would be the opposite of acting out of spite, anger, or as </p>
<p>a grieved slave owner. Paul does not issue a command, but rather prefers </p>
<p>to make an appeal on the basis of love. Paul willingly forfeits the demand </p>
<p>of obedience that his apostolic authority could rightly claim and instead </p>
<p>appeals to Philemon’s sense of goodness and kind aection.</p>
<p>Paul appeals in person as an old man and a prisoner of Messiah </p>
<p>Jesus, which evidently is meant to tug on the heart strings at least a little </p>
<p>since it highlights his vulnerability and the cost of the service borne by </p>
<p>him. He then gets to the substance of his appeal for my child, Onesimus, </p>
<p>whom I gave birth to during imprisonment. Some time during Paul’s </p>
<p>imprisonment (how and why we don’t know for sure) Onesimus came </p>
<p>into Paul’s company and was converted to faith in Jesus. Paul could of-</p>
<p>ten refer to himself as a father to his children (1 Cor 4:14–17) and the </p>
<p>maternal language of giving birth to a child is not in anyway foreign to </p>
<p>Paul either (Gal 4.19). e image here could be paternal (e.g., “whose </p>
<p>father I became” [esv]; cf. nrsv, net, njb),</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>but I prefer a maternal image</p>
<p>of “giving birth” because (1) in the New Testament gennaō has the most </p>
<p>1. Cf. Petersen 1985: 128.</p>
