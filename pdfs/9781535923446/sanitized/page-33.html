<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>syncretism and acculturation. Colossians exhibits the telltale signs of a set </p>
<p>of Jewish teachings expressed in the idiom and categories of Hellenism. </p>
<p>Yet Hellenism itself can either atten out or reinforce Jewish distinctives </p>
<p>as exposure to a secondary culture forces one to either absorb or deect </p>
<p>external inuences.</p>
<p>ird, the philosophy is conceivably a form of Judaism that is be-</p>
<p>ing commended to the Colossians. Judaism could also be described as </p>
<p>a philosophy in apologetic literature.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>Josephus describes the various</p>
<p>Jewish sects as philosophies</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>and he can even refer to the Jewish religion</p>
<p>as a form of national philosophy.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>Philo represents Judaism as achieving</p>
<p>the highest ideals of Hellenistic philosophy.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>What also indicates Jewish</p>
<p>adversaries is the injunction in 2:16–17, where the triadic formula of </p>
<p>festivals, new moons, and Sabbaths occurs in the Septuagint and repre-</p>
<p>sents the commandments of the Torah (law of Moses). e references to </p>
<p>circumcision (2:11, 3:11, and 4:11) imply that while circumcision itself </p>
<p>was probably not the presenting issue, nonetheless, it was crucial in iden-</p>
<p>tifying Paul’s opponents. What is more, there are a number of similarities </p>
<p>between the teachers in Colossae and the proselytizers in Galatia and </p>
<p>how both are engaged by Paul. e philosophy is touted as an oppressive </p>
<p>spiritual force in much the same way that Paul likens the law in Galatians </p>
<p>to hostile spiritual powers (Col 2:8, 14–15; Gal 4:9–11). In Colossians, as </p>
<p>in Galatians, the erroneous beliefs required Paul to shore up the integrity </p>
<p>of Gentile Christian identity without the need to take on law observance </p>
<p>(Col 3:11; Gal 3:28). In Colossians as in Galatians, Paul exhorts that one </p>
<p>does not require Torah to facilitate righteous living (Col 2:23–3:17; Gal </p>
<p>5:13–15). In Colossians as in Galatians, freedom from the designs of the </p>
<p>Colossian philosophers and from the Galatian proselytizers is indebted </p>
<p>to dying with Messiah and being baptized into Messiah (Col 2:12; 3:3; </p>
<p>Gal 3:26–27). Colossians and Galatians both refer to the freedom of the </p>
<p>Christian from circumcision and festivals (Col 2:11–12, 16; Gal 5:2; 6:12–</p>
<p>15; 4:10) and refer to deliverance from evil powers (Col 1:13–14; Gal 1:4). </p>
<p>In light of this, it seems that Paul is evidently negating the value of Jewish </p>
<p>boundary markers and lessening the social and religious function of the </p>
