<p>Preface</p>
<p>Commentary writing is, so I have learned, no simple feat. ere is the </p>
<p>mammoth task of doing your own translation, an immense volume </p>
<p>of primary and secondary literature to read and interact with, and the </p>
<p>struggle of trying to nd something new or incredibly profound to say </p>
<p>in every single verse when you nd yourself most of the time agreeing </p>
<p>with those who ploughed the textual terrain before you. I’m reminded of </p>
<p>Calvin’s words in the preface to his Romans commentary where he virtu-</p>
<p>ally apologizes for writing another commentary on Paul’s letter despite so </p>
<p>many ne volumes already existing: </p>
<p>Since so many scholars of pre-eminent learning have previously </p>
<p>devoted their eorts to explaining this Epistle, it seems unlikely </p>
<p>that there is any room le for others to produce something better </p>
<p>. . . It will, however, I hope be admitted that nothing has ever been </p>
<p>so perfectly done by men that there is no room le for those who </p>
<p>follow them to rene, adorn, or illustrate their work. I do not dare </p>
<p>to say anything of myself, except that I thought that the present </p>
<p>work would be of some prot, and that I have been led to under-</p>
<p>take it for no other reason than the common good of the Church.</p>
<p>All I can say is that I have labored here as best as I can and I hope that </p>
<p>the fruit of this work is fresh, stimulating, and challenging for those who </p>
<p>belong to the new covenant communities of the twenty-rst century. As </p>
<p>it is, much of the content was formed through the regular delivery of ser-</p>
<p>mons and in the context of worship at the Highland eological College </p>
<p>student chapel, where we all learned that Colossians speaks much to our </p>
<p>contemporary age.</p>
<p>Colossians is my favorite book of the Pauline corpus and Philemon </p>
<p>is a much underappreciated child of the canonical family. What links both </p>
<p>books together I believe is the New Testament message of reconciliation. </p>
<p>Christ is able to reconcile us to God the Father (Colossians) and he gives </p>
<p>us the grace to be reconciled to each other (Philemon). ey contain a </p>
<p>message that our much hurting world is in desperate need of hearing. I </p>
<p>have tried to avoid writing a commentary on other commentaries. For the </p>
