<p>Transformed and Renewed</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>He writes that in this renewal there is no longer Greek and Jew, circum-</p>
<p>cised and uncircumcised, Barbarian, Scythian, slave and free. Similar to </p>
<p>Gal 3:28, Paul is advocating a negation of ethnic and economic realities, </p>
<p>in terms of their claims to separation and superiority, by the new cre-</p>
<p>ation.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>It is not that these distinctions cease to exist in some way, but</p>
<p>they are now transcended by virtue of the believer’s participation in the </p>
<p>Messiah. It seems to me that the emphasis in Gal 3:28–29 and Col 3:11 </p>
<p>is not the obliteration of dierent human identities, but the inclusion of </p>
<p>multiple identities under a single meta-identity (“in Messiah,” en Christō). </p>
<p>But that can only be true if the existing identities, which are a means of </p>
<p>distinction and status, are themselves negated in value and lessened in </p>
<p>their ability to cause dierentiation. e old self is thereby transformed </p>
<p>and subsumed beneath a shared meta-identity that can sustain an array </p>
of diverse entities within it. So I am a male, but an in-Messiah male; I am
<p>a Gentile, but an in-Messiah Gentile. e distinctions of Greek and Jew, </p>
<p>or Australian and New Zealander, are enveloped by and subordinated to </p>
<p>being en Christō.</p>
<p>e subversive nature of Paul’s ethics strikes against the jugular of </p>
<p>Greco-Roman social stratication with its various tiers of power and </p>
<p>privilege. Paul also redenes the boundaries of election in light of the ad-</p>
<p>vent of the Messiah. Both the Hellenistic and Jewish spheres knew supe-</p>
<p>riority based on gender, race, and culture. ales is reported to have given </p>
<p>thanks to Fortune that he was born a human being and not a brute, a man </p>
<p>and not a woman, a Greek and not a Barbarian.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> Some of the rabbis prac-</p>
<p>ticed a prayer attributed to Rabbi Judah ben El’ai, which said, “Blessed are </p>
<p>thou who did not make me Gentile, blessed art thou who did not make </p>
<p>me a woman, blessed art thou who did not make me a brute.”</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>But no</p>
<p>Christian could give thanks for this, nor could they pray this rabbinic </p>
<p>prayer. Salvation in Christ completely eliminates any such boasting (see </p>
<p>1 Cor 1:26–31). In the words of the second century Christian apologist </p>
<p>Aristides, Christians are a “ird Race,” alongside Greeks and Jews (Apol. </p>
<p>2).</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> Paul’s statement implies a breaking down of the covenant boundar-</p>
<p>ies separating Jew and non-Jew, and, in a sense, expands the currency of </p>
<p>27. Cf. 1 Cor 7:18–19; 12:13; Gal 5:6; 6:15.</p>
<p>28. Diogenes Laertius Lives of the Philosophers 1:33.</p>
<p>29. t. Ber. 7:18; y. Ber. 9:2, 13d; b. Menah. 43b.</p>
<p>30. Some manuscripts of Aristides read, “fourth race” and include the designants: </p>
<p>Barbarians and Greeks, Jews and Christians.</p>
