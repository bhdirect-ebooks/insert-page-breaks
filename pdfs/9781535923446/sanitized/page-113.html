<p>of their old identities through the cross. e aorist verb apethanete (you </p>
<p>died) points back to baptism-confession as the moment of identifying </p>
<p>with Christ’s death and resurrection. e life that is hidden with Messiah </p>
<p>in God stands for the structure of their existence. It is a life that is lived out </p>
<p>in the world through an exterior resource (Rom 6:4; 2 Cor 4:10–11; 13:4). </p>
<p>Such a life has its center with Christ in God (Phil 1:21). It is lived for God </p>
<p>and his Messiah (Rom 6:10–11; 14:8; 2 Cor 5:15) and continues on un-</p>
<p>der the aegis of the faithfulness of the Son of God (Gal 2:19–20).</p>

<p>Pau l’s</p>
<p>apocalyptic orientation shines through in v. 4 as he tells the Colossians </p>
<p>that when Messiah is manifested then they will be manifested with him </p>
<p>in glory. is is the only point in Colossians where Paul alludes to Christ’s </p>
<p>parousia or second advent. e manifestation or revealing of Christ at the </p>
<p>parousia will disclose the reality of these believers. It will show that they </p>
<p>are “of Messiah” and it will also evince the true character of their lives </p>
<p>as being soaked in and pervaded by Jesus Christ’s own life. e glory in </p>
<p>particular may be associated with the resurrection of believers (see 1 Cor </p>
<p>15:42–43; Phil 3:20–21; 2 ess 2:14). e believer’s life in Christ then can </p>
<p>be sketched in three stages: (1) they have died and risen with Jesus, (2) </p>
<p>their present life is hidden with Messiah, and (3) at his coming they will </p>
<p>be revealed in glory.</p>

<p>When once asked if he was “saved,” B. F. Westcott</p>
<p>replied: “I am saved, I am being saved, I will be saved” (see 2 Cor 1:9–10). </p>
<p>By identifying with Messiah in heaven, the Colossians participate in the </p>
<p>fruits of salvation and also anticipate the consummation of that salvation </p>
<p>at the revelation of the Messiah.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Living as the New Humanity of the New Age (3:5–11)</p>
<p>e inference that Paul draws (erefore) in v. 5 is that if they have </p>
<p>died with Messiah then they must enact this death and put to death the </p>
<p>members of your earthly being. at carries the sense of killing, mur-</p>
<p>dering, or destroying the earthly nature which stands as the antithesis </p>
<p>to the Christ-saturated life which they now partake of (see Rom 6:11; </p>
<p>8:13). One is either dead in sin (Col 2:13) or dead to sin (Col 3:5).</p>
