<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>the worship of the angels that they have seen upon entrance into the </p>
<p>heavenly realm and subsequently venerating the angels that accompanied </p>
<p>them in their tour of the heavenly court. A plausible scenario, then, is </p>
<p>that the teachers advocated the necessity of ascetic practices leading to </p>
<p>visionary experiences resulting in one sharing in the angelic liturgies </p>
<p>of heaven, submitting to angelic “rulers and authorities,” who exercised </p>
<p>some form of power over them through law observance, and translating </p>
<p>all of this into their every day pattern of life (2:8–10, 16–23). e role </p>
<p>of angels in the Colossian philosophy may not be clear-cut since their </p>
<p>roles in veneration, mediation, or domination could overlap. What seems </p>
<p>likely is that the Colossian philosophy represents a combination of the </p>
<p>ascetic-mystical piety of Jewish apocalypticism with its emphasis on vi-</p>
<p>sionary experiences of heavenly ascents (an incipient form of merkabah </p>
<p>mysticism), the dualism of Hellenistic cosmology and anthropology, and </p>
<p>perhaps the veneration of angels inuenced by local pagan folk religions </p>
<p>involving appeal to angels through magic; all of these are possibilities for </p>
<p>comprising elements of the philosophy.</p>
<p>Another element of the Colossian philosophy that I wish to advo-</p>
<p>cate is its tacit missionary function. One or more persons from Colossae </p>
<p>or the Lycus Valley is commending Judaism to the Gentile Christians in </p>
<p>Colossae by using the religious ritual of ascetic-mystic Judaism and the </p>
<p>language of Hellenistic philosophy (most likely Stoicism of some form) </p>
<p>as a means of attracting them to it. Harald Hegermann argues that the </p>
<p>Colossians were being exposed to Jewish missionary propaganda,</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>while I reject the idea of widespread Jewish missionary activity, nonethe-</p>
<p>less, I think here it has something going for it. Jewish communities did </p>
<p>attract proselytes and many Jews wrote philosophical defenses of their </p>
<p>tiation rites and its presence in Colossians means that some of the Gentile converts were </p>
<p>previously involved in the mystery cults. is is based largely on an inscription from the </p>
<p>Apollos temple at Claros 30 km north of Ephesus, which uses the word embateuō three </p>
<p>times (Dibelius 1975; Arnold 1996: 104–57). e problem is that in the various witnesses </p>
<p>to the mystery rites embateuō is never used alone and always includes the words muēsis </p>
<p>or epopteia for expressing the reception of the mysteries. is combination of words is </p>
<p>entirely lacking from Col 2:18–23, which evacuates the argument for a “technical” usage </p>
<p>of embateuō. A far better background for embateuō is Jewish mystical ascents to heaven </p>
<p>for worship with the angels (Sappington 1991: 156–68; Rowland 1983: 76; Evans 1982: </p>
<p>198).</p>
