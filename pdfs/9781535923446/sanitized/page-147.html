<p>Letter Opening, greeting, </p>
<p>and thanksgiving (1–7)</p>
<p>Paul, a prisoner for Messiah Jesus, and Timothy our brother. </p>
<p>To Philemon our beloved fellow worker </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>and Apphia our</p>
<p>sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in </p>
<p>your house. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Grace to you and peace from God our Father</p>
<p>and the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>I thank my God always when</p>
<p>I remember you in my prayers, </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>hearing of your love and</p>
<p>faithfulness which you have toward the Lord Jesus and to all </p>
<p>the saints, </p>
<p>6</p>
<p> in order that the sharing of your faith may be-</p>
<p>come eective in the full knowledge of every good thing that </p>
<p>is in us for the sake of Messiah. </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>For I have taken much joy</p>
<p>and comfort from your love, because the hearts of the saints </p>
<p>have been refreshed through you brother.</p>
<p>e letter to Philemon is a mere 335 words, yet it raises crucial issues </p>
<p>about slavery and the ethics of pastoral persuasion. It is the nal letter in </p>
<p>the Pauline corpus and among the most personal and pastoral in the New </p>
<p>Testament canon. e letter is addressed primarily to Philemon but also </p>
<p>includes Apphia, Archippus, and the church in his house. is means that </p>
<p>we have a private letter that is placed into a wider congregational setting </p>
<p>as the context in which the drama of Onesimus’s ight and the eective-</p>
<p>ness of Paul’s mediation is played out. A household matter is put before a </p>
<p>household church. Moreover, it is a letter that draws us into the narrative </p>
<p>and social world of the apostle and the associated challenges that Paul </p>
<p>faced as a missionary pastor.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Notably, in the letter opening, Paul oers</p>
<p>thanksgiving praises to Philemon for the very virtues that he hopes he </p>
<p>will express in resolving the matter concerning Onesimus.</p>
