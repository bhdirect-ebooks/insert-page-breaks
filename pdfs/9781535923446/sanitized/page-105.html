<p>Excursus: Colossians and the Roman Empire</p>

<p>ters, which amount to a veiled protest against the social order, military power, </p>
<p>and political tyranny of the Roman Empire. This has even been dubbed the </p>
<p>“Fresh Perspective on Paul” by N. T. Wright.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>We should be cautious of</p>
<p>this approach in so far that it can seem a little too congenial to fashionable </p>
<p>anti-Americanism (where America is the new “Rome”). It potentially mis-</p>
<p>takes context for content, and this perspective often does some scandalously </p>
<p>creative exegesis of Rom 13:1–8 where Paul urges believers to submit to </p>
<p>state authorities. Paul was not a white, suburban, middle-class, liberal arts </p>
<p>teacher, educated in the 1960s, and neither does every reference to Jesus as </p>
<p>Kurios (“Lord”) automatically demand the antiphon, “and Caesar is not.”</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yet there can be no denying the theopolitical dimension to Paul’s theology and </p>
<p>the counter-imperial implications of much of his thought.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>If, as tradition</p>
<p>tells us, Paul was executed in Rome, it was not because he practiced some </p>
<p>kind of interiorized spirituality to the effect that “Jesus is Lord of my heart,” </p>
<p>but something of his message and conduct brought him to the attention of </p>
<p>the imperial authorities and warranted capital punishment in their eyes. We </p>
<p>should also remember that opposition to the politics and pantheon of the </p>
<p>pagan nations was at the very root of Israel’s exclusive devotion to Yahweh, as </p>
<p>the nations would one day be in submission to the God of Israel, the God of </p>
<p>the Jews. This is why Jews, generally speaking, sought exemption from service </p>
<p>in the Roman army and why some zealous-minded Galileans had as their </p>
<p>motto “no king but God.”</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>Judea was the only nation that refused to engage</p>
<p>in a god swap with Rome, whereby both groups added the other’s gods to their </p>
<p>pantheon of deities and prescribed rituals that paid homage to both groups </p>
<p>of gods. The angry mob who dragged Paul’s friends before the city authorities </p>
<p>in Thessalonica understood the potentially subversive nature of this Jesus </p>
<p>movement when they said of Christians, “These men who have caused trouble </p>
<p>all over the world have now come here, and Jason has welcomed them into his </p>
<p>house. They are all defying Caesar’s decrees, saying that there is another king, </p>
<p>one called Jesus” (Acts 17:6–7 t n i v ). The ﬁrst Christians were not political </p>
<p>activists, but neither did they possess a spirituality detached from political </p>
<p>realities, for the ﬁnal consummation of the kingdom of God would spell the </p>
<p>end of all human domains of authority opposed to God’s reign on earth.</p>
