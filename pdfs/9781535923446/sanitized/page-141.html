<p>Closing Words of Exhortation from a Missionary Friend</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>Finally, the letter closes with Paul’s autograph. He urges them to </p>
<p>remember his chains as a vivid image of the physical nature of his im-</p>
<p>prisonment. e chains are themselves further proof that Paul really is a </p>
<p>“servant” of the gospel (1:23, 25) and is “lling up what is lacking in the </p>
<p>aictions of the Messiah” (1:24). e apostle then closes with the bene-</p>
<p>diction the grace be with you, a tting close to a letter that commends the </p>
<p>“grace of God in all its truth” (1:6).</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Christian Leaders</p>
<p>In light of Col 4:2–17, how is the pastor, elder, Sunday school teacher, youth </p>
<p>worker, and Bible study leader to serve their congregations? Christian leaders </p>
<p>can take a lot away from this. </p>
<p>1. Prayer and Word. Central to any Christian ministry must be the disci-</p>
<p>pline of prayer and instruction in the Word. This was very much central in the </p>
<p>ministry of the apostles in the early Jerusalem church (Acts 6:4), and a similar </p>
<p>pattern is found in Col 4:2–3. Ministers of the new covenant are to boldly </p>
<p>declare the word of God to those both outside and within the church. They </p>
<p>are also to “struggle” in prayer for others. How many Sunday School teach-</p>
<p>ers, hospital chaplains, pastors, Christian professors, or leaders in campus </p>
<p>ministries can honestly say that they struggle in prayer for those entrusted to </p>
<p>their instruction and spiritual care? One of my seminary professors told me a </p>
<p>story about how he was at an all-day conference for Christian ministers from </p>
<p>various denominations in a small country town. Every couple of hours the local </p>
<p>priest, who was hosting the event, would rise from the table, ring a large bell </p>
<p>in the church tower and return to the meeting about ten minutes later. When </p>
<p>asked why he did that (especially as it was so annoying and disruptive for the </p>
<p>meeting) he replied that every few hours during the day he would pray for at </p>
<p>least ten minutes for the people in the local township, and ringing the bell was </p>
<p>how he let them know that their priest was now praying for them. We do not </p>
<p>have to ring bells or bang gongs, but we need to let the ﬂock under our care </p>
<p>know that we are faithfully praying for them. They will be genuinely consoled </p>
<p>and encouraged to know that their youth pastor, Christian friend, chaplain, </p>
<p>professor, deacon, or parish priest is wrestling for them with prayers and peti-</p>
<p>tions before the throne of God.</p>
