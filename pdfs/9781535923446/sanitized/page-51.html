<p>anksgiving and Intercession</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>gospel to the Colossian assembly, their spiritual nourishment, the trans-</p>
<p>formation of their minds, and the worthiness of their behavior before the </p>
<p>Lord.</p>
<p>Hellenistic letters oen began with a note of thanksgiving to the </p>
<p>gods for certain persons or events. e inclusion of a thanksgiving sec-</p>
<p>tion in personal communication carried over into Hellenistic Judaism, as </p>
<p>evidenced by 2 Macc 1:10–13 where a letter from the Jews of Jerusalem to </p>
<p>Jews in Egypt includes thanking God for his deliverance from a perilous </p>
<p>military threat. While the form is clearly indebted to Hellenistic letter </p>
<p>writing conventions, the content is very much of a Jewish and Christian </p>
<p>character. anks is given to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, </p>
<p>which is indicative of the binitarian devotional life of the rst Christians </p>
<p>focused on Father and Son.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Jewish “monotheism” is assumed here, but</p>
<p>it is redrawn in light of belief in the life, death, resurrection, exaltation, </p>
<p>and co-enthronement of Jesus who is both Lord and Messiah (see Acts </p>
<p>2:36).</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>e thanksgiving prayer is of a piece with the other Pauline thanks-</p>
<p>giving petitions (Rom 1:8; 1 Cor 1:4–9; Phil 1:3–11; 1 ess 1:2–4; 2 ess </p>
<p>1:3; Phlm 4–7; 2 Tim 1:3–7). is one is certainly longer than normal </p>
<p>and it is rivaled in length and poetic poignancy only by Eph 1:1–14. e </p>
<p>prayer is to some degree a general plea for the Colossians’ spiritual well-</p>
<p>being, but specic elements do occur in the prayer as well. ese ele-</p>
<p>ments are most apparent at the mention of Epaphras whose authority and </p>
<p>inuence in Colossae perhaps now hangs in the balance. e emphasis </p>
<p>on knowledge and insight in the prayer are a direct counterclaim to the </p>
<p>Colossian philosophy. e identication of the saints in the light as an-</p>
<p>gels can be related to surfacing issues of angelic worship and deliverance </p>
<p>from malevolent spiritual powers. ese are matters that Paul will pick </p>
<p>up again in the letter. e apostle signals early on, in the language of wor-</p>
<p>ship and adoration, that the Colossians already have everything that the </p>
<p>local teachers are promising them, and they have it in the gospel of the </p>
<p>Messiah.</p>
