<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>

<p>faith for largely Jewish audiences but potentially for Gentile readers as </p>
<p>well. Many Gentiles did convert to Judaism and in numbers high enough </p>
<p>to alarm the cultural elites.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>Gentile adherents to Jewish ways, sometimes</p>
<p>known as God-fearers, do not seem to have been an infrequent occurrence </p>
<p>either.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>James Dunn argues that the Colossian philosophy represents the</p>
<p>apologia (philosophical defense) of a local synagogue responding to the </p>
<p>rise of a form of messianic Judaism in their immediate circle.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>If the best</p>
<p>type of defense is oense, then perhaps a circle of Jewish teachers from a </p>
<p>local synagogue immersed in Jewish mystical traditions and Hellenistic </p>
<p>thought have come into contact with Christians in Colossae and are com-</p>
<p>mending this form of “Judaism” to them. eir criticism of Christianity </p>
<p>and Jesus Christ may even be benign in down playing rather than denying </p>
<p>him a heavenly role. ey condemn those who do not keep the regula-</p>
<p>tions of Torah, they claim a share in the inheritance of Israel, and insist </p>
<p>that the Colossian Christians undertake the ascetic rigor required for </p>
<p>heavenly visions.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>is scenario provides an appropriate background to</p>
<p>the Colossian philosophy and explains the socio-rhetorical dynamics of </p>
<p>the letter. is accounts for the Jewish character of the philosophy as well </p>
<p>as the Hellenistic terminology in which it is expressed. e philosophy, as </p>
<p>it is written about in the letter to the Colossians, arguably represents an </p>
attempt by one or more Jewish individuals to recruit Christian Gentiles
<p>to a form of Jewish belief and practice through a highly contextualized </p>
<p>missionary approach. e absence of a concerted polemic against cir-</p>
<p>cumcision (though perhaps implied in 2:11; 3:11; and 4:11) by Paul may </p>
<p>be said to count against that hypothesis. But I suggest that the polemical </p>
<p>references to circumcision, spiritual or physical, could hardly be heard </p>
<p>as any other than an intra-Jewish debate stemming from factional rival-</p>
<p>ries over the nature and boundaries of Jewish identity. What is more, not </p>
<p>all forms of Jewish missionary activity were necessarily said to be aer </p>
<p>“full” converts. Some Jewish perspectives on conversion did not require </p>
<p>circumcision (see especially Josephus Ant. 20.41 and Philo QE 2.2) and </p>
<p>only sought partial adherents and philosophical respect for its beliefs and </p>
<p>practices in a wider intellectual forum. Whereas Lohse argues that the </p>
