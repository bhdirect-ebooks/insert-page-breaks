<p>nations represented in their parish. The climax of the event was when they </p>
<p>brought out the sixteen ﬂags of each nation represented in the congregation. </p>
<p>No ﬂag was raised above the others, no ﬂags were bowed before another one, </p>
<p>but at the end of the service all the ﬂags were laid at the foot of a cross.</p>
In addition, an ethnically diverse church has some key advantages for
<p>missions. I have been made aware of how Christians from Latin America have </p>
<p>been successfully reaching out to Muslims in Europe. The advantage that </p>
<p>Latin Americans have is that their skin colour is similar to Arabs and Asians, </p>
<p>they are Christian but not white Anglo-Saxons, there is no history of conﬂict </p>
<p>between the Middle East and South America, both groups hail from develop-</p>
<p>ing countries with generally strong family units and relatively conservative </p>
<p>moral values, and both groups are resident aliens in the new Europe. It is </p>
<p>precisely the culture and nationality of these Latin American missionaries </p>
<p>that makes them far more able to reach out to Muslims in Europe where </p>
many simply cannot penetrate effectively. By divine providence, then, there is a great diversity to the body of Christ that enables the mission of God to be accomplished through the culturally diverse, multi-ethnic, and global church
<p>of Jesus Christ.</p>
