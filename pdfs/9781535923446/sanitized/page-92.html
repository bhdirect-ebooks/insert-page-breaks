<p>Colossians 2:8–15</p>

<p>sovereign and supreme over the very “powers” that the Colossians think </p>
<p>that they could appease through partial Torah observance.</p>
<p>e meaning and signicance of being in him is further unpacked </p>
<p>through a number of metaphors that emphasize their incorporation into </p>
<p>the Messiah.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Starting with a cultic metaphor, it means that one has</p>
<p>been circumcised with a circumcision done without human hands. e </p>
<p>mention of circumcision would bring to mind a number of things to any </p>
<p>reader familiar with Israel’s sacred traditions. Circumcision of male babies </p>
<p>on the eighth day was the seal of God’s covenant with Abraham, the sign </p>
<p>of membership in the Mosaic covenant, and a catchword for the Jewish </p>
<p>people. e Old Testament scriptures also know of a “spiritual” circumci-</p>
<p>sion (Deut 10:16; 30:6; Jer 4:4; Ezek 44:7) and such a thought lies in the </p>
<p>background here. It is applied by Paul to those who are physically uncir-</p>
<p>cumcised themselves, but have been ingraed into the commonwealth </p>
<p>of Israel through the Messiah of Israel (see Rom 2:28–29; 2 Cor 3:3; Phil </p>
<p>3:3; Gos. om. 53; Odes Sol. 11:2). A circumcision done without human </p>
<p>hands most likely refers to the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit in the </p>
<p>believer.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>ings made with human hands, in Jewish tradition, were the</p>
<p>manufacturing of idols and pagan temples (Lev 26:1; Isa 45:16).</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>While</p>
<p>it is possible to nd here a critique of circumcision being forced upon </p>
<p>Gentiles, it is by no means certain that the teachers were urging circum-</p>
<p>cision.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Given that circumcision is used rhetorically rather than singled</p>
<p>out specically in relation to the philosophy, the teachers were most likely </p>
<p>aer adherents rather than full converts. More to the point, this messianic </p>
work of circumcision signies an act of renewal and appears to be divided
<p>into two parts. On the one side, there is putting o the body of esh, </p>
<p>which is tantamount to turning from paganism and idolatry towards the </p>
<p>living God (see 1 ess 1:9). On the other side, there is also the circumci-</p>
<p>sion of the Messiah, which most likely pertains to the circumcision done </p>
<p>by the Messiah and which characterizes those who belong to the Messiah, </p>
<p>that is to say, a messianic circumcision of the heart that brings new life.</p>
