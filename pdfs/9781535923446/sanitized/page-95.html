<p>Engaging the Empty Deceit of Mystic Judaism</p>
<p>81</p>
a rst-century Jew speak of the divinely given law in such terms? Paul and
<p>the law is one of the most complex and dicult subjects of Pauline theol-</p>
<p>ogy and the history of early Christianity. For Paul, the Torah is part of the </p>
<p>tripartite structure of law-sin-death (1 Cor 15:56), which, in the saga of </p>
<p>redemptive history, makes the law a hostile power exerting a deadly force </p>
<p>upon human beings. is is why Paul can associate the Torah with wrath </p>
<p>(Rom 4:15), sin (Rom 5:20), slavery (Rom 7:6, 25; Gal 4:1–7; 5:1), death </p>
<p>(2 Cor 3:6–7), curses (Gal 3:10), imprisonment (Rom 7:6; Gal 3:22–23), a </p>
<p>temporary but harsh guardianship (Gal 3:24), and even depict it as hostile </p>
<p>spiritual power (Gal 4:8–10). at is not to say that Torah is intrinsically </p>
<p>evil; to the contrary, Paul regards it as good, just, and holy (Rom 7:12). </p>
<p>e Torah became an instrument of death only through sin and it was </p>
<p>designed to be in eect only until the coming of the Messiah. In the hands </p>
<p>of certain “powers” the law becomes a tool of oppression and captivity. It </p>
<p>is from the “sting,” “curse,” and “condemnation” of this manuscript that </p>
<p>believers are delivered.</p>
<p>Paul’s statements about freedom and liberation from the law else-</p>
<p>where stand in analogy to his claim that Jesus took it from our midst, </p>
<p>rather like taking a gun or knife out of the hand of an assailant. rough </p>
<p>the metaphor of a triumph, that is, a formal procession celebrating a mili-</p>
<p>tary victory, Paul reverses the image of the cross as an emblem of shame </p>
<p>and defeat and transforms it into one of honor and victory (see 2 Cor </p>
<p>2:14). e angelic powers that seek to use the Torah to subjugate the be-</p>
<p>lievers nd the weapon snatched from their grasp and nailed to the cross. </p>
<p>e penalty and curse of the Torah is undone as its punitive eects are ab-</p>
<p>sorbed in the esh of the Son of God (see Rom 8:3; Gal 3:13). Without the </p>
<p>power of sin and law, the powers are now disarmed</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>as their single arrow</p>
<p>to threaten and kill has been broken in the body of the Messiah. us, he </p>
<p>renders them impotent and victimless as their power is spent and broken. </p>
<p>embodied or religious duties dened.”</p>
<p>24. I demur from the view of some (e.g., Lightfoot 1879: 190; Moule 1957: 101; McL. </p>
Wilson 2005: 211–12) that Christ stripped or divested himself of something like his esh
<p>or the powers as if they were a form of clothing (cf. the Gnostic Gospel of Truth: “Having </p>
<p>stripped himself of the perishable rags, he put on imperishability . . . he passed through </p>
<p>those who were stripped naked by oblivion”). I prefer to take the participle apekdusame-</p>
<p>nos as “having disarmed” and regard the middle voice as deponent (see Lohse 1971: 112; </p>
<p>Gnilka 1980: 142; Bruce 1984d: 297–98; Arnold 1996: 278; BDF § 316.1). Stanley Porter </p>
<p>(1994: 69) states that “Jesus Christ’s benecial or participatory stripping of the defeated </p>
<p>demonic enemies of their power makes better sense of the imagery.”</p>
