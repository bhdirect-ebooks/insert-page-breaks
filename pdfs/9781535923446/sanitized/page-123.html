<p>Importantly, the</p>
<p>mechanism by which this word of Messiah is communicated is through </p>
<p>instruction (teaching and admonishing each other) and in worship </p>
<p>(singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs),</p>
<p>42</p>
<p> and all of this is to oc-</p>
<p>cur in the context of thanksgiving.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>If we regard the impartation of the</p>
<p>word of Messiah as the goal of teaching, admonishing, and singing, then </p>
<p>we are led to the conclusion that teaching is meant to take on a worship-</p>
<p>ful character while musical praise is to take on a didactic role in order </p>
<p>to comprehensively impart the word. Christian teaching is not meant to </p>
<p>be dry, but soaked in thankful praise. Similarly, singing is not purposed </p>
<p>to be doctrinally benign but should comprise a pointer to the truth of </p>
<p>Jesus Christ. In the background to all of this is the notion that whatever </p>
<p>Christians do in worship, teaching, work, leisure, or life, they do in the </p>
<p>name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. </p>
<p>at is indicative of the binitarian nature of early Christian worship in </p>
<p>making the Father and Son the objects of religious devotion. Jesus, the </p>
<p>true image of God, who reconciled the believers to God, remains the </p>
<p>fountain from which all thanksgiving overows and is the one in whom </p>
<p>all worship of the Father takes place. What is given to Jesus becomes the </p>
<p>Father’s, and what is given to the Father is Jesus’s since he is the fullness </p>
<p>of God (Col 1:19–20; 2:9–10). A tting summary is given by eodoret </p>
<p>of Cyr: “It is because the Colossians were being directed to worship an-</p>
<p>gels that Paul felt compelled to teach what we read here. is is that they </p>
<p>should adorn their words and deeds with the remembrance of Christ the </p>

<p>42. e dierences between these three terms is hard to identify. A psalm (cf. 1 Cor </p>
<p>14:26) may refer to a biblical psalm sung accapella, a hymn (cf. Acts 16:25; Heb 2:12) </p>
<p>might include the accompaniment of a musical instrument, and spiritual songs (cf. </p>
<p>Rev 5:9; 14:3; 15:3) could include more extemporaneous or even ecstatic forms of me-</p>
<p>lodic praise. See further Lohse 1971: 151. Writing this commentary in the Highlands of </p>
<p>Scotland, where a number of denominations mandate the exclusive use of unaccompa-</p>
<p>nied psalmody in worship, makes me want to translate this verse as “psalms, unmusical </p>
<p>psalms, and even more psalms” for the amusing edication of my Free Church friends.</p>
<p>43. ere is no “and” or grammatical break between the participles teaching and </p>
<p>admonishing and the nouns that follow, psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. us, it </p>
<p>seems better to posit the phrasing as a coordinating series that connects the activities of </p>
<p>teaching and worship (against the niv, rsv, nrsv, and agreeing with the nasb, net, and </p>
<p>esv). See also Lightfoot 1879: 224; Bruce 1957: 283–84; O’Brien 1982: 208–9. On the </p>
<p>whole the participles also seem to have an imperatival force (BDF § 468:2).</p>
