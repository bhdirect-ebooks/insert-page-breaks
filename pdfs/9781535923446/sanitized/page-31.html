<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>e philosophy was clearly indebted to Judaism in some form given </p>
<p>the references to the Sabbath (2:16), circumcision (2:11), and food laws </p>
<p>(2:21). However, the references to the “powers” (1:16; 2:8, 10, 15), the </p>
<p>“worship of angels” (2:18), asceticism (2:21–23), festivals (2:16), and </p>
<p>wisdom (1:9, 2:3, 23; 3:16) could derive from a number of dierent reli-</p>
<p>gious and philosophical systems. If we add to that the melting pot of re-</p>
<p>ligions, philosophies, and magic in Phrygia (interior Asia Minor) where </p>
<p>syncretism was common and Jewish acculturation inevitable, it further </p>
<p>complicates our ability to pin down concretely the philosophy to any one </p>
<p>particular philosophical school or known religious movement. Even so, </p>
<p>three main options present themselves for consideration.</p>
<p>First, the “philosophy” could have derived from one of the Hellenistic </p>
<p>philosophical schools of Pythagoreanism,</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> Middle Platonism,</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>or even</p>
<p>Cynicism.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>e problem is, however, that “philosophy” is such a broad</p>
<p>category and many of the philosophies of the ancient world (Stoicism, </p>
<p>Pythagoreanism, Cynicism, etc.) oen overlapped in their metaphysi-</p>
<p>cal understanding of the world. Moreover, while it is conceivable that </p>
<p>Jewish philosophers could admix Hellenistic philosophy to their system </p>
<p>of belief, it is less likely that non-Jews would add Jewish rituals denoting </p>
<p>Jewish identity to their religious practices, especially Sabbath keeping and </p>
<p>circumcision.</p>
<p>Second, the philosophers might be advocating a syncretistic amal-</p>
<p>gam of Judaism and indigenous Phrygian practices of magic, mysteries, </p>
<p>and angel veneration. Nearly all commentators regard the philosophy as a </p>
<p>syncretism of some form.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> Philo appears to complain about the inltra-</p>
<p>tion of syncretism among the Jews of Alexandria, which poses a simi-</p>
<p>lar analogy.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>Martin Hengel and Anna Maria Schwemer point out that</p>
<p>around one third of the extant magical papyri and amulets are based on </p>
<p>Jewish elements.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>We also know from later papyri and patristic evidence</p>
<p>that even many Christians were willing to use magic spells for particular </p>
