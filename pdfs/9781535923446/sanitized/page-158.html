<p>pauL’s finaL greetings tO phiLemOn </p>
<p>(23–25)</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Messiah Jesus, sends</p>
<p>greetings to you, </p>
<p>24</p>
<p>and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas,</p>
<p>and Luke, my fellow workers. </p>
<p>25</p>
<p>e grace of the Lord Jesus</p>
<p>Christ be with your spirit.</p>
<p>Paul’s nal greeting is very reminiscent of Col 4:10–18 with the same co-</p>
<p>hort of persons named in both greetings. is is good proof that both let-</p>
<p>ters were written in close proximity to one another and probably from the </p>
<p>same location. Epaphras, the evangelist and rst pastor of the Lycus Valley </p>
<p>churches, is mentioned as a fellow prisoner in Messiah Jesus, and he may </p>
<p>well be attending to Paul’s needs under arrest (probably house arrest in a </p>
<p>rented room) or perhaps even under detention himself. is is a further </p>
<p>ascription of honor to Epaphras and it establishes a closer connection of </p>
<p>Epaphras to Paul, which would bolster the standing of Epaphras before </p>
<p>the Lycus Valley house churches. Also mentioned is Mark, Aristarchus, </p>
<p>Demas, and Luke who are Paul’s fellow workers for the kingdom. Paul </p>
<p>closes with a Christian benediction: e grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be </p>
<p>with your spirit. Importantly, the personal pronoun your is in the plural </p>
<p>and refers to Philemon’s household and the house church as well.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Ministerial Formation</p>
<p>There are several ways in which the letter to Philemon gives us cause to think </p>
<p>about ministerial formation: </p>
