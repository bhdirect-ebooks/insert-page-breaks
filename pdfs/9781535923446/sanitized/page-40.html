<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>sacramental initiation was made more attractive by dressing it up in a </p>
<p>Jewish term,</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> I think the reverse holds, viz., an essentially Jewish reli-</p>
<p>gious tradition is being dressed in a garb of Hellenistic philosophy and </p>
<p>language, thus appealing to Gentile believers who were formerly pagans </p>
<p>in the religious smorgasbord of the Lycus Valley.</p>
<p>The Situation Behind the Epistle to Philemon</p>
<p>So far we have tentatively concluded that the letter to Philemon was </p>
<p>written during 55–56 CE during Paul’s imprisonment in Ephesus. It was </p>
<p>composed due to the estrangement between Onesimus and Philemon, </p>
<p>which, aer Paul’s intervention, resulted in Philemon releasing Onesimus </p>
<p>to Paul’s care and service. Some time thereaer, Onesimus and Tychicus </p>
<p>were dispatched to the Lycus Valley to deliver the letters to the Colossians </p>
<p>and Laodiceans (Ephesians).</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>It is hard to say much about Paul’s relationship to Philemon and </p>
<p>Onesimus because we know very little of the specics. Philemon was evi-</p>
<p>dently a well-to-do Christian in a small Phyrigan town of the Lycus Valley </p>
<p>in Asia Minor, he was a slave owner, and a church met in his house which </p>
<p>was presumably led by himself, his wife Apphia, and Archippus. He seems </p>
<p>to have shared some kind of partnership/fellowship (koinōnon) with Paul </p>
<p>(v. 17), which elsewhere means becoming partners in ministry by sharing </p>
<p>material needs (see Acts 2:42; Phil 1:5; 2:1). Paul also says that Philemon </p>
<p>owes him his very own self, perhaps suggesting that Paul was signicant </p>
<p>in Philemon’s conversion and now the apostle seeks a mutual benet from </p>
<p>this relationship (v. 20). Onesimus is known from Colossians as “one of </p>
<p>yourselves” and he later travelled with Tychicus to Colossae (Col 4:7–9). </p>
<p>He was a slave who had come to Paul, or perhaps he sought out Epaphras </p>
<p>and Paul together because they were esteemed by his master and could </p>
<p>mediate between them. Or else maybe one of Paul’s associates found </p>
<p>him hiding somewhere in want of food and shelter. Sometime during </p>
<p>89. Lohse 1971: 130.</p>
<p>90. About Philemon and Colossians we have already noted that: (1) they are both </p>
<p>written during a Pauline imprisonment, (2) they have the same coauthor in Timothy, (3) </p>
<p>they share the same list of Pauline coworkers in the closing greetings, and (4) there is no </p>
<p>mention of the Philemon/Onesimus tension in Colossians, which led us to infer that the </p>
<p>ri had been healed and Onesimus is called a “faithful and beloved brother” implying </p>
<p>that he had proven himself in service. us, the letter to Philemon probably precedes that </p>
<p>written to the Colossians by some time.</p>
