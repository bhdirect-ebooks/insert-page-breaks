<p>Colossians 3:12–17</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>love-driven unity is the reference to the peace of Messiah, which is a geni-</p>
<p>tive of origin, or the peace that comes from Christ, which is to arbitrate </p>
<p>in the heart (see John 14:27, “peace I leave with you, my peace I give to </p>
<p>you”). Peace seems to have three basic meanings or uses in Paul and all of </p>
<p>these are present in Colossians: as a general greeting and blessing along </p>
<p>with “grace” (Col 1:2; cf. e.g., Rom 1:7; Gal 1:3; Eph 1:2); as signifying </p>
<p>the end of hostilities between God and the believer due to Jesus’s death </p>
<p>and resurrection (Col 1:20; cf. e.g., Rom 5:1; Eph 2:14–17); and as part of </p>
<p>ethical instruction towards good relations and ecclesial unity (Col 3:15; </p>
<p>cf. e.g., Rom 12:18; 14:17–19; Gal 5:22; Eph 4:3). e command to let </p>
<p>peace arbitrate in the heart or permeate one’s inner self is made because it </p>
<p>is a corollary of being called to be part of one body. By this Paul probably </p>
<p>means to live at peace with other Christians (something he knew much </p>
<p>of aer painful debates in Antioch, Galatia, and Corinth). Hence there is </p>
<p>some justication for adopting the translation let the peace of Messiah </p>
<p>arbitrate in your hearts in the sense that the peace of Messiah acts as an </p>
<p>arbiter when dierences between fellow believers arise.</p>

<p>e same word</p>
<p>(brabeuō) occurs in 2:18: “let no one disqualify you” (“be in control of </p>
<p>your heart” [net]; “be umpire” [Lightfoot]). e peace of Messiah acts as </p>
<p>an umpire, referee, or arbiter in the community of the new age. By living </p>
<p>at peace with fellow Christians, one expresses thankfulness to God for his </p>
<p>work in Jesus Christ. To that is added the word of Messiah, and the geni-</p>
<p>tive is ambiguous for the reason that it could be an objective genitive (the </p>
<p>word about Messiah) or else a subjective genitive (the word that comes </p>
<p>from Messiah). ere is no reason to have to choose here, and the word </p>
<p>(logos) probably denotes all Christian instruction that either derives from </p>
<p>the Messiah or has the Messiah as its content and integrating point—what </p>
<p>Calvin called “the doctrine of the gospel.”</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>e word is meant to dwell</p>
<p>among them or inhabit their persons. As Wisdom found a dwelling place </p>
<p>in Israel (Sir 24:8) and the Spirit of God dwells in believers (1 Cor 3:16; </p>
<p>Rom 8:9), so must the word of Messiah reside within the community in </p>

<p>40. Calvin 1979a: 216; and similarly Barth and Blanke 1994: 426; Dunn 1996: 236. </p>
<p>Cf. Hendriksen (1964: 160) who describes the genitive as “the Christ-word,” that is, the </p>
<p>revelation which proceeds from and concerns Christ. Lohse (1971: 150) identies it as </p>
<p>the “gospel of Christ” and “word of truth”; O’Brien (1982: 206–7) takes it to mean “the </p>
<p>message that centers on Christ, that Word of truth or gospel”; Martin (1973: 115) and </p>
<p>Wright (1986: 144) take it as a synonym for Paul’s message.</p>
