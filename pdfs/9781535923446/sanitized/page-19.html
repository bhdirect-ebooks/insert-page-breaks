<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>ere are a number of legitimate reasons for disputing the letter’s </p>
<p>authenticity: (1) e language of Colossians is somewhat dierent from </p>
<p>the Hauptbriefe or “main letters” of Paul—Romans, 1–2 Corinthians, </p>
<p>and Galatians—as well as the undisputed letters of First essalonians, </p>
<p>Philippians, and Philemon. (2) e theology of Colossians is also said </p>
<p>to be more developed than the main epistles, particularly in its high </p>
<p>Christology, catholic ecclesiology, and realized eschatology. Nonetheless, </p>
<p>most acknowledge that Colossians still has a very Pauline buzz about it in </p>
<p>terms of cadence, ethos, tone, and content; it is as close to his mind as one </p>
<p>might expect. For this reason, many commentators have followed Ernst </p>
<p>Käsemann’s dictum: “if genuine, as late as possible, because of the content </p>
<p>and style; if not genuine, as early as conceivable.”</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>It is my contention, however, that despite some valid objections, </p>
<p>Colossians is authentic and written during the apostle’s own lifetime in </p>
<p>collaboration with his coworkers.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>First of all, a number of authors have</p>
<p>argued that Colossians is pseudonymous based on statistical and lin-</p>
<p>guistic comparisons with the undisputed letters.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>For instance, there are</p>
<p>thirty-four hapax legomena in Colossians (i.e., words that occur nowhere </p>
<p>else in the New Testament), twenty-eight words that appear elsewhere </p>
<p>in the New Testament but nowhere else in Paul, several stylistic pecu-</p>
<p>liarities such as synonymous expressions (e.g., “praying and asking,” 1:9) </p>
<p>and dependent genitives (e.g., “the word of truth, of the gospel,” 1:5), and </p>
<p>the absence of key Pauline words like “law,” “righteousness/justication,” </p>
<p>“salvation” and “sin” that one might expect Paul to have used in tackling </p>
<p>a philosophy with Jewish traits.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Yet the linguistic data may not be fully</p>
<p>decisive against Pauline authorship.</p>
<p>(1) We do not have a pure “control” sample of Paul’s own writings that we </p>
<p>can be absolutely sure are exclusively his own wording/writing and </p>
<p>thus make use of it as a template for comparison with Colossians. </p>

<p>18. Cf. especially the positive case for Pauline authorship in O’Brien 1982: xli–xlix; </p>
<p>Smith 2006: 6–14. In particular, it seems hard to place Col 4:7–17 in a post-Pauline con-</p>
<p>text. Furthermore, deSilva (2004: 701) argues that the contents are exactly what we would </p>
<p>expect from an astute pastoral leader concerning: (a) reliance on shared traditions, (b) </p>
<p>Paul’s brief reection on his own calling in God’s purpose, and (c) personal matters like </p>
<p>prayer requests, personal greetings, and personal exhortations.</p>
