<p>Transformed and Renewed</p>

<p>an ethical paradigm for the Colossians that nds its imperative neither in </p>
<p>playing on their old pagan superstitious fears nor by foisting on them the </p>
<p>Mosaic code, but apprehends righteousness and holiness from the power </p>
<p>of renewal working in them because Messiah dwells in them.</p>
<p>The Basis of the New Life: </p>
<p>Union with the Risen and Exalted Messiah (3:1–4)</p>
<p>It is possible to take Col 3:1–4 as a transitional section that summarizes </p>
<p>the argument in 2:9–23 while also looking forward to the exhortation of </p>
<p>3:5—4:6.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>In vv. 1–4 Paul urges the Colossians to understand their very</p>
<p>own identities as being bound up with Jesus Christ, and this most natu-</p>
<p>rally lends itself to seeking and setting their minds on the things above </p>
<p>where Christ is seated and not orienting themselves towards earthly </p>
<p>things. Paul premises this argument with the statement about participa-</p>
<p>tion in Christ’s resurrection and death. He says, if then you have been </p>
<p>raised with Messiah, which grammatically is posed in such a way that </p>
<p>the circumstances are assumed to be true.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>ey have been raised with</p>
<p>Messiah and this impacts the thought life and values of the Colossian </p>
<p>Christians.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>e accompanying commands seek and set your mind upon</p>
<p>the things above is not pietistic escapism but refers to a steadfast devotion </p>
<p>to Jesus Christ which determines the attitudes of the believer. e things </p>
<p>above stand for the hope of the gospel (1:5), the invisible God (1:15), </p>
<p>5. Wolter (1993: 164–65) identies Col 3:1–4 as a peroratio and recapitulating the </p>
<p>argumentatio of Col 2:9–23 and preparing for the exhortatio in Col 3:5–4:6. Cf. also </p>
<p>O’Brien 1982: 157–58 for the looking backward and forward function of this section.</p>
<p>6. Abbott 1897: 278; Martin 1973: 100; O’Brien 1982: 158; Wright 1986: 131; Barth </p>
<p>and Blanke 1994: 392; Garland 1998: 201. For a similar strategy see Phil 2:1–4 where </p>
<p>Paul uses the same if/since style of argument in aid of ethical exhortation.</p>
<p>7. Elsewhere Paul speaks of being crucied with Christ (Gal 2:20; Rom 6:6), died/</p>
<p>baptized/buried with Christ (Rom 6:3–5), but he only ever speaks of being raised with </p>
<p>Christ in the future tense (Rom 6:5). Several scholars seize on this and argue that the </p>
<p>author of Colossians and Ephesians has collapsed the eschatological future, the “not-yet” </p>
<p>into the present and have essentially a wholly realized eschatology. A number of things </p>
<p>count against this view (see the introduction as well): (1) e “not-yet” or unrealized </p>
<p>aspect of the salvation experience is very much on the fore of Colossians as is evident </p>
<p>from 3:3–4, 10, 24–25, and 4:2. (2) Dunn (1996: 201) is right when he states that this </p>
<p>section “maintains a characteristically Pauline balance between teaching and parenesis, </p>
<p>‘already and ‘not yet,’ heavenly perspective and everyday responsibility.” See also McL. </p>
<p>Wilson (2005: 236, 240, 252) who thinks the author exceeds Paul but remains true to </p>
<p>Paul’s overall eschatological perspective.</p>
