<p>Authorship</p>
<p>Philemon is ordinarily regarded as genuinely Pauline and no new reasons </p>
<p>have been adduced to doubt this fact. e style and vocabulary of Philemon, </p>
<p>typied by the opening and closing sections, is characteristically Pauline. </p>
<p>e overall linguistic variation of the contents also remains well within </p>
the diversity attested by the undisputed letters of Paul. Philemon would
<p>also seem to be an odd letter for a pseudepigrapher to compose given that </p>
<p>it lacks doctrinally polemical content. us, we possess every condence </p>
<p>that it was written by Paul. e authorship of Colossians, on the other </p>
<p>hand, is (with Second essalonians, Ephesians, and the Pastoral Epistles) </p>
<p>disputed.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>It is proposed by many that Colossians is a pseudonymous</p>
<p>letter (but not necessarily an ill-intended forgery) written in Paul’s name </p>
<p>by a post-Pauline disciple. It was given the appearance of verisimilitude </p>
<p>by ctitiously addressing the letter to an obscure community that Paul </p>
<p>did not visit and one that probably ceased to exist aer the earthquake of </p>
<p>61–62 CE. is would ensure the unlikelihood of any one being able to </p>
<p>falsify its origins, whereas it was really intended as a general admonition </p>
<p>for churches in Roman Asia sometime around the 70–80s.</p>

<p>15. Technically, Ephesians and the Pastoral Epistles are the so-called “Deutero-</p>
<p>Pauline” letters, while Colossians and Second essalonians are the proper “Disputed </p>
<p>Pauline” letters. Cf. Mead 1986: 118.</p>
<p>16. Cf. recently Lohse 1971: 181; Pokorný 1991: 21; Lincoln 2000: 580; Wilson 2005: </p>
<p>17–19; but against this scenario is Schweizer 1982: 19–21; Wedderburn 1987: 70; Dunn </p>
<p>1996: 37.</p>
