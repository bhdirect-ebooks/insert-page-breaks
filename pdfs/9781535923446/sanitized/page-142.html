<p>Fusing the Horizons: Christian Leaders</p>

<p>2. Servant and Slave. Common in Colossians is the description of Paul’s </p>
<p>coworkers as “fellow servants” and “fellow slaves.” One has to ask whether </p>
<p>views of ministry in afﬂuent Western cultures have been adversely inﬂuenced </p>
<p>by corporate styles of leadership and images of success. If one is going into </p>
<p>the “ministry” it should mean that one is going to become a servant of God, </p>
<p>or more speciﬁcally, one is going to become a servant of God by serving the </p>
<p>people of God.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>But somewhere along the line we began to think of ourselves</p>
<p>as “religious professionals” rather than “ministers.” In fact, some churches </p>
<p>have even reorganized their leadership structures to reﬂect corporate models, </p>
<p>with the senior pastor becoming a de facto CEO and other staff becoming vice </p>
<p>presidents of marketing, recruitment, human resources, youth services, and </p>
<p>estates. The language of the New Testament is not that of “reverend” or “se-</p>
<p>nior pastor” but of “slaves” and “servants” of Jesus the Christ. What we want </p>
<p>ourselves to be called obviously reﬂects how we want ourselves to be perceived </p>
<p>by others. Are we religious professionals on par with corporate professionals? </p>
<p>Or are we ministers of the new covenant, called to service not greatness, full </p>
<p>of humility not boasting, inspired by heaven not earthly recognition, and ﬁlling </p>
<p>our ﬂesh with afﬂictions not ﬁlling our pockets with cash? Servants and slaves </p>
<p>seek not honor for themselves, but honor and glory for their master.</p>
<p>3. The Archippus Factor. I have been involved in a variety of Christian </p>
<p>ministries in the military, in public schools, in homes, in churches, and on </p>
<p>university campuses. I have never been a pastor myself; nonetheless, I have </p>
<p>much experience in training them for ministry in the Word of God and teaching </p>
<p>them how to think theologically. One thing I have learned is that all ministry, </p>
<p>especially pastoral ministry, can be tiring, difﬁcult, discouraging, draining, </p>
<p>and often thankless work. Pastors often see the worst side of Christians, they </p>
<p>can ﬁnd themselves hounded by people with constant needs, counseling </p>
<p>people with marital problems, having to mediate between disputing persons, </p>
<p>and working hard to prepare sermons that are not always appreciated let alone </p>
<p>heeded. All ministers, like Archippus, are in desperate need of regular encour-</p>
<p>agement, reassurance, and gratitude. They need to be told, by the church and </p>
by individuals, to “fulﬁll your ministry which you received in the Lord.” Under
<p>times of upheaval and adversity this is all the more important. I was once in </p>
<p>a church in North Queensland, Australia where the pastor was preaching a </p>
<p>two part series on “The Bible and Homosexuality.” After the ﬁrst sermon the </p>
<p>10. I would add that the diakoneō/diakonos word group for “serving” and “servant/</p>
<p>deacon” indicates activity rather than status (see Hentschel 2007).</p>
