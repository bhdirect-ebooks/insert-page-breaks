<p>Morna Hooker proposed</p>
<p>that there actually was no heresy or false teachers in Colossae and Paul </p>
<p>merely writes a general admonition to urge the congregation there not </p>
<p>to conform to the beliefs and practices of their Jewish and pagan neigh-</p>
<p>bors.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>But the portrayal of the philosophy seems far too specic and the</p>
<p>use of the indenite pronouns suggests that Paul genuinely did have some </p>
group or individual in mind (2:8, 16, 18). Others advocate not a Jewish
<p>or pagan threat to the Colossian church, but a Christian heresy based </p>
<p>on the mystery religions,</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> the Ebionites,</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>or a syncretism involving the</p>
<p>Christian gospel, Judaism, and Hellenistic cosmology.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>While there might</p>
<p>be some grounds for suggesting that the philosophy has begun impacting </p>
<p>the Colossians (e.g., 2:19), for the most part it seems that it remains an </p>
<p>external and decidedly non-Christian threat. Paul would be unlikely to </p>
<p>commend the Colossians’ faithfulness and steadfastness if they had suc-</p>
<p>cumbed to the philosophy (1:4; 2:5). Never are the “teachers” in Colossae </p>
<p>charged with denying Jesus, perverting the gospel, or with being “false” as </p>
<p>Paul alleges of his opponents elsewhere (see Gal 1:7; 2:4–5; 5:2–4; 2 Cor </p>
<p>11:4; cf. Jude 4; 1 John 4:1–2; Rev 2:2).</p>
<p>47. Gunther 1973; and see surveys in Francis 1975; Stettler 2005; Smith 2006: </p>
<p>19–38.</p>
<p>48. Hooker 1973; but see response by Gnilka 1980: 163–64 n. 4. Calvin (1979a: 132–</p>
<p>33) saw Paul confronting worldly philosophy on the one hand with its reference to “stars, </p>
<p>fate, the tries of a like nature” and the Jews on the other hand who urged “observance </p>
<p>of their ceremonies” and “had raised up many mists with a view of throwing Christ into </p>
<p>the shade.” ese Jews are clearly Jewish Christians for Calvin, and he says that they tried </p>
<p>to “mix up Christ with Moses, and might retain the shadows of the law along with the </p>
<p>gospel.” roughout the commentary he calls them “false apostles.” At the same time </p>
<p>Calvin saw these false teachers as Hellenistic to some extent and concerned with specula-</p>
<p>tions contained in the books of Dionysius on the Celestial Hierarchy stemming from the </p>
<p>Platonic school. Calvin emphasizes at length Paul’s critique of Jewish ceremonies (1979a: </p>
<p>181–82, 188–89), which he sees pregnant even in the “elements” (2:8) and “written code” </p>
<p>(2:14).</p>
<p>49. Cf. e.g., Dibelius 1975: 99.</p>
<p>50. Baur 2003 [1873–75]: 2.28–32.</p>
<p>51. Cf. e.g., Lincoln (2000: 567) who writes: “[T]he proponent(s) of the teaching have </p>
<p>taken a number of elements from Judaism and the Christian gospel and linked these </p>
<p>with typical cosmological concerns from the Hellenistic world. It is quite plausible that </p>
<p>a Hellenistic Jew who had le the synagogue to join a Pauline congregation or a Gentile </p>
<p>convert who had had some previous contact with the synagogue would advocate such a </p>
<p>philosophy, and the writer evidently was concerned that it might appeal to others among </p>
<p>his preponderantly Gentile Christian readers.” Similarly, see Arnold 1996: 228–29.</p>
