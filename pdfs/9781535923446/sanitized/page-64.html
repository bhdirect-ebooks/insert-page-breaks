<p>Colossians 1:15–20</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>known paradigm is radically redrawn around a particular view of Israel’s </p>
Messiah as participating in the divine acts of creation and redemption.
<p>e structure is particularly hard to determine, mainly because </p>
<p>the wording is asymmetrical, and the shi from vv. 12–14 to vv. 15–20 </p>
<p>is hardly abrupt. e most likely option appears to be that the poem is </p>
<p>framed in two major strophes (vv. 15–16; 18b–20) both beginning with a </p>
<p>relative clause and with two lines (vv. 17–18a) sandwiched in the middle </p>
<p>functioning as an abridgment.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>In my opinion, the coherence and unity</p>
<p>of the poem is based around certain key motifs in both strophes that are </p>
<p>activated by certain words. </p>
<p>He is . . . Divine Personhood: e identity of Jesus in </p>
<p>relation to God.</p>
<p>Firstborn Divine Preeminence: e supremacy of Jesus over </p>
<p>creation and new creation.</p>
<p>Because Divine Perspective: An explanation of how Jesus </p>
<p>relates to the prerogatives and presence of God.</p>
<p>In him Divine Agency: What purposes God works out </p>
<p>through the Son.</p>
<p>Whether . . . Divine Authority: Signals the extent of the Son’s </p>
<p>reign over creation and salvation.</p>
<p>In terms of a rhetorical function, this passage operates much like </p>
<p>a propositio, which sets forth the central thesis of the epistle.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>It also</p>
<p>has some anities with Asiatic rhetoric, which tended to be far more </p>
<p>ornamented, owery, and even pompous at times. is rich tapestry of </p>
<p>highly poetic and poignant christological imagery is set forth in order to </p>
<p>10. Cf. Martin 1973: 55–56; Lincoln 2000: 602–3; McL. Wilson 2005: 126–27, al-</p>
<p>though I remain unsure about making vv. 17–18a a “strophe” of its own.</p>
<p>11. According to MacDonald (2008: 67) the principle themes of Colossians are an-</p>
<p>nounced in this hymn, including: Christ’s preeminence as foundation for the arguments </p>
<p>against the “philosophers,” the reigning Christ prepares the way for the proclamation that </p>
<p>believers have been raised and co-enthroned with Christ, and body symbolism which is </p>
<p>central to the cosmic and social integration of Colossians. For Lohse (1971: 178) this </p>
<p>section provides the leitmotif that runs throughout the letter and is the basis for all subse-</p>
<p>quent christological reection. Barth and Blanke (1994: 194) say of Col 1:15–20, “ese </p>
<p>thoughts form the basis for the principal armation of Col.” As such I disagree with </p>
<p>Witherington (2007: 128) who sees it as part of the narratio, and Lincoln (2000: 557) </p>
<p>who identies it within the exordium.</p>
