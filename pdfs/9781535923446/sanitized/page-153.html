<p>e Pathos and Persuasion of the Apostle</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>common meaning of a mother giving birth, and (2) Paul refers to his </p>
<p>splanchna in verses 8 and 10, which, though I have translated as heart </p>
<p>(the seat of one’s emotions), could also be translated as “womb.” us, </p>
<p>as in Gal 4:19, Paul exhibits an intense motherly care for the welfare and </p>
<p>well-being of his spiritual progeny.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Paul uses positive and aectionate</p>
<p>language for Onesimus throughout the epistle, referring to Onesimus as </p>
<p>“my child” (v. 10), “my very heart” (v. 12), “beloved brother” (v. 17), and </p>
<p>in Colossians as his “beloved and faithful brother’ (Col 4:9). e point </p>
<p>is to underscore Paul’s deep aection for Onesimus. e aection has </p>
<p>grown out of Onesimus’s conversion and this has wrought a transforma-</p>
<p>tion in Onesimus in that he was formerly useless but is now useful. is </p>
<p>is on account of the step of faith that the slave made while seeking Paul’s </p>
<p>intercession on his behalf. ere is a double play on words here. First, the </p>
<p>name Onesimus (Onēsimos) means “useful, protable” and was a com-</p>
<p>mon slave name in Asia Minor.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>What is meant by useless (achrēstos) and</p>
<p>useful (euchrēstos) is unclear; it might be retrospective and comparative, </p>
<p>that is, Onesimus was formerly useless to us all, but now he has genuine </p>
<p>usefulness (so much so that Paul would like to enlist him into his service). </p>
<p>Second, there might also be a deliberate play on the words achrēstos and </p>
<p>euchrēstos since they sound similar to Christos (“Christ”) or Christianos </p>
<p>(“Christian”). As such, Onesimus was formerly achrēstos when he was </p>
<p>without Christ, but he is now euchrēstos as a Christianos.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Despite the usefulness of Onesimus and Paul’s deep aection for him, </p>
<p>this itself did not override Paul’s sense of obligation to return Onesimus </p>
<p>back to his master. In vv. 13–14 the apostle expresses his heavy-hearted </p>
<p>willingness to return Onesimus to Philemon as well as stating his desire </p>
<p>to keep him. Paul remarks that he would very much have liked to have </p>
<p>retained the services of Onesimus for the reason that he might serve me </p>
<p>on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel. e service </p>
<p>(diakoneō) that Onesimus might conceivably oer could be manifold. </p>
<p>Many slaves were literate, well-educated, and capable administrators. </p>
<p>Onesimus might provide service as a Pauline messenger (2 Cor 8:19–20; </p>
<p>9:3; Eph 6:22), discharge an unspecied ministry of some kind (Matt 8:15; </p>
<p>27:55; John 12:26; Acts 19:22; 2 Tim 1:18; 1 Pet 4:10–11), or perhaps even </p>
<p>2. See discussion in Barth and Blanke 2000: 329–35.</p>
