<p>Fusing the Horizons: Christian Leaders</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>local gay rights group heard about the sermon series, said some slanderous </p>
<p>things about him in a newspaper interview (i.e., accusing him of saying that </p>
<p>AIDS is God’s punishment against homosexuals, which he never said) and </p>
<p>planned to stage a protest at the church the next Sunday. There was a mid-</p>
<p>week prayer meeting planned, and we learned that all four major TV stations </p>
<p>were sending crews to ﬁlm the event. The pastor looked visibly tired and worn </p>
<p>out by the stress and tension (we were all taken by surprise over how quickly </p>
<p>and intensely the whole affair erupted), but at that midweek meeting there </p>
<p>were no calls for him to back down, no criticism of his leadership, no hate </p>
<p>mongering against homosexuals, but prayer and encouragement for the pastor </p>
<p>to ﬁnish what he started and to boldly proclaim the word of God. It was a word </p>
<p>of encouragement that he desperately needed. The new covenant community </p>
<p>needs to be one where encouragement for its slaves and servants is not a </p>
<p>rarity but a regular event, especially in times of trial and hardship. This is the </p>
<p>Archippus Factor!</p>
