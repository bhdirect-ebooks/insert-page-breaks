<p>Colossians 1:15–16</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>tion; Heb 1:3, where Jesus is the “radiance” and “exact replica” of God’s </p>
<p>glory and being; and obviously 2 Cor. 4:4, where the glorious Christ is </p>
<p>the “image of God.” e key ideas are representation and manifestation.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e mention of image also relates back to Gen 1:26–27 where Adam and </p>
Eve were the bearers of the divine image. What the imago Dei (image of
<p>God) exactly is remains disputed by theologians. Since kings in the an-</p>
<p>cient Near East were supposed to be the image or shadow of God, it may </p>
<p>mean no more than that humanity is royal in God’s eyes.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>at accords</p>
<p>with the role given to humanity as rulers over creation in Gen 1:26–30 </p>
<p>and the focus of the poem on Jesus’s sovereignty. As the image of God, </p>
<p>then, Jesus is the new eschatological Adam of God’s renewed creation, </p>
<p>which corresponds once more with what Paul says elsewhere in 1 Cor </p>
<p>15:45, 47, where Christ, by virtue of his resurrection, is the “last Adam” </p>
<p>and “second man.” e image is related to the invisible God. at God </p>
<p>was invisible (i.e., beyond the realm of human perception) was axiomatic </p>
<p>in Jewish thought and rearmed in the New Testament (e.g., Rom 1:20; </p>
<p>1 Tim 1:17; Heb 11:27). Indeed, as the image of God, Jesus makes the </p>
<p>invisible visible for all to behold, underscoring the revelatory function </p>
<p>of his imaging of God.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>In sum, as the image of the invisible God, Jesus</p>
<p>is: (1) of the same likeness or form of God; (2) the beginning of the new </p>
<p>eschatological humanity,;and (3) the one who reveals God to human be-</p>
<p>ings in his very person.</p>
<p>Paul then adds that Jesus is the rstborn of all of creation. Firstborn </p>
<p>literally means “eldest child” (e.g., Gen 25:25 lxx; Luke 2:7; Heb 11:28). </p>
<p>In a Greco-Roman household the rstborn was the designated heir </p>
<p>of the estate, while in the Old Testament the rstborn son had special </p>
<p>privileges of inheritance (Deut 21:15–17) and was dedicated to God (e.g., </p>
<p>Exod 22:29; Num 3:12–13; 8:17–18). We should note also that Israel is </p>
<p>called God’s “rstborn son” (Exod 4:22; Jer 31:9; 4 Ezra 6:58; Pss. Sol. </p>
<p>18:4; Philo Fug. 208) and Israel’s king is likewise referred to as the “rst-</p>
<p>born” and the “highest of the kings of the earth” (Ps 89:27). e word </p>
<p>rstborn (prōtotokos) has also been a playground for ancient and modern </p>
<p>theologians in light of controversies about the nature of Christ (especially </p>
<p>17. Lightfoot 1879: 145–46.</p>
<p>18. Cf. NDIEC 9:15, which mentions a papyrus ca. 221–25 BCE that refers to a king </p>
<p>who is said to be “the living image of God.”</p>
<p>19. Cf. Martin (1973: 57): “e description is revelatory, more than ontological.”</p>
