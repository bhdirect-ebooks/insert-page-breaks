<p>e Supremacy of Messiah in Creation and Reconciliation</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>pleased to have all his fullness inhabit the Messiah. e word for fullness </p>
<p>(plērōma) was a near technical term in Valentinian Gnosticism for the </p>
<p>totality of intermediaries or emanations radiating from the supreme God. </p>
<p>ere may be an implied critique here of something from Hellenistic phi-</p>
<p>losophy that eventually became part of a gnostic cosmological framework </p>
<p>and might even be part of the Colossian philosophy,</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>but the main point</p>
<p>is surely christological: the fullness of God—God’s word, wisdom, glory, </p>
<p>Spirit, and power—dwells in the Messiah.</p>
<p>In much the same way that this poem attributes to Jesus agency </p>
<p>in creation, so now he is regarded as God’s agent in reconciliation. Paul </p>
<p>says that through him or by the activity of the Messiah, God was able to </p>
<p>reconcile to himself all things. e word reconcile (katalassō) means to </p>
<p>exchange hostility for a friendly relationship.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>is implies a prior state of</p>
<p>alienation and hostility between Creator and the creation which has now </p>
<p>been restored (see Col 1:12; 2:15). Here we nd that the oended party, </p>
<p>God, takes the initiative in reconciliation in order to remove the hostility </p>
<p>between himself and his creation. Furthermore, the object of reconcilia-</p>
<p>tion is not merely human beings, but all things, which gives reconciliation </p>
<p>a cosmic scope as Paul says in 2 Cor 5:19: “God was in Christ reconcil-</p>
<p>ing the world to himself.”</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>As Lohse comments, the “universe has been</p>
<p>reconciled in that heaven and earth have been brought back into their </p>
divinely created and determined order . . . the universe is again under its
<p>head and . . . cosmic peace has returned.”</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> e mechanism of reconcilia-</p>
<p>tion and thus peace is through the blood of his cross, and Paul elsewhere </p>
<p>refers to the blood of Jesus’s death with its particular atoning function in </p>
<p>securing forgiveness, redemption, and justication (e.g., Rom 3:24–25; </p>
<p>4:7; 5:9). Just as things in the heavens and the earth were created in him, </p>
<p>so now are all things in the same realms are reconciled to God through </p>
<p>the blood of the cross.</p>
