<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>signicantly revising (or reversing) that plan. Alternatively, the remark </p>
<p>may simply be rhetorical and a polite wish to visit but with no actual </p>
<p>intent to do so (my in-laws in Australia threaten to visit me in Scotland </p>
<p>all the time but thankfully only rarely do so) and remain consistent with a </p>
<p>Roman setting. Fourth, according to ancient sources there was an earth-</p>
<p>quake that destroyed parts of the Lycus Valley, especially Laodicea, ca. </p>
<p>61–62 CE.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>We do not hear of any references to Christians there in extant</p>
<p>sources and only Laodicea is mentioned among the seven churches that </p>
<p>John the Seer wrote to at the end of the rst century (Rev 1:11; 3:14). Even </p>
<p>so, we do not know for sure how the Christians in Colossae were aected </p>
<p>by the earthquake and what impact it had upon their lives. True enough, </p>
<p>Paul does not mention the earthquake when we might expect him to do </p>
<p>so, but neither does he mention other “seismic” events such as the expul-</p>
<p>sion of Jews from Rome under Claudius (49 CE) and their return under </p>
<p>Nero (54 CE) when he wrote to the Romans.</p>
<p>e evidence is tightly balanced (and I confess to having changed </p>
<p>my mind a number of times). e answer, I think, lies not with inter-</p>
<p>nal evidence from Colossians or Philemon, but with the letter to the </p>
<p>Philippians and the movements of Timothy. He is named as cosender of </p>
<p>Colossians and Philemon (Col 1:1; Phlm 1). To that we can add the obser-</p>
<p>vations that Timothy is also named as cosender of Philippians (Phil 1:1), </p>
<p>Philippians is also written from captivity (Phil 1:13–14), and Philippians </p>
<p>is similar to Philemon in at least two other respects: both look forward </p>
<p>to Paul’s eventual release from prison (Phlm 22; Phil 1:19–26; 2:24), and </p>
<p>there are several stylistic similarities between them as noted by Francis </p>
<p>Watson.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>By way of deduction, my line of reasoning runs Timothy →</p>
<p>Philippians → Philemon → Colossians → Location! us, the circumstanc-</p>
<p>es of Philippians and Timothy are crucial for the provenance and date of </p>
<p>Colossians/Philemon.</p>
<p>Philippians could have been written from either Rome or Ephesus, </p>
<p>but the internal and external evidence to decide the matter is much stron-</p>
<p>ger. ere is a reference to the “praetorian guard” in Phil 1:13, which may </p>
<p>denote the elite body guard unit of the emperor in Rome, which also </p>
<p>functioned as a police force in the capital. ere is also a reference to a </p>
<p>greeting from those of “Caesar’s household” in Phil 4:22, which would </p>
<p>naturally t a Roman setting. However, “praetorian” can mean more </p>
