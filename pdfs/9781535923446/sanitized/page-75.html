<p>Reconciliation and the Colossians</p>
<p>61</p>
who have been granted access to the divine mystery that centers on the
<p>Messiah.</p>
<p>With the mention of you, Paul applies the foregoing section to </p>
<p>the Colossians directly by involving them in the cosmic saga of recon-</p>
<p>ciliation. eir prior condition is described as alienated and enemies in </p>
<p>thought, which denotes their active opposition and hostility to God as </p>
<p>expressed by their evil deeds. ese evil deeds probably consist of the </p>
<p>set of inappropriate behaviors listed in Col 3:5–9 which typies the un-</p>
<p>believing Gentile world. is dire condition is then markedly contrasted </p>
<p>with the advent of reconciliation. e now marks a redemptive-historical </p>
<p>transition in the state of the Colossians’ relationship to God, which comes </p>
<p>through the apocalyptic invasion of the cosmos by God’s rectifying work </p>
<p>to restore order and justice to the created realm (see Rom 3:21; 6:22; 7:6; </p>
<p>11:30; 1 Cor 15:20). ey have been reconciled, hostilities and opposi-</p>
<p>tion ended, through the body of his esh through death. e words for </p>
<p>“body” (sōma) and “esh” (sarx) can sometimes be synonymous, but </p>
<p>“esh” normally has negative connotations related to human weakness, </p>
<p>frailty, and sinfulness.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> Yet here they denote, almost crudely, the physical-</p>
<p>ity of Jesus’s work involving death as the termination of his human life </p>
<p>(cf. net; niv; njb).</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>e point is clear: the reconciler is the human Jesus,</p>
<p>and the means of reconciliation is his cross. e purpose of Jesus’s death </p>
<p>is that the Colossians be presented before God as holy and without blem-</p>
<p>ish and irreproachable. ese three descriptions use sacricial cultic im-</p>
<p>agery and relate to a particular status rather than to a moral state; it is the </p>
<p>absence of guilt or blame that marks those who are reconciled. e him of </p>
<p>before him is indeterminate, it could be Jesus or the Father, but given the </p>
<p>preceding context it seems to be a reference to Jesus as the judge on the </p>
<p>day of judgment (see John 5:26–30; Acts 17:31; Rom 2:16; 2 Tim 4:1).</p>
<p>is salvation is contingent upon perseverance, as they must remain </p>
<p>rmly rooted in the faith understood as the received body of Christian </p>
<p>teaching. Or, put negatively, not swerving from the hope of the gos-</p>
<p>pel, or departing from the hope laid up for them in heaven (1:5). e </p>
<p>nature of the Greek “if . . . remain” is a conditional clause and assumes </p>
<p>the truthfulness of the proposition set forth; in other words, Paul warns </p>
<p>them of failure but seems to presume upon a positive outcome in their </p>
