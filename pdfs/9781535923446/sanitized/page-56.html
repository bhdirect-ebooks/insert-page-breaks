<p>source and content of true knowledge. is form of knowledge accords </p>
<p>with God’s will or purpose, it is spiritual as opposed to philosophical, </p>
<p>and derives from a God-centered wisdom rather than a human derived </p>
<p>tradition. at God grants understanding is axiomatic in Judaism (e.g., </p>
<p>Dan 2:21; 9:22; 1QS 11:17–18; Wis 9:17; Sir 39:6–7), but Paul’s conviction </p>
<p>is that it is the Spirit of God as known through Christ who brings discern-</p>
<p>ment to the things of God (see 1 Cor 2:6–16). What is more, the true test </p>
<p>of religious learning is its ability to transform behavior, precisely what </p>
<p>the philosophy lacks (see 2:23). Hence, Paul’s prayer for the Colossians </p>
<p>is that through apprehension of this knowledge they walk worthily of </p>
<p>the Lord and pleasing him in every way, bearing fruit in every good </p>
<p>work. is statement displays Paul’s distinctive halakah or walk before </p>
<p>God that endeavors to conform disciples to the pattern of the gospel.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e metaphor of a walk before God was important in Jewish piety (e.g., </p>
<p>Exod 18:20; Deut 13:4–5; Ps 86:11) and in Paul’s exhortations elsewhere </p>
<p>(e.g., Gal 5:16; 2 Cor 5:7). e true test of knowledge is that it is noetically </p>
<p>enriching, spiritually maturing, conforms to God’s purpose, and results </p>
<p>in patterns of behavior that are honoring of the Lord. e fruits of such </p>
<p>knowledge speak for themselves: endurance and patience. e endur-</p>
<p>ance motif is particularly important in light of what Paul will say in Col </p>
<p>1:23 about continuing securely in the faith and not shiing from the hope </p>
<p>of the gospel. While God provides strength and power for the believer, </p>
<p>he or she is still required to seek God’s will and to honor God in order to </p>
<p>persevere and endure in the faith contained in the gospel.</p>
<p>Paul proceeds to call the Colossians to be full of thankfulness towards</p>
<p>God and accompanied with joy. e reason for this joy is that the Father </p>
<p>has qualied you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light. </p>
<p>e word hikanoō means to make sucient, adequate, or qualied (see 2 </p>
<p>Cor 3:6). Ironically, whereas the Father has qualied them, the Colossians </p>
<p>are giving ear to those who want to “disqualify” them (see 2:18). is is </p>
<p>similar to the language of “justication” insofar as God has bestowed a </p>
<p>special status on the Colossian believers that is complete, comprehensive, </p>
<p>and requires no supplementary addition achieved through tertiary rituals. </p>
<p>What the Father has qualied them for is more interesting. Inheritance </p>
<p>has an obvious background in the Old Testament, and the land was Israel’s </p>
<p>inheritance (e.g., Deut 26:1–2; Josh 11:23; Ps 105:11). However, in the </p>
<p>14. See also Phil 1:27: “live your life in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ.”</p>
