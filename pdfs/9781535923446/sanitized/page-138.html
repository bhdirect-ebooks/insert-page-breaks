<p>Colossians 4:7–18</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>to Ioustos.</p>

<p>ese three are described as coming from the circumcision,</p>
<p>which is most probably a designation for a Jew (Gal 2:8–9; Phil 3:3; Titus </p>
<p>1:10). ese are the only Jewish Christians among Paul’s fellow workers </p>
<p>and this remark might have a slight barb on the end of it to warn against </p>
<p>excessive fraternizing with local synagogues in Colossae. Christians in </p>
<p>Asia did not always receive the best response from Jewish communities </p>
<p>as evident from the riot over Paul in Ephesus (Acts 19:33–34) and the </p>
<p>scolding remarks in Revelation where Jews of Smyrna and Philadelphia </p>
<p>are called “a synagogue of Satan” (Rev 2:9; 3:9).</p>
<p>eir common work relates to the kingdom of God, which, despite </p>
<p>the paucity of its references in Paul’s letters compared to the Gospels, is </p>
<p>no less important. It has four primary spheres of meaning: (1) the power </p>
<p>of God which has invaded the present time through a display of powerful </p>
<p>deeds (1 Cor 4:20); (2) a term reecting the totality of the “now” experi-</p>
<p>ence of God’s salvic blessings (Rom 14:17; Col 1:13; cf. Acts 19:8; 20:25; </p>
<p>28:23, 31); (3) a future state that believers have been called into and can </p>
<p>expect to enter into unless they disqualify themselves with incessant im-</p>
<p>moral behavior (1 Cor 6:9–10; 15:50; Gal 5:21; Eph 5:5; 1 ess 2:12; 2 </p>
<p>ess 1:5; 2 Tim 4:1; cf. Acts 14:22); and (4) the manifestation of God’s </p>
<p>reign on earth at the parousia of Jesus the Messiah (1 Cor 15:24, 50–57; 2 </p>
<p>Tim 4:1, 18). e usage of kingdom here in 4:11 is clearly in line with 1:13 </p>
<p>where “kingdom” stands for the salvation of God revealed in the saving </p>
<p>reign of the Son.</p>
<p>A nal trio of coworkers is then mentioned as sending greetings. </p>
<p>First, Epaphras, whose qualities are lauded by Paul very much as a con-</p>
<p>tinuation from 1:7 where he was called a “beloved fellow slave” and “a </p>
<p>faithful servant of the Messiah.” Epaphras was probably the “evangelist” </p>
<p>and founding “pastor” of the churches of the Lycus Valley and now oper-</p>
<p>ates in Paul’s own immediate circle. He is called again a slave of Messiah </p>
<p>Jesus, which highlights the devoted nature of his service. Epaphras is </p>
<p>described as struggling for you in prayer, which not only highlights his </p>
<p>pastoral concern for the Colossians, but shows that he fullls the exhorta-</p>
<p>tion about devotion in prayer in 4:2. e purpose of his prayer is that they </p>
<p>stand mature and be fully assured in all of God’s will, and this prayer </p>
<p>reects the same goals that Paul has for his ministry in 1:28 and 2:2 about </p>
<p>5. Note the other gures with this name in Acts: Joseph called Barsabbas, “who was </p>
<p>know as Justus” (Acts 1:23), and “Titius Justus,” who was a God-fearer in Corinth (Acts </p>
<p>18:7).</p>
