<p>engaging the empty deceit Of a </p>
<p>mystic Judaism in a heLLenistic </p>
<p>phiLOsOphicaL garb (2:8–23)</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and</p>
<p>empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the </p>
<p>elemental forces of the cosmos and not according to Messiah. </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>For in him the fulness of deity dwells bodily,</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>and you have</p>
<p>been lled in him, who is the head of every ruler and author-</p>
<p>ity. </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision</p>
<p>done without human hands, in putting o the body of esh </p>
<p>in the circumcision of the Messiah. </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Having been buried</p>
<p>with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him </p>
<p>through faith in the operation of God, who raised him from </p>
<p>the dead. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>And you, who were dead in the trespasses and</p>
<p>the uncircumcision of your esh, God made you alive with </p>
<p>him, having forgiven us all of our trespasses, </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>having erased</p>
<p>the manuscript, with its decrees, which stood against us; he </p>
<p>took it from our midst, having nailed it to the cross. </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>He</p>
<p>disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to public </p>
<p>shame, triumphing over them in the cross.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>erefore, let no one judge you in matters of food and</p>
<p>drink or with regard to a feast or a New Moon or a Sabbath, </p>
<p>17</p>
<p> which are merely a shadow of what is to come, but the sub-</p>
<p>stance belongs to the Messiah. </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Let no one disqualify you,</p>
<p>insisting on ascetic practices and worship of angels, which </p>
<p>he has purportedly seen on entering (heaven), vainly being </p>
<p>pued up by his eshly mind, </p>
<p>19</p>
<p>and not grasping the head,</p>
<p>from whom the whole body is supplied and joined together </p>
<p>through its joints and ligaments, it grows with a growth that </p>
<p>is of God. </p>
<p>20</p>
<p>If you died with Messiah to the elemental forces</p>
