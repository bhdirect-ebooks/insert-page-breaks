<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>ere was a sizable Jewish population in the Lycus Valley. Seleucus </p>
<p>Nicator (ca. 358–281 BCE), the founder of the Seleucid kingdom encom-</p>
<p>passing Asia Minor, granted civic rights to the Jews in all the cities that </p>
<p>he founded and Antiochus II (ca. 286–46 BCE) planted Jewish colonists </p>
<p>in the cities of Ionia.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Antiochus III (ca. 241–187 BCE) settled some two</p>
<p>thousand Jewish families from Babylon and Mesopotamia in the regions </p>
<p>of Lydia and Phrygia, and Philo refers to the large population of Jews in </p>
<p>every city of Asia Minor.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Laodicea in particular was a collection point</p>
<p>for payment of the temple tax by Jews living in the region, and in 62 </p>
<p>BCE the proconsul of Asia Lucius Valerius Flaccus attempted to seize </p>
<p>the collection, which, according to Cicero, consisted of twenty pounds </p>
<p>of gold.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>If the temple tax was a half shekel or two drachmae, that could</p>
<p>represent a collection from Jewish males numbering as many as ten thou-</p>
<p>sand, though a slightly lower gure might be more cautious.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Like other</p>
<p>Anatolian cities, Colossae probably had a substantial Jewish population </p>
<p>(possibly between one and two thousand persons) and at least one syna-</p>
<p>gogue or prayer house. A number of Jewish sarcophagi in Hierapolis have </p>
<p>been collected together by Walter Ameling, indicating a sizable Jewish </p>
<p>presence in the Lycus Valley.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Hierapolis and Laodicea suered extensive</p>
<p>damage from an earthquake that shook the region in the early 60s CE </p>
<p>and we can safely assume that Colossae suered the same fate. Laodicea </p>
<p>was rebuilt using funds from within the city, but we do not know what </p>
<p>happened to Colossae or if it survived the earthquake or not.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>ere is</p>
<p>no evidence of habitation in Colossae aer 63–64 CE until coins reappear </p>
<p>in the late second century.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Colossae has never been excavated; however, excavations are </p>
<p>planned in a joint project directed by Flinders University (Australia) and </p>
<p>Pamukkale University (Turkey).</p>

<p>We can anxiously await the results since</p>

<p>towns in the Lycus Valley were destroyed. Strabo (Geogr. 12.8.16) wrote that the entire </p>
<p>region was known as a centre of repeated catastrophes.</p>
