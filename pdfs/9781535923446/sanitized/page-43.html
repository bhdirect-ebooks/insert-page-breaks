<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>that Philemon might never receive Onesimus back at all (v. 15). Did </p>
<p>Philemon or Archippus think that by sending Onesimus to Paul on an </p>
<p>errand or with supplies that they were thereby running the risk of never </p>
<p>seeing him again? I would doubt it.</p>
<p>(c) e rst option, the view that Onesimus was a runaway slave, </p>
<p>explains the language of being “separated” (v. 15), “wronged,” and “owed” </p>
<p>(v. 18). e reference to “as a slave” is probably real (v. 16); that Paul needs </p>
<p>Philemon’s consent before enlisting Onesimus among his cohort of co-</p>
<p>workers implies a slave-master relationship between the two (vv. 13–14). </p>
<p>Yet this view lacks the expected references to fugitive status, there is no </p>
<p>mention of the severity of punishment that could await a runaway slave, </p>
<p>it begs the question of why Onesimus went to Paul at all rather than van-</p>
<p>ish entirely, and nally, no explicit circumstance for Onesimus’s ight is </p>
<p>given, which must give cause for thought.</p>
<p>(d) I conclude that the second option is the most probable, and </p>
<p>that Onesimus journeyed to Ephesus from Colossae to have Paul me-</p>
<p>diate between him and his master over some matter that is now public </p>
<p>before the Colossian church. Onesimus has become a believer as a result </p>
<p>of the encounter, which, in tandem with Paul’s religious authority, adds </p>
<p>further reason for Philemon to respond favorably to Onesimus and to </p>
<p>heed Paul’s request. e urgent qualication that needs to be made here </p>
<p>is that Philemon’s perception of Onesimus’s absence may not accord with </p>
<p>Onesimus’s actual intentions in going to Paul. e technical legal distinc-</p>
<p>tion between a runaway slave and a slave absent from duty and absconded </p>
<p>to his master’s superior, may not exist in the mind of an irate slave owner.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Either way, Paul agrees to be an advocate for Onesimus to Philemon in </p>
<p>order to eect reconciliation between them and to secure a better future </p>
<p>for them beyond the normal slave-master relationship.</p>
<p>Paul and Slavery</p>
<p>More sensitively we have to ask: did Paul endorse slavery or was he at least </p>
<p>complicit to its continuing operation?</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> e mere mention of slavery con-</p>
<p>jures up feelings and thoughts that are so clearly an aront to our modern </p>
<p>96. Cf. further Barclay 1996: 101–2; Harrill 1999.</p>
<p>97. On slavery in the New Testament and antiquity see Guzlow 1969; Keener 1992: </p>
<p>188–207; Barth and Blanke 2000: 1–102; Harrill 2005; and the history of interpretation </p>
<p>of Paul and slavery in Byron 2008.</p>
