<p>Colossians 2:8–23</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>salvation is to return to an obsolete and even oppressive situation (see </p>
<p>Rom 10:4; Gal 3:1–5).</p>
<p>e thrust of Paul’s argument is that the true meaning of the Colossian </p>
<p>believers’ identication with the Messiah is freedom from the exact kinds </p>
<p>of practices being foisted upon them. What is more, the philosophy does </p>
<p>not deliver on what it promises; its rituals, regulations, and esoteric ex-</p>
<p>periences are ineective. e philosophy does not enhance their standing </p>
<p>and prestige before God, but rather hinders it. Its claims have a human </p>
<p>rather than heavenly origin. e various proscriptions of the teachers </p>
<p>derive from a false and manufactured piety. e vision reports are self-in-</p>
<p>ationary, not revelatory or edifying. Even worse, the philosophy results </p>
<p>in a secondary submission to malevolent forces aer the Messiah has </p>
<p>already released believers from bondage. is critique comes through an </p>
<p>interweaving of Christology, eschatology, and cosmology, where Paul sets </p>
<p>up the Messiah as a type of master of the universe who has emancipated </p>
<p>an annexed territory and freed the inhabitants from the decrees of their </p>
<p>former overlords.</p>
<p>e section is structured around reference to the claims of the teach-</p>
<p>ers in Colossae and the counterclaims of Paul in regards to the futility of </p>
<p>the philosophy and the fullness of the Messiah (2:8–15). He then admixes </p>
<p>some exhortatory comments with three major prohibitions that result in </p>
<p>behavior that moves them away from the philosophy and back towards an </p>
<p>ethical paradigm more in line with the gospel (2:16–23). In many ways, </p>
<p>it is an extension of the propositio set forth in 1:15–20 concerning the </p>
<p>suciency of supremacy of the Messiah.</p>
<p>The Colossian Philosophy as Captivity </p>
<p>and the Work of Messiah as Conquest (2:8–15)</p>
<p>Paul commences his exhortation with regards to the philosophy</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>more</p>
<p>directly, and both segments of his thought (2:8, 16) begin with injunctions </p>
<p>that no one (mē tis)</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>pressure them into certain behaviors or attitudes</p>
<p>1. Many things could pass as a philosophy in the ancient world, including certain </p>
<p>schools of philosophy (Platonism, Stoicism, Pythagoreanism, Cynicism, etc.), religions </p>
<p>such as Judaism, the study of magic, and mystery religions. It is probable that philosophy </p>
<p>represents the teachers’ own designation of their body of teachings and way of life.</p>
<p>2. Paul can oen refer to his opponents obliquely as “some,” “certain men,” or “those” </p>
<p>(Rom 3:8; 1 Cor 4:18; 15:12, 34; 2 Cor 3:1; 10:2; Gal 1:7; 2:12; Phil 1:15). But one should </p>
