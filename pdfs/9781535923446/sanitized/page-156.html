<p>Philemon 8–22</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>sharing in one another’s aairs in the cause of Jesus Christ. On the one </p>
<p>hand, this is an impassioned plea for Philemon to embrace Onesimus </p>
<p>as he would Paul, but in another sense it is a gently worded ultimatum </p>
<p>to the eect that “if you do not receive him then you do not really have </p>
<p>fellowship with me.” In the second conditional clause, Paul expresses his </p>
<p>willingness to cover any debts incurred by Onesimus’s departure: If he </p>
<p>has wronged you, or owes you anything, charge that to me. Paul is will-</p>
<p>ing to become Philemon’s debtor in order to eect reconciliation between </p>
<p>the two. It might have been some nancial misappropriation, incompe-</p>
<p>tency, or outright the that marked the occasion of Onesimus’s ight to </p>
<p>Paul. Paul here says he is willing to pay the debt. He then interjects a very </p>
<p>personal remark that I, Paul, write this with my own hand, and in eect </p>
<p>turns his letter into a promissory note. He emphasizes his willingness to </p>
<p>cover any debt with I will repay it, underscoring the nancial injury suf-</p>
<p>fered to Philemon once more. But the apostle adds, to say nothing of you </p>
<p>owing me your very own self, which turns Philemon from a creditor into </p>
<p>a debtor in the space of two mere verses. e rhetorical function here </p>
<p>is of a paralipsis, when a speaker/author asserts that he is passing over </p>
<p>something that actually needs to be mentioned. is debt of Philemon </p>
<p>to Paul was probably incurred during Philemon’s coming to faith. Maybe </p>
<p>Paul even “begat” Philemon in much the same way that he has begat </p>
<p>Onesimus; in which case Philemon and Onesimus are brothers through </p>
<p>having the same spiritual father. is indebtedness to Paul eectively can-</p>
<p>cels out anything that Onesimus owes Philemon, rendering Paul’s oer </p>
<p>to nancially compensate Philemon as rhetorical. Philemon’s indebted-</p>
<p>ness is emphasized further as Paul says, Yes, brother, I want some benet </p>
<p>from you in the Lord. While the aection for Philemon is retained, it </p>
<p>is with the implicit qualication that he remains indebted to Paul and </p>
<p>should oer up something for Paul’s own advantage. Paul was not a so-</p>
<p>cial equal to Philemon in the material sense (he owned no property or </p>
<p>slaves), but he has nevertheless become Philemon’s patron by bringing </p>
<p>him the message of salvation. Another play on words is apparent with </p>
<p>benet (oninēmi) which sounds close to “Onesimus.” Paul would like to </p>
<p>“benet” by Philemon as Philemon “benets” from Onesimus. Philemon, </p>
<p>as the client here, is indebted to enhance the honor, advantage, and repu-</p>
<p>tation of his patron and Paul details how. e phrase Renew my heart in </p>
<p>Messiah harks back to v. 7 where Philemon had reportedly comforted the </p>
<p>hearts of the saints in the past and Paul seeks a similar consolation from </p>
