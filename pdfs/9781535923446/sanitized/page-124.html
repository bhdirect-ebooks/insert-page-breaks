<p>Fusing the Horizons: Doctrine and Life</p>
<p>Paul has complimented the Colossians on their growth in so far as that he has </p>
<p>heard of their love for all the saints (1:4). What he calls them now to do is to </p>
<p>reﬂect that love in action, in behavior, and in attitudes that appropriately reﬂect </p>
<p>a life worthy of the Lord (1:10). In that sense, he prosecutes the integration </p>
<p>of doctrine and life and weaves them together throughout this section. The </p>
<p>two are inseparable for Paul as an out working of the gospel. Adolf Schlatter </p>
<p>pointed out that for Paul the Denkakt (thought-act) and the Lebensakt (life-</p>
act) cannot be divorced from each other. For Paul, one’s thought life and
<p>practical life are necessarily intertwined.</p>

<p>There is no room to accommodate</p>
<p>a dry cerebral faith that does not issue forth in action, and there is no place for </p>
<p>a Christian lifestyle that is not at once rooted in theological reﬂection of the </p>
<p>gospel. As the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard once said, “As you have </p>
<p>lived so have you believed.” What ultimately expresses one’s true beliefs is not </p>
<p>words or statements, but actions (see Jas 2:1–26; 1 John 3:18). Paul does </p>
<p>not issue a call for the Colossians to apply his moral philosophy with more </p>
<p>stringent rigor or to cultivate the noble virtues as ends in and of themselves. </p>
<p>Paul wants the churches of the Lycus Valley to reﬂect and conform to the </p>
<p>power of the new age that is now at work in them through Jesus Christ. Paul </p>
<p>wants them to understand themselves as being in-Messiah and to live and </p>
<p>love accordingly. We might say that Paul pleads with them not to play CDs on </p>
<p>the turntable of a record player since new technology should not be played on </p>
<p>old and outdated equipment. That attitude is exempliﬁed in the call to put </p>
<p>certain behaviors to death. Biologist E. O. Wilson noticed that colonies of ants </p>
<p>communicated through a complex system of chemical pheromones that can </p>
<p>indicate certain states such as danger, hunger, mating, and even death. Ants </p>
<p>that emitted the pheromone of death were carried away from the nest. Wilson </p>
<p>decided to experiment and see what would happen if a fully functional ant </p>
<p>was sprayed with the death pheromone. He found that the death-smelling ant, </p>
