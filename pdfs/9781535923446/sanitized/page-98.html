<p>Colossians 2:16–23</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>matters pertaining to food designate the Jewish laws detailing clean and </p>
<p>unclean foods (Lev 11:1–23; Deut 14:3–21). Adherence to the food laws </p>
<p>was a matter of purity and election since they kept the Israelites separate </p>
<p>from the other nations and preserved their capacity to worship God in </p>
<p>a state of ritual purity. Adherence to the food laws was a key indicator </p>
<p>of loyalty to the covenant especially during the Hellenistic period when </p>
<p>Hellenism was being violently thrust upon Judeans in the second century </p>
<p>BCE (1 Macc 1:62–63; Tob 1:10–12; Jdt 12:2, 19; Jos. Asen. 7:1; 8:5). e </p>
<p>Jewish dietary practices publicized Jewish distinctiveness, and Jewish re-</p>
<p>fusal to dine with non-Jews was regarded as antisocial by some ancient </p>
<p>authors (Acts 10:28; 11:3; Tacitus Hist. 5.5; Josephus Ag. Ap. 2.148, 258; </p>
<p>Philostratus Vit. Apoll. 5.33). It is unsurprising, then, that given the Jewish </p>
<p>context of early Christianity, the major debates in the early church were </p>
<p>over food and fellowship (see Gal 2:11–14; Acts 10:14; Rom 14; 1 Cor </p>
<p>8). Abstention from drink probably concerns wine consumed as part of </p>
<p>libations to the gods, which meant that it was contaminated by idolatry </p>
<p>(Dan 1:3–16; 10:3; Add Esth 14:17; Jos. Asen. 8:5; m. ‘Abod. Zar. 2:3; 5:2; </p>
<p>cf. 1 Cor 10:31; Rom 14:17), or else because liquids were thought to be </p>
<p>susceptible to impurity (e.g., CD 12:15–17; m. Ber. 8:2). e feast could </p>
<p>designate Jewish festivals such as Passover, Tabernacles, or Pentecost. </p>
<p>e New Moon is slightly more ambiguous as it was deemed to have sig-</p>
<p>nicance for a number of religious groups and philosophies, but given </p>
<p>what precedes a connection with the Jewish cultus is most likely (Num </p>
<p>10:10; 2 Kgs 4:23; Ps 81:3; Isa 1:13; Ezek 46:3, 6). We seem to have here </p>
<p>fairly denitive evidence for the Jewish nature of the philosophy since, </p>
<p>socially speaking, it required the observance of customs that demarcated </p>
<p>the Jewish people in a pagan environment. e underlying assumption </p>
<p>is that the Colossians were judged for failing to obey regulations binding </p>
<p>upon them, even as Gentiles, if they do not adhere to Jewish practices </p>
<p>pertaining to purity laws, Sabbath, and festivals. e implication is that </p>
<p>the teachers advocated (partial) adherence to the Torah provides fulness </p>
<p>and fullment lacking in the Christian message.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>e rationale for rejecting the imposition of these Jewish regulations </p>
<p>is that they are merely a shadow of what is to come. Similar language is </p>
<p>used in Heb 10:1 to describe the Old Testament in relation to Christ. is </p>
<p>idea draws on the Platonic understanding of the dierence between ideal </p>
<p>30. As such I reject the view of DeMaris 1994: 51 that there is no polemic against the </p>
<p>Mosaic law in Colossians.</p>
