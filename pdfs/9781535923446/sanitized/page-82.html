<p>of glory. e you most probably describes Gentiles who have entered into </p>
<p>the citizenship of Israel.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Clearly the fulcrum of the mystery is the person</p>
<p>and work of Jesus, so that the glory that was lost at the fall of the old </p>
<p>creation is regained through the new Adam and bestowed upon partici-</p>
<p>pants in the new creation. Humanity is recongured and renewed into its </p>
<p>former glorious Edenic state in the Messiah. Polemically put, the mystery </p>
<p>of God is made known through the gospel of the Messiah and not in the </p>
<p>intellectual structures of Judaism, Hellenistic philosophy, Jewish magic, </p>
<p>or in the esoteric revelations reported by mystics (Col 2:18). In contrast </p>
<p>to the teachers, the mystery of heaven is not found in visionary ascents to </p>
<p>the heavenly throne, but it consists in the life of heaven coming down and </p>
<p>falling upon Jews and Gentiles through the indwelling of the Messiah.</p>
<p>Missionary Struggles and the Mystery of the Messiah </p>
<p>(1:28—2:3)</p>
<p>Part of Paul’s strategy to commend their continued obedience to the </p>
<p>gospel is to show the Colossians how they belong to a wider network of </p>
<p>churches spread across the world, and that the most glorious mysteries of </p>
<p>the universe have been given to them in Jesus the Messiah. e universal-</p>
<p>ity of the Pauline mission is emphasized by all people (panta anthrōpon), </p>
<p>which is repeated three times. Emphasis falls upon the medium and intent </p>
<p>of Paul’s teaching ministry and that of his coworkers (hence the switch to </p>
<p>the plural we).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> is includes proclaiming him, evangelistic activity fo-</p>
<p>cused on Jesus; admonishing, understood as warning or correction; and </p>
<p>teaching, as imparted learning in the way of Jesus. ese eorts result </p>
<p>in people being mature in Messiah. Persons who are gospelized in this </p>
<p>way attain the full maturity of spiritual renewal that comes from living </p>
<p>in the purposes of God (see Col 4:12; Eph 4:13). is maturing is tanta-</p>
<p>mount to being conformed to the image of God’s Son (Rom 8:29; 2 Cor </p>
<p>3:18) and the new self being renewed according to the image of its creator </p>
<p>(Col 3:10).</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> Such maturation or perfection comes through the preced-</p>
<p>15. Cf. Lohse 1971: 76; Wolter 1993: 105; Bockmuehl 1990: 182.</p>
<p>16. is universality clearly stands over and against the philosophy of the Colossian </p>
<p>teachers. See Lightfoot 1879: 168; Abbott 1897: 235; Bruce 1957: 219; Sappington </p>
<p>1991: 186.</p>
<p>17. Alternatively, present mature may refer to the parousia and how Paul hopes that </p>
<p>the Colossians will be “blameless” on the day of Christ Jesus. See O’Brien 1982: 89–90.</p>
