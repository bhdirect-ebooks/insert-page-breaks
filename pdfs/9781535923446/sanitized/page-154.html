<p>occupy the oce of deacon (Acts 6:2; Rom 16:1; 1 Tim 3:10, 13; though </p>
<p>this is perhaps unlikely for a new convert). Given Onesimus’s travels, the </p>
<p>rst option of acting as Paul’s messenger or delegate is probably in mind </p>
<p>and Onesimus is groomed to be one of Paul’s many emissaries.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Paul</p>
<p>presumes upon an obligation by Philemon to render service, a service </p>
<p>that may be vicariously performed by Onesimus in Philemon’s place. is </p>
<p>service is not rendered only to Paul but to the cause of the gospel for </p>
<p>which Paul is imprisoned. Paul goes on to restate the same point, only </p>
<p>dierently, by referring to his unwillingness to retain Onesimus in his </p>
<p>service without Philemon’s consent. e reason for not presuming upon </p>
<p>Philemon’s compliance to Paul’s request is so that your goodness might </p>
<p>not be by compulsion but of your own free decision. is goodness ob-</p>
<p>viously implies Philemon either giving him a slave for free or, more likely, </p>
<p>manumitting Onesimus so that he can serve as a freedman as part of </p>
<p>Paul’s circle of co-workers. Such goodness would be an obvious example </p>
<p>of the “sharing of your faith” as referred to in v. 6.</p>
<p>Paul moves to intercede directly to Philemon for Onesimus and en-</p>
<p>gages the matter of their estrangement. Paul acts here as a “friend of the </p>
<p>master” and seeks to achieve a reconciliation that arms that Onesimus </p>
<p>had done wrong but is forgivable. Paul consciously tries to maintain </p>
<p>Philemon’s honor and reputation in resolving the matter and keep an </p>
<p>amicable relationship between himself and Philemon as well. In hind-</p>
<p>sight, the reason for which Onesimus was separated from Philemon was </p>
<p>so that Onesimus could perform a ministry for Paul in Philemon’s stead. </p>
<p>e details behind the separation are not stated, perhaps to avoid embar-</p>
<p>rassing Onesimus further and to refrain from reminding Philemon of his </p>
<p>loss. While the separation was temporary the return would be perma-</p>
<p>nent since Onesimus has become one of Paul’s spiritual children. What </p>
<p>is more, on return Onesimus should be received no longer as a slave but </p>
<p>more than a slave, as a beloved brother. is is the clearest point at which </p>
<p>Onesimus’s status as a slave is expressed, and the phrase more than a slave </p>
<p>suggests that his servitude to Philemon is literal rather than metaphorical. </p>
<p>e willing return of Onesimus means that he can be received as a dear </p>
<p>brother, that is, within the ctive kinship of the Christian movement where </p>
<p>brotherly love extends to those who have no grounds for fraternal bonds </p>
<p>other than that which unites them under the lordship of Jesus. Although </p>
