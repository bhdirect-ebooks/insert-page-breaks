<p>Engaging the Empty Deceit of Mystic Judaism</p>

<p>of the cosmos, why, as if you were living in the world, do you </p>
<p>continue to submit to its regulations? </p>
<p>21</p>
<p>“Do not handle do</p>
<p>not taste, do not touch” </p>
<p>22</p>
<p>(which marks all things which</p>
<p>perish as they are used up), according to the commandments </p>
<p>and teachings of men? </p>
<p>23</p>
<p>ese indeed have an appearance of</p>
<p>wisdom in promoting pseudo-piety and ascetic practices and </p>
<p>harsh treatment of the body, but they are not of any value in </p>
<p>restraining the gratication of the esh.</p>
<p>In this section we come to the hub of Paul’s attack on the philosophy. To </p>
<p>an audience listening to the letter read out aloud, 2:8–23 would sound like </p>
<p>the refutatio of a deliberative discourse by striking up arguments against </p>
<p>an opposing viewpoint. Paul engages the philosophy of the teachers in </p>
<p>Colossae in this unit, and his critique, especially its language and back-</p>
<p>ground, bears a semblance to his earlier critique of worldly philosophy </p>
<p>in 1 Corinthians and his attack on Judeo-Christian nomism in Galatians. </p>
<p>Paul is not simply rehearsing older debates, nor are the issues faced in </p>
<p>Colossae identical to those in Corinth or Galatia. More likely, Paul and </p>
<p>his coworkers draw on a repertoire of debates and polemics from earlier </p>
<p>episodes to combat a perceived encroachment upon a Gentile Christian </p>
<p>community in Colossae. In 2:8, Paul clearly sets up a contrast of philosophy, </p>
<p>human tradition, and elemental forces on the one hand and the Messiah </p>
<p>on the other hand. e Messiah is emphasized as a gure who embodies </p>
<p>deity, transforms persons through an inner circumcision symbolized by </p>
<p>baptism, cancels the condemnatory regulations of the Torah, and defeats </p>
<p>hostile spiritual powers through his cross. In contrast, the philosophy is </p>
<p>associated with submission to malevolent powers, the manuscript with </p>
<p>its decrees, needlessly harsh ascetic practices, the worship of/with angels, </p>
<p>adhering to various prohibitions pertaining to cultic matters, accepting </p>
<p>claims of wisdom, listening to reports of visions, and restraining eshly </p>
<p>desires through mistreatment of the body. As stated in the introduction, </p>
<p>the philosophy clearly has a Jewish avor, with references to circumcision, </p>
<p>New Moon festivals, and Sabbath keeping. All features of the philosophy </p>
<p>can be paralleled in Jewish beliefs and practices of the Second Temple </p>
<p>period. For Paul, the goal of the Torah has reached its completion in Jesus, </p>
<p>so that to turn to the Torah for the basis of their identity, way of life, or </p>
