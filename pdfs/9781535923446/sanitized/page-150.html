<p>Philemon 1–7</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>Christians towards their brothers and sisters in the faith.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>In other words,</p>
<p>Paul lauds (and will appeal) to an identical benevolence in Philemon. A </p>
<p>further reason for Paul’s thanksgiving is that Philemon’s love for the saints </p>
<p>occasions Paul’s joy and comfort. is extends not only to Paul but to </p>
<p>other saints (i.e., those of Paul’s circle who know of Philemon, such as </p>
<p>Epaphras) who have been refreshed by Philemon. e connotation here </p>
<p>is of relief from toil and frustration through assistance. Once more the </p>
<p>compliment implies a question. Philemon has been a means of comfort </p>
<p>and consolation to others before; on the issue relating to Onesimus, will </p>
<p>he be so again?</p>
<p>6. Cf. Lohse 1971: 194; and CSB, who opt for “the glory of Christ.”</p>
