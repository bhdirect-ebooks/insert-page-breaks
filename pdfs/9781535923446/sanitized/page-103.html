<p>Engaging the Empty Deceit of Mystic Judaism</p>

<p>solves the Adamic condition of humanity (see Rom 5:20).</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>Of course, as</p>
<p>Paul addresses in Roman 6 and Galatians 5, if obedience to Torah and its </p>
<p>various commandments is no longer the denitive charter and code of </p>
<p>conduct for God’s people, then how does one prevent converted pagans </p>
<p>from reverting back to their old idolatrous and immoral ways? e answer </p>
<p>is not by imposing Torah on them; rather, it is the teaching of Jesus, the </p>
<p>example of Jesus, and life in the Spirit.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>ese remarks might seem like</p>
<p>terse comments about freedom from certain rules, but they go far beyond </p>
<p>that. It is about the goodness and grace of the body. Debates about the </p>
<p>body, escaping it or beating it into submission, are the tip of the iceberg </p>
<p>for theological debates about the nature of creation and salvation.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Common Faith</p>
<p>The new covenant community has always been a creedal community confess-</p>
<p>ing its faith as to what God has done in creation, in the history of Israel, in </p>
<p>Jesus, and in the life of the church. The triune God has made himself known </p>
<p>in his acts of reconciliation and renewal, and this ﬁlls the content of sermons, </p>
<p>Bible studies, liturgies, songs, prayers, creeds, and confessions from ancient </p>
<p>times until even now. For this reason, the early church developed creeds as </p>
<p>short programmatic summaries of its faith. These creeds enabled the church </p>
<p>to know its own mind and to state how it distinguished itself from Judaism </p>
<p>and paganism and from unwholesome derivations of its own beliefs. While </p>
<p>no one likes people who are doctrinaire and unduly infatuated with doctrinal </p>
<p>precision over every minor issue, nonetheless, we cannot help but notice that </p>
<p>the content of faith matters immensely. A common faith is what ultimately </p>
<p>deﬁnes the center and boundaries of the church and even forms the fulcrum </p>
<p>of our common fellowship.</p>
<p>It is vitally important, then, that the church in all ages guard its theo-</p>
<p>logical vision of the nature of God, Christ, and salvation without being point-</p>
<p>lessly puritanical or vacuously broad. Even though it might seem unpopular, </p>
<p>we should maintain the language of “heresy” and warnings against it. Since </p>
<p>perversions of our distinct theological vision can endanger the integrity of our </p>
