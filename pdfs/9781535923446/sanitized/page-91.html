<p>Engaging the Empty Deceit of Mystic Judaism</p>

<p>mix of angel veneration and asceticism.</p>

<p>In 2:20, then, Paul asserts that</p>
<p>dying with the Messiah releases believers from the grip of these forces </p>
<p>and their prescribed practices. ird, the philosophy is not according to </p>
<p>Messiah, which is to say that it does not correspond with the teaching </p>
<p>about the Messiah received by the Colossians that is dened elsewhere as </p>
<p>the “word of Messiah” (3:16) or “the faith” (1:23; 2:7).</p>
<p>Paul proceeds to justify the superiority of the Messiah to the phi-</p>
<p>losophy in a number of ways. To begin with, he states that in him the </p>
<p>fulness of deity dwells bodily, which should be taken as a reference to the </p>
<p>incarnation.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>e adverb bodily (sōmatikōs) indicates the mechanism</p>
<p>through which God dwells in the Messiah. Paul emphasizes the body of </p>
<p>the Messiah by referring to his bodily death (1:22), bodily resurrection </p>
<p>(2:11–12), and bodily exaltation (3:1).</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>No angelic gure measures up</p>
<p>to him as he is identied in a unique and absolute way with the God of </p>
the universe. Access to the divine realm is not attained through a philo-
<p>sophically savvy spin on Judaism with angelic furnishings, but through </p>
<p>the God-in-Christ event, whereby the body of the Messiah becomes the </p>
<p>very locus of God’s holy presence and saving activity. us, Jesus is not </p>
<p>merely another cosmic aeon or angelic intermediary, but the self-revela-</p>
<p>tion of God in human form. If we read 2:9 in light of 1:15–20, it means </p>
that the divine nature did not dwell in Jesus only aer his resurrection,
<p>but resided in the one in whom the cosmic powers were created and in </p>
<p>whom the whole universe nds coherence.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Accordingly, solidarity with</p>
the Messiah means participation in the divine life and the divine power of
<p>creation and new creation that is embodied in him.</p>
<p>Paul turns and says that the Colossians have been lled in him, </p>
<p>specifying not what they are lled with, but in whom they are lled. e </p>
<p>chief thought is of fulllment or completion of communion with God </p>
<p>by union with the Messiah. e same one who is the embodiment of the </p>
divine presence is also sovereign over every ruler and authority. ese
<p>entities occur here in the singular, whereas they are used in the plural </p>
<p>elsewhere (i.e., rulers and authorities in 1:16; 2:15), but little can be made </p>
<p>of that distinction. e main point, as in the Christ Hymn, is that Jesus is </p>
