<p>the supremacy Of messiah in </p>
<p>creatiOn and recOnciLiatiOn: </p>
<p>The Christ Hymn (1:15–20)</p>
<p>e most frequently cited and studied part of Colossians is the Christ </p>
<p>Hymn of 1:15–20. Here (together with Phil 2:4–11; John 1:1–18; and Heb </p>
<p>1:1–4) we have one of the most sublime and profound descriptions of the </p>
<p>person and work of Jesus Christ in the New Testament. e scholarship </p>
<p>on this short piece of text is immense and nearly everything about the </p>
<p>passage is disputed.</p>

<p>15</p>
<p> He is the image of the invisible God</p>
<p> the rstborn of all of creation</p>
<p> </p>
<p>16</p>
<p> because in him were created</p>
<p> all things in the heavens and upon the earth</p>
<p> the visible and the invisible</p>
<p> whether thrones or lords or rulers or authorities</p>
<p> all things were created through him and for him.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> And he is before all things</p>
<p> and all things are sustained in him.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> And he is the head</p>
<p> of the body, the church.</p>
<p>He is the beginning</p>
<p>the rstborn from the dead in order that in all things he might have</p>
<p>preeminence</p>
<p> </p>
<p>19</p>
<p> because in him [God] was pleased to have all his fullness dwell</p>
<p> </p>
<p>20</p>
<p> and through him to reconcile to himself all things</p>
<p> by making peace through the blood of his cross through him</p>
<p> whether upon the earth or in the heavens</p>
