<p>e Supremacy of Messiah in Creation and Reconciliation</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>Jesus is closer to the role of creator and is not part of the created order. </p>
<p>What is more, there is no known reference to the world being created for </p>
<p>Wisdom.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ird, others argue that the poem represents a christological inter-</p>
<p>pretation of Genesis 1 and the language of “image” and “beginning” nds </p>
<p>suitable parallels there.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>C. F. Burney proposes that the poem understands</p>
<p>the gure of Wisdom in Prov 8:22 in light of Gen 1:1.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>He makes much of</p>
<p>the Hebrew compound word bereshith (“in the beginning”) in highlight-</p>
ing the instrument of divine agency in creation. Overall, I nd this third
<p>option the most likely. e poem is evidently rooted in the Jewish frame-</p>
<p>work of monotheism, creation, and intermediaries with clear echoes of </p>
<p>Gen 1:1, 26–27. As such, Jesus is the “image” of the new eschatological </p>
<p>humanity and the “beginning” of the new creation. ough I admit that </p>
<p>links with wisdom traditions are simply too plain to ignore.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>I suggest,</p>
<p>then, that it is precisely because Jewish wisdom theology was so indebted </p>
<p>to Jewish views of creation that links between Col 1:15–20 and Sirach, </p>
<p>Proverbs, Philo, and Wisdom of Solomon can be found.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> e most analo-</p>
<p>gous text, however, is probably 1 Cor 8:6. Taken together, 1 Cor 8:6 and </p>
<p>Col 1:15–20 provide an armation of a Jewish creation scheme, Jewish </p>
<p>monotheism, and God’s action through intermediaries. Yet this well-</p>
<p>5. See the thorough critique in Fee 2007: 317–25.</p>

<p>8. (1) In Gen 1:1 lxx, archē (“beginning”) is a translation of the Hebrew reshith (Col </p>
<p>1:18); (2) reshith is a polysemous word and can mean “beginning,” “rst-born,” “chief,” </p>
<p>and “head” (Col 1:15, 18); (3) the preposition be (“in, with, by”) in bereshith might corre-</p>
<p>spond to the prepositional clauses “in him,” “through him,” and “for him” (= Col 1:16–17, </p>
<p>19–20); (4) in the lxx eikōn (“image”) occurs in Gen 1:26–27 for Adam (Col 1:15); (5) </p>
<p>in terms of links with Jewish Hellenistic wisdom traditions we should note that Wisdom </p>
<p>is among the rst things created in the “beginning” (Prov 8:22–23; cf. Sir 1:4, 9; 24:9), </p>
<p>Wisdom is the “image” of Gods goodness (Wis 7:26), elsewhere “all things were made in </p>
<p>wisdom” (Ps 103:24 lxx; cf. Wis 8:5; 9:1–2; Prov 3:19; Philo Det. 54), Philo calls Wisdom </p>
<p>the “beginning and image and sight of God” (Leg. 1.43) and the Logos is “the beginning </p>
<p>and name of God, and the Word, and man according to God’s image, and he who sees </p>
<p>Israel” (Conf. 146). According to Smith (2006: 161), “It can be concluded that eikōn tou </p>
<p>theou is reective of a Jewish tradition of an anthropomorphous hypostatic representa-</p>
<p>tion of God.”</p>
<p>9. For a combination of both Old Testament imagery and Jewish Hellenistic wisdom </p>
<p>traditions see Dahl 1964: 434; O’Brien 1982: 38–40, 43–44, 61–62. Beale (2007: 855) also </p>
<p>shows that wisdom and adamic traditions are not mutually exclusive.</p>
