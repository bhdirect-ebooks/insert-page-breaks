<p>Letter Opening, Greeting, and anksgiving</p>

<p>and as an owner of slaves he would most likely have a dwelling capable of </p>
<p>hosting several persons. Christians met in a variety of places and settings </p>
<p>(outdoors, rented rooms, shops, etc.). House churches were common if a </p>
<p>congregational member had a suitable space available for use in prayer, </p>
<p>Scripture reading, and shared meals. e church that meets in Philemon’s </p>
<p>house remains on the periphery of the letter as Philemon’s response to </p>
<p>Paul is to be played out before them. Paul deliberately draws in the con-</p>
<p>gregation as a whole in order to make them stakeholders in the outcome </p>
<p>of his request.</p>
<p>Paul includes his customary grace and prayerful thanksgiving for </p>
<p>Philemon. Special themes here are faith(fulness), the saints, joy, comfort, </p>
<p>and refreshment, which will all appear again in the letter. e reason for </p>
<p>Paul’s thanksgiving is Philemon’s love and faithfulness for the Lord Jesus </p>
<p>and to all the saints. Indeed, Paul intends to appeal to Philemon to love </p>
<p>Onesimus as a brother and to obey Paul’s request out of gratitude to him. </p>
<p>Paul also prays that the sharing of your faith may become eective in the </p>
<p>full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Messiah. </p>
<p>is sharing refers to an overow of goodness and kindness, much like </p>
<p>a faith-in-action-through-love exhibited towards other believers (see Gal </p>
<p>5:6; 6:6; 1 ess 5:15; Rom 15:2). Paul prays that other Christians, not </p>
<p>least himself, participate in the good expression of Philemon’s faith. It is </p>
<p>both a prayer of thanks and a plea for continued generosity by Philemon. </p>
<p>is sharing becomes eective through the fullness of knowledge. at </p>
<p>knowledge pertains to how the good that Christians do benets other </p>
<p>Christians and thus Christ himself. Charles Moule notes that “good” is </p>
<p>ordinarily mentioned by Paul as something that is done or performed </p>
<p>rather than the object of knowledge.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>e good thing in question then</p>
<p>is the good conduct that accompanies the sharing of one’s faith, which </p>
<p>springs out of the abundant goodness that one has already received. Put </p>
<p>simply, out of the abundance of good things that Philemon has received </p>
<p>through the Lord Jesus he is now to display goodness to others. e </p>
<p>prepositional phrase for the sake of Messiah is ambiguous (lit. “into/</p>
<p>for Messiah”; contrast “that we may do for Christ” [nrsv]; “every good </p>
<p>thing we have in Christ” [niv]; “all the good we can do for Christ” [njb]). </p>
<p>e preposition eis is probably purposive and suggests that the values </p>
<p>embodied by the Messiah are upheld and honored in the benevolence of </p>
<p>5. Moule 1957: 143.</p>
