<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>later disciple of Paul theologically inferred from Paul’s writings een </p>
<p>years aer his death might not be any dierent to what Paul and his co-</p>
<p>workers inferred themselves while writing to believers from a position of </p>
<p>captivity that naturally gave over to exercises of reection.</p>
<p>ere is of course no getting away from the valid perception that </p>
<p>Colossians does sound a little dierent from, say, Galatians and First </p>
<p>essalonians in language. Colossians develops motifs which, though </p>
<p>genuinely Pauline, are emphasized and explored in new ways. What are </p>
<p>we to make of this then? James Dunn regards Colossians as a “bridge” </p>
<p>between the Pauline and post-Pauline periods and contends that it was </p>
<p>composed at the end of Paul’s lifetime, but by somebody other than Paul </p>
<p>at Paul’s own behest and approval, hence the autograph.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>e plausibility</p>
<p>of this scenario is enhanced by the observation of Margaret MacDonald: </p>
<p>“If we think of the authorship of Pauline works as a communal enterprise </p>
<p>undertaken by Paul and his entourage, the sharp distinction between </p>
<p>authentic and unauthentic epistles is signicantly reduced.”</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>I would</p>
<p>add that this does not make Paul merely the authorizer rather than the </p>
<p>author! He may have had varying degrees of input into his various let-</p>
<p>ters ranging from writing them himself (Philemon), writing them with </p>
<p>a coauthor (Colossians), dictating them (Romans), or authorizing their </p>
<p>composition based on an earlier piece of correspondence (Ephesians). </p>
<p>Given those qualications, I have no hesitation in arming Colossians </p>
<p>as authentically Pauline and written in association with others such as </p>
<p>Tychicus, Epaphras, Onesimus, Luke, and especially Timothy.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>Provenance of Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>Given the qualied assumption of Pauline authorship of Philemon, </p>
<p>Colossians, and (more loosely) Ephesians, when and where were the for-</p>
<p>mer two epistles written? What we can say is that Colossians and Philemon </p>
<p>were probably written in relatively close temporal proximity to each other </p>
<p>because the ve same persons are mentioned in Paul’s greetings in both </p>
<p>32. Dunn 1996: 38–39.</p>
<p>33. MacDonald 2008: 44.</p>
<p>34. On Timothy as author see Schweizer 1982: 23–25; Dunn 1996: 38–39. It is in-</p>
<p>teresting that two manuscripts state that Colossians was written “from Rome through </p>
<p>Tychicus and Onesimus” (075, 1739, 1881, and several Byzantine witnesses), which as-</p>
<p>sociates these Pauline coworkers with the letter’s composition and delivery.</p>
