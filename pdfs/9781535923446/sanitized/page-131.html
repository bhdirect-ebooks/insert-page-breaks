<p>Christian Houses in Pagan Cities</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>Whereas Roman law recognized the inalienable legal right of the master </p>
<p>over the slave, no such mandate exists in the Christian home, where it </p>
<p>is not the rule of Roman law but the impartiality of God that is the nal </p>
<p>principle for determining what is good and what is wrong. As such, mas-</p>
<p>ters are to act in a just and fair manner towards slaves, or else they too </p>
<p>risk the threat of punitive justice should they fail to appropriately manage </p>
<p>their houses in a righteous way. For instance, whereas slaves were vulner-</p>
<p>able to sexual exploitation and abuse by their masters, such activity is </p>
<p>inappropriate in light of what Paul says in the Colossian vice lists related </p>
<p>to sexual immorality (3:5). is goes to show that there is no mere light </p>
<p>coating of Christianity applied to pagan household codes. e relations </p>
<p>within the house exist under the auspices of their heavenly Lord, which </p>
<p>aects the relational dynamics and ethical imperatives within that house-</p>
<p>hold. While we might think of justice for slaves as requiring their eman-</p>
<p>cipation, in Paul’s world that was probably unthinkable. But for slaves </p>
<p>to hear their masters charged with acting justly towards them and even </p>
<p>being threatened with chastisement for unjust behavior, that would have </p>
<p>been comforting news. All in all, the Colossian household code is about </p>
<p>ordering communal life according to the sovereign authority of the Lord </p>
<p>and the wisdom required to live obediently in a pagan environment.</p>
