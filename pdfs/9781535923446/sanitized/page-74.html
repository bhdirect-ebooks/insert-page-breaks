<p>21</p>
<p>And you who were formerly alienated and enemies in</p>
<p>thought by evil deeds, </p>
<p>22</p>
<p>but now he has reconciled you in the</p>
<p>body of his esh through death, to present you as holy and </p>
<p>without blemish and irreproachable before him. </p>
<p>23</p>
<p>If indeed</p>
<p>you remain rmly established and steadfast in the faith not </p>
<p>swerving from the hope of the gospel which you heard, that </p>
<p>has been proclaimed in all of creation under heaven, of which </p>
<p>I, Paul, became a servant.</p>
<p>is section brings together both the thanksgiving of 1:3–14 and the </p>
<p>Christ Hymn of 1:15–20 by providing further grounds for thanksgiving </p>
<p>through the reconciling work of the Messiah as specically applied to the </p>
<p>Colossians. e train of thought in 1:21–23 appears to be: (1) the stark </p>
<p>transition the Colossians have experienced in being transferred from </p>
<p>enmity and hostility to holiness and hope, (2) the apparent need for the </p>
<p>Colossians to remain faithful to the gospel, (3) and the cosmic scope of the </p>
<p>gospel. ese short verses are signicant in so far as they summarize most </p>
<p>of the epistle up to this point, including hope and gospel (1:5), worldwide </p>
<p>mission (1:6), perseverance (1:11), salvation as transference to a new state </p>
<p>(1:12–14), and reconciliation through Jesus’s death (1:20). More broadly, </p>
<p>the whole section of 1:21—2:7 constitutes a rhetorical probatio or logical </p>
<p>argument that enumerates the main proposition. Paul here establishes the </p>
<p>grounds for their continued adherence to the gospel (as opposed to their </p>
<p>acceptance of the philosophy). He does this by setting forth the intrinsic </p>
value of what the gospel has already achieved in them, the divine honors
<p>accorded to the gospel messengers, and the privileges aorded to those </p>
