<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>letters, namely, Luke, Mark, Demas, Aristarchus, and Epaphras (Col </p>
<p>4:10–14; Phlm 23–24). Timothy is named as coauthor in both letters (Col </p>
<p>1:1; Phlm 1), a sending of Onesimus is referred to in both letters (Col 4:9; </p>
<p>Phlm 10, 12, 17), Archippus is mentioned in both (Col 4:17; Phlm 2), and </p>
<p>the two letters are undersigned with Paul’s own hand (Col 4:18; Phlm 19). </p>
<p>One peculiar fact is that Colossians makes no reference to any potential </p>
<p>conict between Onesimus and Philemon, which one might expect on </p>
<p>the return of a runaway slave to his owner which could adversely aect </p>
<p>relations within the community (see Paul’s exhortation for unity and rec-</p>
<p>onciliation among Euodia and Syntyche in Phil 4:2). Rather, in Col 4:9 </p>
<p>Onesimus is also regarded as a faithful and experienced coworker. e </p>
<p>letter to Philemon does not mention Tychicus. It would seem that there </p>
<p>was a gap between the composition of Philemon and Colossians,</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>which case the sending back of Onesimus in Phlm 12 and the sending of </p>
<p>Onesimus with Tychicus in Col 4:9 may reect two dierent journeys of </p>
<p>Onesimus to Colossae separated by several months or even up to a year. </p>
<p>I surmise that Paul rst sent Onesimus back to Philemon. Philemon was </p>
<p>reconciled to Onesimus and subsequently returned Onesimus to Paul’s </p>
<p>service as requested by Paul. Sometime later, the news of an encounter </p>
<p>with a certain “philosophy” in Colossae was relayed to Paul and his co-</p>
<p>workers who responded by writing Colossians and sending Tychicus and </p>
<p>Onesimus to deliver the letter to Colossae and a circular letter (Ephesians) </p>
<p>to the other churches of Asia and principally to Laodicea. I nd this sce-</p>
<p>nario plausible, though admittedly unveriable.</p>
<p>So where was Paul when this happened? He was obviously in </p>
<p>captivity (Phlm 1, 10, 23; Col 4:3, 10, 18), but which period of captiv-</p>
<p>ity, since he refers to imprisonments in the plural in 2 Cor 11:23 (cf. 1 </p>
<p>Clem. 5.6)? e main candidates are Ephesus (ca. 55–57 CE) or Rome </p>
<p>(ca. 61–66 CE).</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> is subject is one of the most perplexing facing stu-</p>
<p>dents of Colossians. e problem is mirrored in text-critical observations </p>
<p>since some manuscripts (e.g., A and B) regard Colossians as written from </p>
<p>35. Cf. Gnilka 1982: 5; Schweizer 1982: 24–25; Pokorný 1991: 9.</p>
<p>36. Another option put forward (e.g., Ellis 1999: 266–75; Reicke 2001: 75) is Caesarea </p>
<p>(Acts 23:33—26:32) where, according to Acts, Paul was imprisoned for two years (Acts </p>
<p>24:27). But Paul had no hope for an early release which is reected in Philemon (v. 22). </p>
<p>Caesarea would not have provided a likely outlet for Paul’s evangelistic work referred to </p>
<p>in Colossians (Col 4:3–4). Caesarea is also a less likely refuge for a runaway slave (see </p>
<p>Martin 1973: 24).</p>
