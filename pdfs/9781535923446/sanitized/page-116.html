<p>Colossians 3:5–11</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>the power of sin that once dominated them.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>In contrast to the teachers</p>
<p>who advocate asceticism and Torah as the cure to ever returning to pagan </p>
<p>revelry, for Paul the power unto a new obedience is the vitalizing grace </p>
<p>of God as exerted through the union with the Messiah and as symbolized </p>
<p>through the conduit of baptism. It is that faith and initiation into Messiah </p>
<p>that has the Colossians being renewed and conformed to the image of </p>
<p>God. While echoes of Gen 1:26–27 are quite clear, the verse harks back </p>
<p>to what Paul said in Col 1:15, where Jesus is the “image of the invisible </p>
<p>God,” and Paul also predicates the role of creator to Jesus in Col 1:16. </p>
<p>As Jesus Christ is the icon of God (Col 1:15; 2 Cor 4:4) so Christians, </p>
<p>when Messiah dwells in them, become renewed aer the image of God.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> </p>
<p>God’s recreation is according to the pattern of Jesus Christ who resembles </p>
<p>God’s absolute likeness.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>Jesus is both the Urmensch (original man) and</p>
<p>Übermensch (overcoming man). He is all at once the new Adam, that is, </p>
<p>the archetypal pattern of human existence, and simultaneously the tri-</p>
<p>umphant Messiah who reigns as the sovereign Lord over the dominion </p>
<p>of God. Hence, this gospel renewal looks back to creation in the pre-fall </p>
<p>state of humankind, but also looks forward to the eschaton where believ-</p>
<p>ers will be fully conformed to the pattern of Jesus and transformed to re-</p>
<p>ect the glory of the Messiah (cf. Rom 8:29; 1 Cor 15:49; 2 Cor 3:18; Phil </p>
<p>3:21). Harris oers this paraphrase: “you have stripped o the old Adamic </p>
<p>nature, the old humanity, together with the actions that expressed it, and </p>
<p>have put on the new nature you have in Christ, the new humanity, which </p>
<p>is being renewed day by day in conformity with Christ.”</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>At the mention of the new creation, Paul is unable to restrain his </p>
<p>excitement about its implications not only for ethics, but also for identity. </p>
<p>23. Martin 1973: 106. Cf. the Westminster Larger Catechism, Question 167: “How is </p>
<p>our Baptism to be improved by us?” e answer includes: “by drawing strength from the </p>
<p>death and resurrection of Christ, into whom we were baptized, for the mortifying of sin, </p>
<p>and quickening of grace, and by endeavouring to live by faith, to have our conservation </p>
<p>in holiness and righteousness, as those that have therein given up their names to Christ, </p>
<p>and to walk in brotherly love, as being baptized by the same Spirit into one body.”</p>
<p>24. On renewal in Paul’s letters see 2 Cor 4:16, Rom 12:2, Eph 4:23, and Titus 3:5. On </p>
<p>renewal in Pauline theology see especially Buchegger (2003) who contends that in Paul’s </p>
<p>writings renewal is the process of transformation into the image of God that is realized </p>
<p>through the operation of God’s glory and via the agency of the Spirit. e concept of </p>
<p>renewal is what links together Paul’s eschatology, soteriology, and anthropology.</p>
