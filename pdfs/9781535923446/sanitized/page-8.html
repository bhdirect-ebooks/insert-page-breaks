<p>Preface</p>
<p>viii</p>
<p>most part I’ve started with my own translation, had an occasional glance </p>
<p>at Jimmy Dunn’s and Peter O’Brien’s ne works to get some bearings, and </p>
<p>then tackled the text myself armed with nothing but lexical aids, consult-</p>
<p>ing the sundry secondary literature only aer this. Done this way I believe </p>
<p>that the commentary is much my own rather than an eclectic combina-</p>
<p>tion of everyone else’s. In the secondary literature, I have found the works </p>
<p>by Robin McL. Wilson, Markus Barth, Joseph Fitzmyer, N. T. Wright, </p>
<p>Charles Talbert, Andrew Lincoln, Murray Harris, and M. M. ompson </p>
<p>to be the most helpful, and I certainly cannot forget to mention the plea-</p>
<p>sure of working through John Chrysostom’s homilies and J. B. Lightfoot’s </p>
<p>commentary as well (how on earth did they do it without word processors </p>
<p>and Bible soware back then?).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>I have to thank several people for their support and assistance in </p>
<p>the lead up to this volume. First, my co-editor Craig Keener has been a </p>
<p>pleasure to work with. Craig has a rare combination of erudite scholar-</p>
<p>ship and pastoral sensitivity. I am most grateful that Craig took a chance </p>
<p>on working with a zany redhead Australian to launch a commentary se-</p>
<p>ries. His input into both this volume and the series as a whole has been </p>
<p>priceless. Second, the editorial team at Wipf and Stock is second to none. </p>
<p>K. C. Hanson and Chris Spinks have done a cracking good job of getting </p>
<p>this series going and were supportive of the project from the beginning. </p>
<p>K. C. has a wealth of experience in commentary production and he gave </p>
<p>me some golden advice as a new editor. ird, I have to thank my family </p>
<p>as always, including my wife Naomi and my daughters Alexis and Alyssa. </p>
<p>Fourth, several people read and oered helpful comments on an earlier </p>
<p>dra, including Lynn Cohick, Sean Du Toit, and Ian Smith, and I am </p>
<p>most grateful for their remarks. Fih, I would like to dedicate this book </p>
<p>to my good friend Ben Myers, who is making theology in the antipodes </p>
<p>fashionable again and is my syndoulos in the kingdom of Christ. His dedi-</p>
<p>cation to the theological cra is inspiring. May his tribe increase!</p>
<p>1. Unfortunately the commentaries on Colossians by Jerry L. Sumney and Douglas J. </p>
<p>Moo came out too late for me to be able to make use of them.</p>
