<p>Colossians 3:1–4</p>

<p>and the reign of Jesus over the cosmos (2:8). ese heavenly things are </p>
<p>opposed to the things below, which are the philosophy, human traditions, </p>
<p>the esh, elemental forces, and human made religious asceticism (2:8, 11, </p>
<p>13, 15, 16–18, 22–23). In the new self that they are to be clothed in, the </p>
<p>Colossians are to embody the things of heaven and manifest those virtues </p>
<p>that reect the life of Jesus Christ in their renewed existence.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>What is</p>
<p>more, because the Messiah has been enthroned at the right hand of God </p>
<p>(see Ps 110:1, the most cited ot passage in the nt) he possesses all au-</p>
<p>thority, majesty, and power, and naturally one looks to him as the source </p>
<p>and sustainer of authentic Christian life.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>e messianic promise that</p>
<p>God would exalt and honor the anointed one of Israel is fullled in Jesus’s </p>
<p>resurrection and ascension. As a consequence, the community looks to </p>
<p>Jesus as the Messiah whom God has exalted high above all earthly poten-</p>
<p>tates and powers. To use a paraphrase: “Set your hearts on and allow your </p>
<p>imagination to be liberated to comprehend Christ’s legitimate rule.”</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By virtue of looking to Messiah, the community of faith is linked to the </p>
<p>heavenly world and clings to him so that they might be free from that </p>
<p>which would draw them downwards.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>As Jesus is installed with authority</p>
<p>and power, no principality can prevent access to him, nor can any ascetic </p>
<p>tradition enhance the human capacity to enter into his presence, since </p>
<p>the initiative for salvation resides in God who transferred believers from </p>
<p>darkness to the kingdom of his Son (Col 1:13) and reconciled them to </p>
<p>himself (Col 1:20). Whereas the Stoics could urge people to seek the heav-</p>
<p>enly utopia or to apply heavenly perspectives to their earthly life, for Paul </p>
<p>seeking heavenly things requires seeking the Messiah.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>us, for Paul a</p>
<p>heavenly perspective on things will mean a Christ-centered perspective. </p>
<p>e fullness of the heavens that the teachers wish to lead the Colossians to </p>
<p>stands in contrast to Paul’s Messiah who is seated far above all angels and </p>
<p>intermediaries and rules heaven as God’s vice-regent.</p>
<p>e second “indicative” aspect is for you have died, and your life </p>
<p>has been hidden with Messiah in God, and this signies the destruction </p>
