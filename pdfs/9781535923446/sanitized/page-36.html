<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>ascents to heaven to behold angelic worship (e.g., Isa 6:2–3; Dan 7:10; </p>
<p>Luke 2:14; Rev 4–5). at is why this “self-abasement” is closely linked </p>
<p>to the “worship of angels” and going into detail about “visions which he </p>
<p>has seen.”</p>
<p>But what precisely is the “worship of angels”? Is it the worship of </p>
<p>angels themselves or worship with the angels? Traditionally, it has been </p>
<p>taken as an objective genitive, meaning worship directed at the angels, </p>
which could be occasioned by the view of angels as divine mediators, less-
<p>er deities, or stemming from an angel cult in Phyrgia. It is common today </p>
<p>to argue that it is a subjective genitive and refers to worship performed by </p>
<p>the angels. at corresponds with the narration found in various apoca-</p>
<p>lypses where prophets and saints of old are translated to God’s throne </p>
<p>and participate in the praises of heaven.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>e evidence from the Qumran</p>
<p>scrolls also shows that angelic worship was much coveted and the liturgy </p>
<p>of the sectarians was thought to include the presence of the angels (e.g., </p>
<p>1QH 3:21–22; 1QM 7:4–6; 1QSa 2:8–9; 1QSb 4:25–26). In particular, the </p>
<p>Songs of the Sabbath Sacrice (4Q400–5) describe the praise of angels in </p>
<p>the heavenly sanctuary where the angels are assembled in military forma-</p>
tion and provide anthems of divine blessing to God:
<p>e [Cheru]bim fall before Him and bless Him; as they arise, the </p>
<p>quiet voice of God [is heard], followed by a tumult of joyous praise. </p>
<p>As they unfold their wings, God’s q[uiet] voice is heard again. </p>
<p>e Cherubim bless the image of the chariot-throne that appears </p>
<p>above the rmament, [then] they joyously acclaim the [splend]or </p>
<p>of the luminous rmament that spreads beneath His glorious seat. </p>
<p>As the wheel-beings advance, holy angels come and go. Between </p>
<p>His chariot-throne’s glorious [w]heels appears something like an </p>
<p>utterly holy spiritual re. All around are what appear to be streams </p>
<p>of re, resembling electrum, and [sh]ining handiwork comprising </p>
<p>wondrous colors embroidered together, pure and glorious. e </p>
<p>spirits of the living [go]dlike beings move to and fro perpetually, </p>
<p>following the glory of the two [wo]ndrous chariots. A quiet voice </p>
<p>of blessing accompanies the tumult of their movement, and they </p>
<p>bless the Holy One each time they retrace their steps. When they </p>
<p>rise up, they do so wondrously, and when they settle down, they </p>
<p>[sta]nd still. e sound of joyous rejoicing falls silent, and the </p>
<p>qui[et] blessing of God spreads through all the camps of the di-</p>
