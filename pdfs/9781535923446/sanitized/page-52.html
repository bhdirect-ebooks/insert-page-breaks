<p>Colossians 1:3–8</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>Paul’s Thanksgiving for the Colossians’ </p>
<p>Participation in the Gospel (1:3–8)</p>
<p>Paul’s prayer begins with the rst person plural We always give thanks and </p>
<p>includes his coworkers in Ephesus (or Rome) and co-sender Timothy (cf. </p>
<p>1 ess 1:2; 2 ess 1:3). In ancient letters thanksgiving does not merely </p>
<p>display gratitude, but also gives the occasion for praise. In ancient letters </p>
<p>thanks was ordinarily given to the deity for the well being of the recipi-</p>
<p>ent and here Paul oers his thanks to the God and Father of our Lord </p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>e plural possessive pronoun our includes both the sender</p>
<p>and recipients as those who belong to Jesus Christ. e two entities (God </p>
<p>the Father and Lord Jesus) suggest that both are to be identied with the </p>
<p>God of Israel who is “Lord God.” e designation Lord Jesus Christ is </p>
<p>ubiquitous in the nt. Jesus as Lord is accompanied by reference to “God </p>
<p>and Father” in a number of places in Paul’s letters.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Later in Col 3:17 Paul</p>
<p>urges the Colossians to oer thanks to God through/in the Lord Jesus. In </p>
<p>Phil 2:11 the exaltation of Jesus as Lord is bound up with the glory of the </p>
<p>Father. What Jesus’s lordship means is best spelled out by “he is Lord of </p>
<p>all” (Acts 10:36).</p>
<p>e grounds for Paul’s thanksgiving is expressed in the triadic for-</p>
<p>mula of faithfulness . . . love . . . hope. e formula is common in Paul </p>
<p>(Rom 5:1–5; Gal 5:5–6; 1 ess 1:3; Eph 4:2–5) and in other Christian </p>
<p>literature, suggesting that it was a shorthand Christian virtue list (Heb </p>
<p>6:10–12; 10:22–24; 1 Pet 1:3–8, 21–22; Barn. 1:4; 11:8).</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Paul and his</p>
<p>companions have received reports from Epaphras of the Colossians’ </p>
<p>faithfulness in Messiah. Although pistis could be translated as “faith,” </p>
<p>I nd faithfulness to be the more likely given the literary context that </p>
<p>focuses on action and attitudes rather than on assent to a depositum cre-</p>
<p>3. I have put “Christ” in italics because it is used as a proper name here. In addition, </p>
<p>its textual integrity has some measure of doubt because (1) the word is not in B and little </p>
<p>reason for scribal omission (other than error) can be given, and (2) nowhere else in </p>
<p>Colossians is “Jesus Christ” found.</p>
<p>4. Cf. Rom 1:7; 15:6; 1 Cor 1:3; 8:6; 2 Cor 1:2–3; 11:31; Gal 1:3; Eph 1:2–3, 17; 5:20; </p>
<p>6:23; Phil 1:2; 2:11; 1 ess 1:1–3; 3:11–13; 2 ess 1:2; 2:16; 1 Tim 1:2; 2 Tim 1:2; Phlm </p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>5. Cf. Lightfoot (1879: 134): “Faith rests on the past; love works in the present; hope </p>
<p>looks to the future”; ompson (2005: 19): “e Christian virtues of ‘faith’ and ‘love’ are </p>
<p>not only responses to but also eects of the grace and power of the gospel of Christ.”</p>
