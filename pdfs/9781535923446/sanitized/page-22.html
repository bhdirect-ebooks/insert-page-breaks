<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Cor 1:2) whereas in Colossians (and Ephesians) the ekklēsia is both the </p>
<p>“church” local (Col 1:2; 4:15–16; cf. Eph 1:1) and the “Church” univer-</p>
<p>sal (Col 1:18, 24; cf. Eph 1:22; 3:10, 21; 5:23–25, 27, 29, 32).</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>Still, Paul</p>
<p>viewed the churches as a pan-Roman Empire movement who were in </p>
<p>close association with one another; there is nothing inconceivable about </p>
<p>him referring to “Church” in this more trans-local sense. Concerning </p>
<p>baptism and eschatology, Colossians refers to the baptized as those not </p>
<p>only buried with Christ but risen with him as well (2:11–12; 3:1; cf. Eph </p>
<p>2:5–6), whereas in Romans the resurrection of Christians is still future </p>
<p>(Rom 6:4–5). Yet in Romans, Paul can also refer to believers having been </p>
<p>“gloried” in the past tense (Rom 8:30) and glory also relates to a pres-</p>
<p>ent experience of the new covenant (2 Cor 3:18), which is not too many </p>
<p>steps away from Col 2:11–13; 3:1. What is more, Col 2:11–12 is not saying </p>
<p>that the resurrection has already taken place (as attributed to Hymenaeus </p>
<p>and Philetus in 2 Tim 2:17–18), but as Todd Still notes it merely employs </p>
<p>resurrection language to speak of a “believer’s conversion to, union with, </p>
<p>and transformation through Christ.” A future resurrection of believers is </p>
<p>implied by 1:18 where Jesus is the “rstborn from among the dead,” which </p>
<p>suggests that Christians will follow in his train (see 1 Cor 15:20).</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>Even</p>
<p>with a strong emphasis on realized eschatology in several places (1:12–13; </p>
<p>2:11–12, 15, 20; 3:1), the future horizon has not disappeared completely </p>
<p>in Colossians (1:5, 22, 24, 27–28; 3:4, 6, 10, 24–25) and it retains a reason-</p>
<p>able amount of congruity with the undisputed Pauline letters.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>Likewise,</p>
<p>the Christology of 1:15–20 and 2:9–10 may sound grandiose, yet it is not </p>
<p>out of order with 1 Cor 8:4–6; 2 Cor 8:9; and Phil 2:5–11, which contain </p>
<p>traditional material as well. e motif of victory in 2:15 is analogous to 1 </p>
<p>Cor 15:54–57 and Rom 8:29–39, 16:20 too. Similarly, the household code </p>
<p>of 3:18—4:1 is not the sexist regulations of a Pauline disciple who did </p>
<p>not share the apostle’s egalitarian view of women, but stands as part of a </p>
<p>natural trajectory from other elements of Paul’s letters about women and </p>
<p>households (e.g., 1 Cor 7:1–40; 11:3–16; 14:33–35). In sum, the question </p>
<p>of how much dierence and development it takes to illegitimate Pauline </p>
<p>authorship is unquantiable and is therefore grossly subjective. What a </p>
<p>29. I am unpersuaded by O’Brien (1982: xlv–xlvi, 57–61) who understands the </p>
<p>“church” in 1:18 as a reference to heavenly assembly around the risen Christ.</p>
