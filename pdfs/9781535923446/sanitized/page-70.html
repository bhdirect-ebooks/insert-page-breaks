<p>Colossians 1:18b–20</p>

<p>place” (nrsv, nasb, net).</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> Here we are talking about far more than be-</p>
<p>ing a very important person. We are talking about authority, honor, and </p>
<p>power rolled into one. e most analogous background I can think of is </p>
<p>the Roman emperor Augustus who claimed to exceed everyone in auc-</p>
<p>toritas, that is, a combination of power and prestige. e Augustan age </p>
<p>created a pyramid of power and hierarchy that put him inviolably at the </p>
<p>top. Indicative of this is that Augustus held the proconsulship of Rome </p>
<p>well beyond the normal limitations of service; he was invested with the </p>
<p>power of the tribunate with right of veto over the senate; he was the prin-</p>
<p>ceps or chief citizen of the government; he had direct military command </p>
<p>of over three quarters of the Roman legions, the power of intervention </p>
<p>in imperial provinces; and he was given titles like pontifex maximus, or </p>
“high priest” of the empire, and Imperator Caesar divi lius, “emperor and
<p>son of a god.” e implied rhetoric in this poem is that as the preeminent </p>
<p>one Jesus is the real auctoritas over and against the pretentious claims </p>
of earthly rulers to be sovereign and divine. is becomes all the more
<p>powerful if we remember that Paul is imprisoned, in Rome or Ephesus, </p>
<p>during the reign of Emperor Nero when writing this. Roman emperors, </p>
<p>at death or even while alive, could be lauded as a god, a son of god, or be </p>
<p>numbered among a series of deities in a cosmic, cyclic order.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>Political</p>
<p>potentates and heavenly powers were intertwined in antiquity (e.g., Isa </p>
<p>14:4–27). But Caesar was at best a twisted parody of the real Lord of the </p>
<p>world and at worst a malevolent tyrant who created “empire” and “peace” </p>
<p>through the application of violence. e Pictish King Calgacus is por-</p>
<p>trayed as saying: “ese plunderers of the world having taken all the land, </p>
<p>now claim the seas, so that even if we y to the sea there is no safety from </p>
<p>them. ey kill and slay, and take what is not theirs, and call it Empire. </p>
<p>ey make a desert and call it Peace.”</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>e Jesus of Colossians brooks</p>
<p>no rivals, be they the malevolent powers of the cosmos or brutal dicta-</p>
<p>tors in a foreign land. A second thought is proered by Paul: Jesus has </p>
<p>unique qualication to be the agent of reconciliation. Paul says that in </p>
<p>him [God] was pleased to have all his fullness dwell. e subject for </p>
<p>the verb pleased (eudokeō) is missing, but the implied subject is prob-</p>
<p>ably God (or perhaps a periphrasis: “God in all his fullness”). God was </p>
<p>30. e word prōteuōn might even be an honoric title. See NDIEC 2:96; and W. </p>
<p>Michaelis, TDNT 6:881–82.</p>
