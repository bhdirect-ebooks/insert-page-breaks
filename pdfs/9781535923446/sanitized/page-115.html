<p>death, believers are delivered from God’s wrath (Rom 5:9; 1 ess 1:10; </p>
<p>5:9) since Jesus has propitiated God’s wrath with such nality and with </p>
<p>such perfection that none remains for them (Rom 3:25).</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>e objects</p>
<p>of wrath are described as sons of disobedience, which, though textually </p>
<p>questionable,</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>may be taken as a euphemism for sons of perdition (see</p>
<p>John 17:12) and reects the Hebrew idiom that a son’s conduct reects his </p>
<p>paternal origins. e relevance of this description of human depravity is </p>
<p>that you formerly walked in them when you lived in these things, and </p>
<p>Paul (as he does elsewhere, e.g., Col 1:21 and 1 Cor 1:26–31; 6:9–11; 12:2; </p>
<p>Gal 4:8–9; Eph 2:1–3) poses a sharp contrast between what the believ-</p>
<p>ers were before Messiah and what they are now in Messiah. ose that </p>
<p>walked and lived in such disobedience experienced the depersonalizing </p>
<p>eects of sin and alienation from the Creator (see Rom 1:18–32).</p>
<p>e temporal contrast gives way to a logical contrast with but now, </p>
<p>which echoes Paul’s eschatological “now” that marks the coming of the </p>
<p>new age in the Messiah (cf. Col 1:22; Eph 2:13; Rom 3:21). What the </p>
<p>Colossians are to do in order to further the transition from their former </p>
<p>life to their new life in Messiah is to put o all such things. is leads </p>
<p>to another vice list that can be grouped into sins of aggression (anger, </p>
<p>wrath, malice) and sins of the tongue (slander, perverse talk, lie to one </p>
<p>another). What makes this a possibility that Paul expects to be realized </p>
<p>is not a more stringent and concerted application of the moral will, but </p>
<p>rather the power and glory of the new creation spilling over into their </p>
<p>lives. is is verbalized with have stripped o the old man with its deeds </p>
<p>and having clothed yourselves with the new man which is being renewed </p>
<p>according to the image of the one creating him. e aorist participles </p>
<p>(apekdusamenoi, stripped o; endusamenoi, having clothed) probably </p>
<p>hark back to their baptism (Col 3:1) as the point in which they rst put </p>
<p>on Messiah and put o the world (Gal 3:27; cf. Rom 13:14; 1 Pet 5:5). Paul </p>
<p>calls on the Colossians to remember their faith, confession, baptism, and </p>
<p>the dynamic power that operates in them because it releases them from </p>
<p>21. On “wrath” see the helpful discussion in O’Brien 1982: 184–85.</p>
<p>22. e phrase “sons of disobedience” is absent from many textual witnesses (e.g., P</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> </p>
<p>D* B Clement Cyprian Ambrosiaster Jerome) and it may have been added by scribes in </p>
<p>order to line up with Eph 5:6. Alternatively, the reading before us is contained in a good </p>
<p>many witnesses (e.g., ) A C D</p>
<p>vid</p>
<p> F G H K L P 33 it vg syr</p>
<p>p</p>
<p>Clement Chrysostom) and v.</p>
<p>7 seems to imply a previous mention of morally reprobate Gentiles, so it may in fact be </p>
<p>authentic (Metzger 1994: 557; McL. Wilson 2005: 246).</p>
