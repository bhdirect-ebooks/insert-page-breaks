<p>because it conforms to perceived cultural norms of appropriate marital </p>
<p>relations?</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>We are le to guess. e obverse charge to the Husbands is to</p>
<p>love your wives and do not be harsh with them. Love is the most supreme </p>
<p>ingredient in Christian ethics for Paul (see 3:14).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>What love in action</p>
<p>means is best spelled out by reference to the parallel passage in Ephesians </p>
<p>where husbands are commanded to “love your wives as Messiah loved </p>
<p>the church and gave himself up for her” (Eph 5:25). In addition, a further </p>
<p>admonition upon husbands is to not be harsh with her, which is a clear </p>
<p>command against brutish and abusive behavior towards wives.</p>
<p>e topic shis from husbands/wives to parents/children. e chil-</p>
<p>dren of the household are to obey your parents in every respect, and this </p>
<p>pertains to all matters since parents, especially fathers and guardians, had </p>
<p>legal rights over their children. e justication for this attitude is that it </p>
<p>is pleasing in the Lord, which is a key motivation for the Christian life </p>
<p>according to Paul (Rom 12:1–2; 14:18; 2 Cor 5:9; Eph 5:10; Phil 4:18; see </p>
<p>esp. Col 1:10), and honoring one’s parents is commanded in the Decalogue </p>
<p>(Exod 20:12; Deut 5:16; cf. Matt 15:4–5; 19:19). e command applied </p>
<p>to fathers, do not antagonize your children, lest they become disheart-</p>
<p>ened, mirrors the relation of husbands/wives where the call for submis-</p>
<p>sion is matched by a subsequent command for husbandly authority not </p>
<p>to be abused. In regards to children, this means the specic avoidance of </p>
<p>behavior that rouses anger and demoralizes rather than builds up.</p>
<p>Household Relations between Masters and Slaves </p>
<p>(3:22—4:1)</p>
<p>e slave/master relationship is addressed next in the Colossians house-</p>
<p>hold code. Among the Colossian Christians relations between slaves </p>
<p>and masters had not always been amicable as the relationship between </p>
<p>Philemon and Onesimus shows. Paul arms not the institution of slav-</p>
<p>ery, which is simply assumed, but how it was to be lived out in Christian </p>
<p>community (see “Paul and Slavery” in the introduction). e instruc-</p>
<p>tions here must be seen in light of 3:11; the authority of masters over </p>
<p>slaves must be situated as part of a wider christological reality of unity in </p>
<p>Christ. Unlike 1 Pet 2:18–25, the issue here is not about Christian slaves </p>
