<p>Fusing the Horizons: Christological Assertions</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>Nazarene who had been executed only thirty years earlier was now heralded </p>
<p>and identiﬁed with the God of creation and reconciliation.</p>

<p>There is no room</p>
<p>for idolatry or pluralism. Jesus does not accept rivals and his supremacy has </p>
<p>no limits. To quote Abraham Kuyper, there is nothing in the universe of which </p>
<p>Jesus cannot say, “mine!” For members of the new covenant community, that </p>
<p>means ordering their lives according to the teachings, symbols, story, mission, </p>
<p>and purpose of their sovereign Lord. It means summoning an unbelieving </p>
<p>world to faith and repentance in the one who commands their obedience and </p>
<p>achieves their salvation. It means declaring to agents of evil and structures of </p>
<p>injustice that people and their love for power will always succumb to the power </p>
<p>of God’s love in Messiah. Thus, the body of Christ can engage those structures </p>
<p>and institutions that create war, poverty, and injustice. For instance, Christian </p>
<p>organizations like the International Justice Mission attempt to secure justice </p>
<p>for victims of slavery, sexual exploitation, and other forms of violent oppres-</p>
<p>sion. The Jesus who is proclaimed by the global church as Lord and Redeemer </p>
<p>brings good news to the poor and oppressed. The Messiah will bring justice </p>
<p>to the world at the end of ages. Until then his people warn of this coming </p>
<p>cataclysmic judgment and work concurrently against the inhumanities of hu-</p>
<p>manity as a foretaste of that day.</p>
