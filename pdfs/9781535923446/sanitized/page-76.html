<p>e gospel they are to hold on to is the same one that has been</p>
<p>proclaimed in all of creation under heaven. Much like what Paul did in </p>
<p>1:6, he puts the Colossians’ reception of the gospel in a global and even </p>
<p>cosmic context. What is happening to them is a microcosm of what is </p>
<p>happening elsewhere in the world. e phrase all of creation is certainly </p>
<p>hyperbolic, since Paul’s missionary endeavors only encompassed selected </p>
<p>regions in the eastern Mediterranean from “Jerusalem and as far around </p>
<p>as Illyricum” (Rom 15:19). Nonetheless, through the work of Paul, God </p>
<p>and God’s Son were being proclaimed to peoples who knew only the do-</p>
<p>main of darkness. Indeed, Paul’s service has a unique role in the unfolding </p>
<p>of the mystery of God, which has recently been made known.</p>
