<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>• Colossaemayhavebeendestroyedin61–62 CE leaving Paul no </p>
<p>one to even write to.</p>
<p>e marginally less problematic of these options then is the Ephesian </p>
<p>provenance.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>I surmise that the epistle to Philemon was written by Paul</p>
<p>himself during an imprisonment in Ephesus (ca. 55–57 CE) and Philemon </p>
<p>subsequently discharged Onesimus to Paul’s service where he became </p>
<p>thereaer part of Paul’s entourage. Colossians was written cooperatively </p>
<p>by Paul and his coworkers (Col 1:1; 4:7–17) from Ephesus and was deliv-</p>
<p>ered by Tychicus and Onesimus. Ephesians was written by a secretary of </p>
<p>Paul at Paul’s behest and composed on the basis of Colossians in order to </p>
<p>be given to the Pauline churches of Asia Minor, including Ephesus and </p>
<p>Laodicea, as the letter carriers passed through those regions on their way </p>
<p>to deliver the correspondence to Colossae. In editorial language, Paul is </p>
<p>the author of Philemon, the managing editor and chief contributor to </p>
<p>Colossians, and the commissioning editor of Ephesians.</p>
<p>The Colossian Philosophy</p>
<p>Another confusing matter is the nature of the Colossian “philosophy.”</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have no direct account of the philosophy by the teachers themselves, </p>
<p>but are reliant entirely upon what Paul says about them, directly and in-</p>
<p>directly, in Colossians. What Paul wrote against the philosophy is itself </p>
<p>based on what he was told about them from others and is admixed with </p>
<p>some general exhortations that could apply to many doctrinal intrusions </p>
<p>among Christian groups. It is hard to determine the precise contours of </p>
<p>the philosophy since Paul speaks of them explicitly only at limited points </p>
<p>(2:4, 8, 16–23) and elsewhere perhaps only implicitly (1:15–20, 22–23; </p>
<p>2:2–3; 3:1–2).</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>ere is also the problem of trying to understand what</p>
<p>kind of religious label the philosophy ts into. J. J. Gunther listed forty-</p>
<p>four dierent identications of Paul’s opponents in Colossae in his 1973 </p>
<p>44. I have changed my mind on this since Bird 2008a: 65. Note also the hesitancy of </p>
<p>Moule 1957: 24; and Dunn 1996: 41.</p>
<p>45. I prefer the term “philosophy” since that is the word used to describe the view-</p>
<p>point that Paul is opposing in Colossians (2:8) and other terms like “error” or “heresy” </p>
<p>presuppose later standards of orthodoxy.</p>
<p>46. On the methodology for trying to identify Paul’s opponents in Colossae see </p>
<p>Sumney 1993; Wolter 1993: 156; DeMaris 1994: 41–45; Arnold 1996: 4; Stettler 2005: </p>
