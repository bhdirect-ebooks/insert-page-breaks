<p>Colossians 2:8–15</p>

<p>cised with a circumcision without human hands. Paul will have much </p>
<p>more to say about that contrast in Col 3:1–12, but now the life of God </p>
<p>comes via being made alive with him. To have life is to be in the Messiah. </p>
<p>In fact, in 3:4 Paul says the Messiah is “your life,” and this life in the here </p>
<p>and now is accessible through being forgiven (see 1:14). Forgiveness itself </p>
<p>stands with redemption, new exodus, reconciliation, and participation as </p>
<p>one of the many metaphors for salvation in Colossians.</p>
<p>At this crucial moment in his argument, Paul refers back to the cross </p>
as the grounds for forgiveness and the instrument of divine victory over
<p>evil. Paul continues his explication of the superiority of the Messiah over </p>
<p>the philosophy with reference to the cross, but now casts it in cosmic and </p>
<p>triumphalistic terms. Jesus has erased the manuscript, which is character-</p>
<p>ized as making claims stated in certain decrees</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>that are against us. e</p>
<p>metaphor is undoubtedly legal as the word cheirographon literally means </p>
<p>the written receipt of a debt owed (cf. “certicate of debt” nasb; “bond” </p>
<p>rsv).</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>But here the word takes on a decidedly ethical meaning related</p>
<p>to behavioral obligations put in written form that persons are somehow </p>
<p>evaluated against. So what exactly is this manuscript? ere are a num-</p>
<p>ber of options. (1) A heavenly book recording the various deeds of per-</p>
<p>sons upon which they are held to account on the day of reckoning. Such </p>
<p>books are attested in the Jewish Scriptures and developed in apocalyptic </p>
<p>literature (Exod 32:32–33; Ps 69:28; Dan 12:1; Rev 3:5; cf. Jub. 4:23; 39:6; </p>
<p>1 En. 81:2–4; 89:61–64, 70–71; 96:7; 97:5–7; 104:7; 108:7; 2 En. 44:5–7; </p>
<p>50:1; 52:15; 53:2–3; Apoc. Ab. 7:1–8; Apoc. Zeph. 3:6–9; 7:1–11; Apoc. </p>
<p>Paul 17). (2) What is more likely, however, is that it refers to the Torah, </p>
<p>or at least Torah’s claim to render condemnation over persons for their </p>
<p>transgressions. e teachers combine Torah and their specic teachings </p>
<p>in 2:21–22, which are then linked to “judging” others in 2:16.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>But could</p>
<p>21. e decrees (dogma, cf. 2:20 dogmatizō) could refer to the rules within a philo-</p>
<p>sophical system like Pythagoreanism, but the same word can stand for “commandments” </p>
<p>pertaining to the Torah (e.g., 3 Macc 1.3; Josephus Ag. Ap. 1.42; Philo Leg. 1.55; Gig. 52). </p>
<p>e word occurs in Eph 2:15 where it is explicitly linked to the Mosaic law, i.e., “the law </p>
<p>with its commandments and decrees.”</p>

<p>1991: 107–8. Several patristic authors (e.g., John Chrysostom, eodore of Mopsuestia, </p>
<p>Severian of Gabala) also see a reference to the Old Testament law here (Gorday 2000: 33). </p>
<p>Lightfoot (1879: 187) takes the decrees as “though referring primarily to the Mosaic or-</p>
<p>dinances, will include all forms of positive decrees in which moral or social principles are </p>
