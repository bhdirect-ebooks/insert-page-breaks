<p>Closing Words of Exhortation from a Missionary Friend</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>ence towards outsiders with a view to inviting them to share in the faith </p>
<p>and community of the Lord. ese instructions are for a church expected </p>
<p>to hold their own in the market places, baths, forums, and meal tables of </p>
<p>the city and to win attention by the attractiveness of their way of life and </p>
<p>their manner of speech.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Final Instruction and Greeting (4:7–18)</p>
<p>News of Paul’s situation is to be conveyed by Tychicus and Onesimus </p>
<p>who are the couriers of the letter to the Colossians. e former is </p>
<p>named elsewhere in the New Testament as a believer from Asia, perhaps </p>
<p>Ephesus, and he seems to have been a favorite envoy of Paul (Acts 20:4; </p>
<p>Eph 6:21; 2 Tim 4:12; Titus 3:12). Onesimus was the formerly estranged </p>
<p>slave of Philemon with whom he had been reconciled and by whom he </p>
<p>was returned to Paul as requested by Paul (Phlm 13). Both men are de-</p>
<p>scribed as beloved brothers and as faithful (Tychicus is also described </p>
<p>as a servant and fellow slave), which echoes Paul’s description of the </p>
<p>Colossians themselves in 1:2. e news that they pass on is intended to </p>
<p>encourage your hearts, which may be a veiled way of saying that they </p>
<p>will exhort the Colossians to remain true to the gospel in light of the </p>
<p>intrusive philosophy.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Paul proceeds to name three Jewish Christian coworkers with him </p>
<p>who also send their greetings. e rst is Aristarchus, who is described </p>
<p>as a fellow prisoner and is to be identied with Aristarchus from Acts, </p>
<p>a Macedonian from essalonica (Acts 19:29; 20:4; 27:2; Phlm 24). e </p>
<p>second is John Mark, the Cypriot Jewish Christian who at one time de-</p>
<p>serted Paul (Acts 13:13; 15:37–41) but seems to have been reconciled to </p>
<p>him at some point prior to this (Phlm 24; 2 Tim 4:11). In a later time, </p>
<p>Mark was part of Peter’s circle in Rome (1 Pet 5:13). e Colossians have </p>
<p>already received instructions about a possible visit by John Mark (from a </p>
<p>previous letter or an oral report) and Paul underscores that he may send </p>
<p>John Mark to them in the future and they should receive him accord-</p>
<p>ingly. e nal coworker Paul mentions, Jesus who is called Justus, is a </p>
<p>Jewish Christian who added a “t” to his name for a transition from Iēsous </p>
