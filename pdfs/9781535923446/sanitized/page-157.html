<p>e Pathos and Persuasion of the Apostle</p>
<p>143</p>
<p>Philemon now. e apostle casts the thanksgiving prayer into an impera-</p>
<p>tive. Paul concludes his comments by indicating his condent assurance </p>
<p>that Philemon will respond positively to his request to receive Onesimus </p>
<p>as a brother. Philemon will hopefully prove obedient in the end, out of </p>
<p>love and not compulsion. Paul adds you will do even more than I ask, in-</p>
<p>dicating the prospect of Philemon not only receiving Onesimus, but also </p>
<p>returning him to Paul’s presence. e willingness of Paul to visit Philemon </p>
<p>in Colossae marked by prepare a guest room for me is hard to reconcile </p>
<p>with a Roman provenance and is more believable in an Ephesian setting </p>
<p>in the mid to late 50s CE. Paul feels that he can presume upon Philemon’s </p>
<p>prayers for him and count on a warm reception should he ever visit the </p>
<p>location. As Adolf Schlatter commented: “e prayers of the community </p>
<p>in its salvation provided Paul with a power from God.”</p>
