<p>Colossians 3:5–11</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>teachers wish to impose partial Torah observance on the Colossians in </p>
<p>order to restrain their eshly desires (what the Rabbis called the yetzer </p>
<p>hara or “evil impulse”). at is tantamount to putting the wild animals of </p>
<p>lust, hatred, and greed into cages where they remain alive and continue to </p>
<p>be a dangerous threat to their captors. Paul’s solution is more radical: the </p>
<p>animals need to be killed.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>e command put to death can be related to</p>
<p>similar commands in v. 8, put o/strip o, with a net aect of doing away </p>
<p>with such behaviors. e phrasing in relation to earthly is awkward and </p>
<p>can be interpreted dierently (e.g., “mundane ordinances” [Lightfoot], </p>
<p>“whatever in you is earthly” [nrsv], “whatever in your nature belongs </p>
<p>to the earth” [net], “things used for earthly purposes” [Harris], “earthly </p>
<p>things lurking within you” [nlt]).</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>But the point is to allow a heavenly</p>
<p>perspective to determine one’s being rather than allowing an earthbound </p>
<p>perspective to shape one’s behavior. What that means is underscored with </p>
<p>the following vice list in which Paul urges them to put to death certain </p>
<p>activities and attitudes: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, </p>
<p>and greed which is idolatry. Vice lists are common in both Paul’s letters </p>
<p>and in Jewish and Greco-Roman literature.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> Its function here is to pro-</p>
<p>vide real content to activities and attitudes that are proscribed. Further </p>
<p>explanation is given is v. 7: because of which the wrath of God is coming </p>
<p>upon the sons of disobedience. e avoidance of such vices is not only </p>
<p>because they adversely aect the domains of horizontal (human–human) </p>
and vertical (human–divine) relationships, but because such things occa-
<p>sion the wrath of God. Wrath (orgē) is understood here not in the sense </p>
<p>of God’s capacity for unbridled violence, but as the righteous indignation </p>
<p>of God’s holiness towards moral evil.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>For Paul, God’s wrath is something</p>
<p>that comes as a result of God’s character and due to the eschatological </p>
<p>trajectory that will see all wickedness subdued and punished by the ines-</p>
<p>capable justice of God (see Rom 1:18; 2:5; 1 ess 2:16). Because of Jesus’s </p>
<p>17. Wright 1986: 128.</p>
<p>18. e meaning depends on whether the word gēs (“earth”) is taken as a substantive </p>
<p>adjective “earthly” or as a noun “earth.”</p>
<p>19. Cf. e.g., Wis 14:25–26; 4 Macc 1:26–27; 2:15; 1QS 4:9–11; 2 En. 10:4–5. If some </p>
<p>think that Paul’s vice lists are needless long and detailed then I urge a comparison with </p>
<p>the vice lists compiled by Philo Sacr. 32,which includes 150 prohibited vices and behav-</p>
<p>iours. Paul’s lists are meager in comparison.</p>
<p>20. As McL. Wilson (2005: 247) puts it, God “is not a benign old gentleman over </p>
<p>whose eyes the wool may be pulled with impunity, a god whose only function is to </p>
<p>forgive.”</p>
