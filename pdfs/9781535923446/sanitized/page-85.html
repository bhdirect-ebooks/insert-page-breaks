<p>Paul’s Service </p>
<p>71</p>
<p>to live. Paul returns to the halakic metaphor of 1:10 (“walk worthily of the </p>
<p>Lord”) by urging them to walk in him, which is equivalent to remaining </p>
<p>loyal to and grounded in the faith that they were rst taught. Such delity </p>
<p>is incomplete of course unless it is accompanied with thanksgiving. In </p>
<p>this way, Paul links together their beliefs and social identity as followers </p>
<p>of Jesus with their devotional life as well.</p>
<p>Paul clearly wants to shore up the actual content of what the </p>
<p>Colossians hold to by arguing for the suciency of the knowledge and </p>
<p>wisdom contained in the faith they received. Much like Gal 3:1–5, he </p>
<p>wants them to add nothing to the faith and hope that they have begun </p>
<p>in. But another signicant component of Paul’s strategy is to remind the </p>
<p>Colossians that their identity is bound up with a network of other believ-</p>
<p>ers spread across adjacent regions. e suerings and strife of the other </p>
<p>churches is for them, and they are partners in that struggle. Paul’s narra-</p>
<p>tion of his apostolic ministry is not a self-congratulatory digression but is </p>
<p>intrinsic to his argument, as he must persuade an audience that he does </p>
<p>not know directly the relevance of his oce and his message for their </p>
<p>particular context.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Paul defends the gospel in Colossae by reiterating</p>
<p>their solidarity with other believers and by emphasizing the suciency of </p>
<p>their faith. ey are also beneciaries of the mystery of God made known </p>
<p>to them in knowledge of the Messiah. e dispute in Colossae, or at least </p>
<p>Paul and his coworker’s perception of it, ultimately revolves around what </p>
<p>they have received about the Messiah and who they are in the Messiah.</p>
