<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>it may signicantly alter much of what we claim to know about Judaism, </p>
<p>indigenous religions, and Christianity in Colossae. In fact, Colossians </p>
<p>commentaries may need to be rewritten in light of the evidence that </p>
<p>emerges.</p>
<p>Relationship of Colossians to Ephesians</p>
<p>Colossians stands conceptually between Galatians and Ephesians, while </p>
<p>Philemon is probably the closest in style to Philippians. Colossians has a </p>
<p>mix of Pauline polemics indicative of Galatians and the lavish language </p>
<p>and high Christology of Ephesians. Ephesians and Colossians are simi-</p>
<p>lar in many respects as both are said to be delivered by Tychicus (Col </p>
<p>4:7–9; Eph 6:21), they exhibit similar language, theological concerns </p>
<p>(e.g., “mystery,” “raised with Christ,” catholic “Church”), and share een </p>
<p>words not found elsewhere in other New Testament writings. e literary </p>
<p>parallels between Colossians and Ephesians are numerous (see the table </p>
<p>below) and have usually led to a literary relationship being posited be-</p>
<p>tween the two documents.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Although some have argued that Colossians</p>
<p>depends on Ephesians, the reverse seems far more likely given the use of </p>
<p>Old Testament quotations and allusions in Ephesians that is lacking in </p>
<p>Colossians. ese quotations and allusions are more likely to have been </p>
<p>added than subtracted by an author or redactor. ere is also a greater </p>
<p>focus on the church universal and more attention given to the Holy Spirit </p>
<p>in Ephesians, which suggests theological explication of something found </p>
<p>in Colossians. ese letters are genetically related, but also somewhat in-</p>
<p>dependent of one another given the dierences in purpose, audience, and </p>
<p>even contents, showing how complicated the issue of literary dependency </p>
<p>really is.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>e historical circumstances of their common relationship can</p>
<p>only be judged once the questions of the authorship and the provenance </p>
<p>of Colossians and Philemon are satisfactorily answered.</p>
<p>13. See the synoptic parallels provided by Kooten 2003 and further lists of parallels </p>
<p>in Talbert 2007: 4–5. I nd that a comparison of Eph 6:21–22 and Col 4:7–8 clearly sup-</p>
<p>ports some sort of literary relationship between the two writings. Yet F. C. Baur overstates </p>
<p>the case when he writes, “e whole contents of the two Epistles are substantially the </p>
<p>same,” and asserts that Ephesians and Colossians are so interwoven “that they stand or </p>
<p>fall together in their claim to apostolic origin” ([1873–75] 2003: vol. 2, 4, 44).</p>
<p>14. On the independent nature of Colossians from Ephesians, see Ellis 1999: 110–11; </p>
<p>and Talbert 2007: 4–6; while Barth and Blanke (1994: 72–114) argue that the problem of </p>
<p>literary dependency is unsolved and perhaps unsolvable.</p>
