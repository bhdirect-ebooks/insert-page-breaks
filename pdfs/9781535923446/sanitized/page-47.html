<p>Letter Opening and greeting (1:1–2)</p>
<p>1 </p>
<p>Paul, an Apostle of Messiah Jesus through the will of God </p>
<p>and Timothy our brother. </p>
<p>2 </p>
<p>To the holy and faithful brothers </p>
<p>and sisters in Messiah in Colossae. Grace to you and peace </p>
<p>from God our Father.</p>
<p>e letter begins with a standard epistolary prescript detailing the </p>
<p>sender and recipient. At the head of the letter stands Paul, an Apostle of </p>
<p>Messiah Jesus. e mention of Paul introduces the apostle as the author </p>
<p>(or coauthor) of the communication. Paul did not establish the church </p>
<p>in Colossae, but he would no doubt have been known to the Colossian </p>
<p>assembly through Epaphras who was probably sent by Paul to establish </p>
<p>house churches in the Lycus Valley (Col 1:7; 4:12; Phlm 23). Paul’s evan-</p>
<p>gelistic activities and hardships faced in Ephesus (1 Cor 15:32; 16:8; Acts </p>
<p>18:19; 19:1–41; 20:17–38) would have been among the things for which </p>
<p>he was known. e letter stands as a substitute then for his personal </p>
<p>presence and is also all the more important given the current absence </p>
<p>of Epaphras and the uncertainties surrounding the eectiveness of the </p>
<p>ministry of Archippus (Col 4:17; Phlm 2). As usual, Paul identies him-</p>
<p>self as an apostle, and apostolos means “one who is sent” or an authorized </p>
<p>emissary of a third party. One can be the apostle of a church (2 Cor 8:23; </p>
<p>Phil 2:25), but Paul is an apostle of Jesus Christ (Rom 1:1; 1 Cor 1:1; 2 Cor </p>
<p>1:1; Gal 1:1; Eph 1:1; 1 Tim 1:1; 2 Tim 1:1; Titus 1:1).</p>
<p>It is none other than Messiah Jesus who is the source of Paul’s com-</p>
<p>mission and authority as an apostle. Unlike other Pauline letters, what is </p>
<p>at stake here is not Paul’s authority as an apostle (e.g., Gal, 2 Cor), but the </p>
<p>nature of the sending gure Messiah Jesus in light of the Colossian phi-</p>
<p>losophy. I have rendered Christos Iēsous as Messiah Jesus, using “Messiah” </p>
<p>rather than “Christ” for Christos in order to emphasize the Jewish and </p>
<p>eschatological connotation of the designation for Paul (although I rec-</p>
