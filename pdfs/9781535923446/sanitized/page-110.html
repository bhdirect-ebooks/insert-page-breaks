<p>Colossians 3:1–17</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>from God; but it carries a challenge. If we accept that challenge, we begin </p>
<p>to belong to the nal event, to God’s ultimate purpose: we have entered </p>
<p>into the new covenant . . . But the process of fully becoming detached </p>
<p>from the old and fully belonging to the new remains to be painfully and </p>
<p>laboriously completed.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Importantly, 3:1–17 does not constitute an insertion of general </p>
<p>Christian paranesis or moral exhortation into this segment of the letter </p>
<p>independent of the literary context. ere is an indelible link to what has </p>
<p>gone before.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> e imagery of 3:1 picks up the theme of Christ’s resurrec-</p>
<p>tion and triumph in 2:10, 12, 15 and lordship in 1:15–20. e reference </p>
<p>to death in 3:3 echoes 2:12, 20 where death with the Messiah abounds </p>
<p>in liberation from all forms of evil. e virtue of humility in 3:12 con-</p>
<p>trasts naturally with the false humility of the teachers in 2:18, 23. e </p>
<p>apocalyptic motif of 3:3–4 rehearses Paul’s earlier remarks in 1:26–27 </p>
<p>and 2:2–3 about mystery/hidden things being revealed. Paul is returning </p>
<p>to a theme in the introduction of this epistle, where his prayer was that </p>
<p>the Colossians would “walk worthily of the Lord in order to fully please </p>
<p>him, bearing fruit in every good work and growing in the knowledge of </p>
<p>God” (1:10). Paul intends the Colossians to be completely renewed in </p>
<p>their understanding of God and morally transformed in regards to their </p>
<p>lives, producing God-pleasing behavior. Fundamental to the exhortation </p>
<p>in this section is taxis or “ordering” one’s life according to the symbol of </p>
<p>baptism where one has died and risen with Christ (2:5, 11–12; 3:1) and </p>
<p>according to the new creation which brings believers into the new age and </p>
<p>renders null and void their ethnic and gender distinctions in the economy </p>
<p>of salvation (3:11). It is also about implementing the “word of Messiah,” </p>
<p>which is the pattern of teaching from the Messiah and about the Messiah </p>
<p>(3:16). is in turn generates a new praxis that transforms one’s ethics, </p>
<p>speech, values, relationships, attitudes, actions, and worldview. e new </p>
<p>covenant community is one that embodies and fullls the highest moral </p>
<p>ideals of the Torah but owes its energy and impetus to Jesus and not to the </p>
<p>letter of the law. In keeping with the central thesis or rhetorical propositio </p>
<p>of Col 1:15–20, the exhortation is highly christocentric.</p>
