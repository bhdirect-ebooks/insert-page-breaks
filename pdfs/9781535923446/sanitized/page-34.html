<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>law as it stands as a threat to the integrity of Jesus-believing Gentiles and </p>
<p>involves a devaluing of the preeminence of the Messiah.</p>
<p>But what type of Judaism was Paul engaging? A hybrid Jewish </p>
<p>Gnosticism could be conceivable if Colossians was written late in the rst </p>
<p>century or in the early second century.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>Yet Colossians was not likely to</p>
<p>have been composed so late, and the philosophy lacks the anti-cosmic </p>
<p>dualism that was at the root of Gnosticism whereby the creation of the </p>
<p>material world is attributed to the act of a malevolent demiurge. Over </p>
<p>a hundred years ago J. B. Lightfoot suggested that the “heresy” had an </p>
<p>anity with Essenism and Gnosticism since the Essenes had a tendency </p>
<p>towards mysticism.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>e discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, arguably</p>
<p>stemming from an Essene sect, provided further grounds for links be-</p>
<p>tween the Colossian philosophy and the Essenes. Pierre Benoit writes, “A </p>
<p>return to the Mosaic law by circumcision, rigid observance concerning </p>
<p>diet and the calendar, speculations about the angelic powers: all this is </p>
<p>part and parcel of the doctrines of Qumran.”</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>e parallels between the</p>
<p>philosophy and Josephus’s account of the Essenes and with selected por-</p>
<p>tions of the Qumran scrolls are undeniable. However, there remains the </p>
<p>absence of any evidence that the Essenes were in Phrygia or the Lycus </p>
<p>Valley. e asceticism and mysticism of the philosophy could also com-</p>
<p>port with a number of other Jewish religious strains, including merkabah </p>
<p>mystics or apocalyptic sects.</p>
<p>I want to suggest, in line with a number of researchers, that the </p>
<p>background to the philosophy lies in Jewish mysticism.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>First, F. F. Bruce</p>
<p>noted the anities of the Colossian philosophy with merkabah mysti-</p>
<p>cism.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>Merkabah mysticism was a Jewish movement that got its name</p>
<p>from its concern with visions of the heavenly chariot (mrkbh) that was </p>
<p>with God during Ezekiel’s glorious vision (Ezek 1:4–28). Visions of God’s </p>
<p>throne and angelic worship were granted to those who undertook rigor-</p>
<p>ous adherence to the Mosaic law with periods of asceticism and purica-</p>
