<p>Engaging the Empty Deceit of Mystic Judaism</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>inconsistent with faith in the Messiah. e rst injunction is that they not </p>
<p>be taken captive by philosophy and empty deceit, where the philosophy </p>
<p>is depicted as intellectually void in content and devious in nature (see 1 </p>
<p>Cor 3:18; Eph 5:6). Interestingly, the word for captive (sulagōgeō) sounds </p>
<p>remarkably similar to the word for “synagogue” (synagōgē) with perhaps </p>
<p>a deliberate play on words.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>is would underscore, albeit obliquely, the</p>
<p>Jewish nature of the philosophy being commended to the Colossian </p>
<p>Christians. In other words, Paul implies, do not let yourself be captured, </p>
<p>kidnapped, and dragged o by the local synagogue for indoctrination.</p>
<p>e failings of the philosophy are then explained further. First, it is </p>
<p>according to human tradition, which was a common Christian jibe at </p>
<p>certain Jewish expansive interpretations of the Torah, i.e., specic sugges-</p>
<p>tions as to what it means to obey the law of Moses (see Mark 7:8; Gal 1:14). </p>
<p>What is being proscribed is perhaps a feature of Jewish halakah, or tradi-</p>
<p>tions of interpretation and application pertaining to the Old Testament </p>
<p>regulations passed on by Jewish religious leaders (which makes sense </p>
<p>of the prescriptions about holy days and prohibited foods in 2:16, 21).</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ese prescribed practices demand stringent adherence to a rigid set of </p>
<p>teachings that aims to ensure complete obedience to God. Yet Paul objects </p>
<p>to Gentile Christians having their freedom curtailed by Torah and its ac-</p>
<p>companying interpretation by religious groups in Colossae. In the words </p>
<p>of Andrew Lincoln: “For Colossians the gospel is grace, and no response </p>
<p>to it can depart from the foundation by adding human achievements as </p>
<p>a requirement. Instead, authentic Christian living is motivated by a re-</p>
<p>sponse to and empowered by an appropriation of the undeserved favor </p>
<p>of God in Christ.”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Second, the philosophy is according to the elemental</p>
<p>forces of the cosmos, or perhaps, “accords with certain principalities </p>
<p>and powers.” e identity of the elemental forces (stoicheia) is somewhat </p>
<p>debatable (see Gal 4:3, 9). ey can refer to the basic principles of some-</p>
<p>not infer here, as Dunn (1996: 146) does, that the use of the future tense (estai, “it will </p>
<p>be”) suggests a “possibility” as opposed to a “current state of aairs.” See in contrast </p>
<p>Lightfoot 1879: 178; Abbott 1897: 246; Lincoln 2000: 662; McL. Wilson 2005: 194.</p>

<p>4. We should note, however, that Greek philosophy could also talk about handing on </p>
<p>traditions (see Lohse 1971: 95 n. 24). Arnold (1996: 188, 204–10) points out that magi-</p>
<p>cal incantations could also be described as “traditions” too. Arnold’s attempt to press </p>
<p>“wisdom,” “philosophy,” and “tradition” into the aid of a magical background seems too </p>
<p>forced.</p>
