<p>Colossians 4:2–6</p>

<p>Paul turns to the community’s responsibility to further this mis-</p>
<p>sion in their own midst. Notably, he does not call upon them to emulate </p>
<p>strictly in a local context the task that he has to herald the gospel. Not </p>
<p>everyone is called to be an apostle or evangelist. ey are to be wise in </p>
<p>the world, gracious in speech, and ready to answer about their faith. First, </p>
<p>at several points Paul has something to say about their walk before the </p>
<p>Lord (1:10; 2:6) and here it is a matter of their daily life before outsiders. </p>
<p>Christianity is not a private religion lived in the interiorized safety of the </p>
<p>mind, but is lived in partnership with other believers in the public sphere. </p>
<p>We have already seen that the household code in 3:18—4:1 is probably </p>
<p>given to help the Colossian households order themselves so as to avoid </p>
<p>accusation that they are anti-social radicals. at was something that was </p>
<p>quite possible given the situation in First Corinthians where excessive </p>
<p>spiritual enthusiasm seems to have overpowered all sense of order, as well </p>
<p>as in Gnostic exegesis of Gal 3:28/Col 3:11, which took Paul’s remarks </p>
<p>in a radical direction and eradicated all social and gender distinctions </p>
<p>through a hyper-Platonic anthropology. To walk wisely requires giving </p>
<p>no reason for insult, doing good to win the favor of others, and living in </p>
<p>such a way as to attract praise and positive curiosity (similarly, see e.g., </p>
<p>1 Cor 10:32–33; Phil 2:14–16). is is redeeming the time or making </p>
<p>the most of their opportunities in the situation that they are in for the </p>
<p>gospel. Obedience is not an end in itself, but is for the benet of outsiders, </p>
<p>those that have not received the word of the Messiah.</p>

<p>Second, Paul adds</p>
<p>let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, which builds on </p>
<p>both Jewish and Hellenistic wisdom traditions about the use of speech. </p>
<p>Similar statements can be found elsewhere in the New Testament, espe-</p>
<p>cially in Eph 4:29 and 5:4 about avoiding vulgar conversation and in Jas </p>
<p>3:2–12 concerning use and abuse of the tongue. A godly walk must be </p>
<p>accompanied by godly talk. ird, this instruction is given so that you </p>
<p>may know how you ought to answer every one and this presupposes </p>
<p>a willingness and opportunity to expound one’s faith and beliefs before </p>
<p>others (see 1 Pet 3:15–16). A wise and God-centered pattern of life with </p>
<p>characteristic speech pervaded with graciousness provides the means </p>
<p>by which they nd opportunities to answer outsiders who ask genuine </p>
<p>questions about their faith. Whereas Paul is very much involved in active </p>
<p>proclamation, he envisages the Colossians exhibiting an attractive pres-</p>
