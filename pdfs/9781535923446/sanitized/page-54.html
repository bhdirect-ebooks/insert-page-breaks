<p>Colossians 1:3–8</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>phy, which are said to consist of empty deceit and human tradition (2:8). </p>
<p>Moreover, much like the word of God in the Psalms (e.g., Ps 119:43), the </p>
<p>word of the gospel is true and trustworthy. e epistle to the Colossians </p>
<p>as a whole is “word” centered as evidenced by reference to the word of </p>
<p>God, the word of Christ, and the word of evangelistic preaching (1:25; </p>
<p>3:16; 4:3). e Colossians are invited to see their own lives as part of the </p>
<p>story of the gospel as viewed through their experience of deliverance and </p>
<p>in their expression of faithfulness to the Messiah.</p>
<p>Paul then shis his view to a wider horizon in the spread of the gos-</p>
<p>pel in the worldwide theater. Paul says that in all the world the gospel is </p>
<p>bearing fruit and growing. at is to say, the word of the gospel is being </p>
<p>heard and garnering adherents across various political, ethnic, and ter-</p>
<p>ritorial borders. e language here probably alludes to Gen 1:28 where </p>
<p>Adam and Eve were to “Be fruitful and multiply and ll the earth.” Taken </p>
<p>up here, the progeny of Jesus, the new Adam, are doing just that, and </p>
<p>obedience to God’s gospel-word is the means by which the old world is </p>
<p>colonized by the new humanity of the new creation (see 1:10).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>We can</p>
<p>also see here a possible allusion to Isa 27:6, which says, “In days to come </p>
<p>Jacob shall take root, Israel shall blossom and put forth shoots and ll the </p>
<p>whole world with fruit” (esv). e great redemption of Israel that Isaiah </p>
<p>predicted with its replanting of Israel produces an abundance of fruit that </p>
<p>grows into the entire world. So too does the redemption in Messiah Jesus </p>
<p>and the calling of the church to be Israel-for-the-sake-of-the-world bring </p>
<p>forth a fruit basket of blessings that covers the earth.</p>
<p>e ideas here are made emphatic by the repetition of just as </p>
<p>(kathōs). Just as the gospel came to the Colossians, so too has it come to </p>
<p>others in the wider Greco-Roman world. Whereas biblical scholarship </p>
<p>has tended to think of Christian communities as somewhat isolated and </p>
<p>introspective entities, in actuality, the circulation of written materials and </p>
<p>the travel itineraries of the early Christians suggest that they had a sense </p>
<p>of being a worldwide movement and were very much in close and con-</p>
<p>stant contact with one another.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>It is reception and continued adherence</p>
<p>to the gospel which will ensure that the Colossians remain in communion </p>
<p>with a wider body of believers. It is their instruction from Epaphras that </p>
<p>10. Beale (2007: 846) regards Paul’s usage here as “typological” as “the continued fail-</p>
<p>ure to fulll the Genesis commission pointed to an eschatological humanity that would </p>
<p>nally be obedient to the Genesis command.”</p>
