<p>Fusing the Horizons: Ministerial Formation</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>1. The Ministry of Reconciliation. Central to Paul’s theology is the motif </p>
<p>of reconciliation.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Indeed, some have even argued that this is the central</p>
<p>and controlling theme of Pauline theology as a whole.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Paul considered his</p>
<p>ministry as one of reconciliation (2 Cor 5:18–19), focusing on the breaking </p>
<p>down of the sin barrier between God and humanity through the sacriﬁcial </p>
<p>death of the Son of God. Paul also saw the barriers between Jews and Gentiles </p>
<p>being broken down by the gospel (e.g., Eph 2:14) and could often plead for </p>
<p>reconciliation between warring members of Christian congregations (e.g., Phil </p>
<p>4:3). Christians can and should be agents of reconciliation in their ecclesial </p>
<p>and social contexts. A large feature of pastoral ministry is the acting out of </p>
<p>the message of reconciliation in a community setting. Christians, after all, are </p>
<p>called to be peacemakers (Matt 5:9). While not everyone is called to effect </p>
<p>reconciliation in places such as post-apartheid South Africa, Northern Ireland, </p>
<p>or amidst sectarian violence within the Middle East, still, all Christians are </p>
<p>called to promote peace with other human beings and the hope of peace with </p>
<p>God through the gospel of Jesus Christ. Since we have been comforted we can </p>
<p>comfort others (2 Cor 1:4) and because we have been reconciled to God we </p>
<p>can be agents of reconciliation in our churches and in our communities. The </p>
<p>act of reconciliation itself can have far reaching effects for society, as Barth </p>
<p>and Blanke comment:</p>
<p>According to Paul’s best-known letters, every person, whether Jew </p>
<p>or Gentile, needs forgiveness of sins, salvation by Christ’s blood </p>
<p>rather than self-salvation by the misunderstood and misused law </p>
<p>of God, and redemption from eternal death. For everyone the spiri-</p>
<p>tual freedom has immediate consequences in the social setting of </p>
<p>his or her own life. But Philem 16 makes it explicit that salvation </p>
and redemption, freedom and equality are divine gifts far too pre-
<p>cious to be left to the handling of even so good a Christian and </p>
<p>so legal a slave owner as Philemon. When this man receives and </p>
<p>treats Onesimus as a brother he receives, according to verse 17, a </p>
<p>person “sent back” (v. 12) by Paul who is to be received the same </p>
<p>way as the apostle hopes to be received. Not only brother Paul but </p>
<p>also brother Onesimus will have to show and tell brother Philemon </p>
<p>a few things relevant to faith and life, and the latter will have to </p>
<p>listen to and follow good advice and proposals. If this be applied to </p>
<p>twentieth-century conditions, it means that professional philoso-</p>
