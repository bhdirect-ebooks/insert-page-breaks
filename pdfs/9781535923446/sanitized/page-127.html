<p>Christian Houses in Pagan Cities</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>women household heads such as Chloe in 1 Cor 1:11 and Phoebe in Rom </p>
<p>16:1–2). ese instructions are addressed to them.</p>
<p>A “household” was more than a domestic dwelling but included the </p>
<p>pater familias or “head of the house,” his wife, children, extended family, </p>
<p>slaves, employees, retainers, and oen other clientele like political sup-</p>
<p>porters. e Christian household codes (Haustafeln) represent teaching </p>
<p>addressed to the various members of a household (see Eph 5.:22–33; 1 </p>
<p>Pet 2:18—3:7; cf. 1 Tim 2:1–15; 5:1–2; 6:1–2, 17–19; Titus 2:1—3:8; Did. </p>
<p>4:9–11; Barn. 19:5–7; 1 Clem. 1:3—2:1; 21:3–9). ey are typied by list-</p>
<p>ing members in binary pairs of husbands/wives, parents/children, and </p>
<p>masters/slaves and then dening the mutual relations between the pairs </p>
<p>usually in terms of obedience and submission. ese codes are most likely </p>
<p>derived from Aristotlean or Stoic ethical precepts for the governance of </p>
<p>relationships within a household, which were subsequently appropri-</p>
<p>ated by Hellenistic Jewish authors (e.g., Aristotle Politics 1.5; Dionysius </p>
<p>of Halicarnassus Ant. rom. 2.24–27; Seneca Ep. 94.1; and in Hellenistic </p>
<p>Judaism, e.g., Philo Hypoth. 7.1–9; Decal. 165–67; Josephus Ag. Ap. </p>
<p>2.190–219; Ps.-Phocylides 175–227). A key dierence is that whereas </p>
<p>the Stoics drew up their household management lists according to the </p>
<p>“law of nature,” Paul’s are clearly patterned aer the “law of Messiah” (Gal </p>
<p>6:2) and the “new nature” (Col 3:10).</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Not everyone particularly likes the</p>
<p>Christian household codes. Some feminist scholars regard them as patri-</p>
<p>archal and oppressive and oen posit “histories” as to how the egalitarian </p>
<p>religion of Jesus and Paul was supplanted by the hierarchical and androg-</p>
<p>ynous designs of post-Pauline disciples who wrote the household codes </p>
<p>as a means of putting women in their place.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Schüssler Fiorenza states:</p>
<p>“Colossians shows how a so-called ‘enthusiastic’ realized eschatological </p>
<p>perspective can produce an insistence on patriarchal behaviour as well as </p>
<p>an acceptance of the established political-social status quo of inequality </p>
<p>and exploitation in the name of Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Schweizer regards them as</p>
<p>a “paganizing” of Christian ethics, and Barclay stoically comments that, </p>
<p>“for better or worse, the code represents a christianization of traditional </p>
<p>rulings on household relationships.”</p>
