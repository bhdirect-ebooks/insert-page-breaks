<p>Colossians 4:7–18</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>e penultimate exhortation pertains to Archippus who appears to </p>
<p>have been a leader of some group possibly linked to the house of Philemon </p>
<p>(see Phlm 2, where he is called a “fellow soldier”). e remark is not ad-</p>
<p>dressed to him personally, instead it is given to the Colossians in general: </p>
<p>Say to Archippus, “See to it that you full the ministry which you have </p>
<p>received in the Lord.” Notably, the word for Say is in the plural and the </p>
<p>believers are corporately to encourage Archippus to fulll his ministry as </p>
<p>something exercised in the sphere of the Lord’s authority. What that min-</p>
<p>istry exactly was, is not stated. It could be to preach, teach, or relate to the </p>
<p>collection for the Jerusalem church. What I nd plausible is the suggestion </p>
<p>that it refers to Archippus taking Epaphras’s place, but that is admittedly </p>
<p>conjectural.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Whatever his “service” was, Archippus is either struggling or</p>
<p>in need of encouragement. If he remains one of the few “pastoral” leaders </p>
<p>in the churches, his lot might not be a pleasant one in having to contend </p>
<p>with the aermath of the Philemon/Onesimus incident, coping with the </p>
<p>absence of Epaphras, dealing with the philosophy when still himself a </p>
<p>“young” believer, and now facing the presence of Tychicus and Onesimus </p>
<p>(and perhaps even John Mark still to come) who may usurp or upstage </p>
<p>his own status and position within the churches in the Lycus Valley. One </p>
<p>must wonder if behind these statements there lies an element of “pastoral </p>
<p>politics,” as Archippus has not handled the situation in Colossae well, re-</p>
<p>sulting in Paul and his coworkers feeling the need to write them a letter </p>
<p>exhorting them quite forcefully on certain matters, reminding them of </p>
<p>Epaphras’s legacy, and parachuting in a cohort of Pauline coworkers to do </p>
<p>any necessary triage in the Lycus Valley. en again, perhaps Archippus </p>
<p>himself called for assistance. Either way this last statement is an arma-</p>
<p>tion of Archippus’s service and a recognition of his place in the leadership </p>
<p>of the Colossian church.</p>
<p>planks in his argument: (1) Archippus was a deacon in Colossae, while Philemon lived </p>
<p>in Laodicea; (2) it was Archippus rather than Philemon who was the slave owner of </p>
<p>Onesimus; (3) the letter to the Laodiceans is this letter to Philemon; (4) the purpose of </p>
<p>the letter to Philemon is to force Archippus, through Philemon’s personal inuence, to </p>
<p>release Onesimus so that he might in the future work with Paul; and (5) Onesimus was </p>
<p>nally manumitted and eventually became bishop of Ephesus. See criticisms of Knox’s </p>
<p>argument in Fitzmyer 2000: 14–17.</p>
<p>9. Calvin 1979a: 231; Gnilka 1980: 246; Fitzmyer 2000: 88 (citing Caird and </p>
<p>Lohmeyer). In Apostolic Constitutions 7.46 Archippus is mentioned as a one time bishop </p>
<p>of Laodicea, Jerome thinks him bishop of Colossae, Chrysostom has him as one of the </p>
<p>clergy, and Pelagius thinks him a deacon (Gorday 2000: 311).</p>
