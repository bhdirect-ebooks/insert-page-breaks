<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>Onesimus’s period of respite and sanctuary with Paul, he was converted </p>
<p>to Christian faith (v. 10). Why he had not converted earlier as part of </p>
<p>Philemon’s household is a good question but one we cannot answer.</p>
<p>What is the situation behind the letter? ere are several options to </p>
<p>consider.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>First, there is the traditional view that Onesimus had simply</p>
<p>run away from Philemon most probably because he had damaged goods </p>
<p>or stolen something leaving his master Philemon out of pocket (vv. 11, </p>
<p>18). Onesimus then sought shelter with Paul, a respected friend of the </p>
<p>master, and Paul pleads to Philemon to forgive Onesimus his transgres-</p>
<p>sion and hopefully allow him to remain in Paul’s retinue. But there are </p>
<p>further factors for consideration that might count against this proposal, </p>
<p>such as the observation that Paul never uses the words phygas, draptēs, or </p>
<p>fugitivus as terms to describe Onesimus as a slave taken to ight. Nor does </p>
<p>he ever refer to the dire punishments that await a returned fugitive slave. </p>
<p>Normally runaways try to vanish, so why would a runaway slave ee to </p>
<p>his master’s friend and run the risk of being turned over to authorities? </p>
<p>Maybe Onesimus had a change of mind or knew that his capture was im-</p>
<p>minent, but these are speculations to account for the fact that a runaway </p>
<p>slave is now in the company of a friend of his master. Moreover, nowhere </p>
<p>in the letter is the precise reason for Onesimus’s sudden departure ever </p>
<p>given, and running away is only one possibility, which is more ordinarily </p>
<p>assumed than proven.</p>
<p>A second option is that Onesimus is not a runaway slave, but is </p>
<p>rather a slave who is in some measure of domestic trouble with his master </p>
<p>and seeks the intervention of an amicus domini (friend of the master) </p>
<p>to intercede for him in hope of being restored back to favored status in </p>
<p>Philemon’s household. In this sense, the letter to Philemon is roughly </p>
<p>analogous to the letter that Pliny the Younger sent to Sabinus to intercede </p>
<p>on behalf of a freedman to his master.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>91. Cf. Fitzmyer 2000: 17–24.</p>
<p>92. Pliny Ep. 9.21: “To Sabianus. e freedman of yours with whom you said you </p>
<p>were angry has been to me, ung himself at my feet, and clung to me as if I were you. </p>
<p>He begged my help with many tears, though he le a good deal unsaid; in short, he </p>
<p>convinced me of his genuine penitence. I believe he has reformed, because he realizes </p>
<p>that he did wrong. You are angry, I know, and I know too that your anger was deserved, </p>
<p>but mercy wins most praise when there was just cause for anger. You loved the man once, </p>
<p>and I hope you will love again, but it is sucient for the moment if you allow yourself to </p>
<p>be appeased. You can always be angry again if he deserves it, and will have more excuse </p>
<p>if you were once placated. Make some concession to his youth, his tears and your own </p>
