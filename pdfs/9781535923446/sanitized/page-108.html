<p>transfOrmed and renewed: </p>
<p>New Creation and the New Life (3:1–17)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>If then you have been raised with Messiah, seek the things</p>
<p>above where Messiah is, enthroned at the right hand of God. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Set your minds on the things above and not on the things of</p>
<p>earth. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>For you have died and your life has been hidden with</p>
<p>Messiah in God. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p> When Messiah, who is your life, is mani-</p>
<p>fested, then you also will be manifested with him in glory.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>erefore, put to death the members of your earthly</p>
<p>being, sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, and </p>
<p>greed, which is idolatry. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Because of which the wrath of God</p>
<p>is coming upon the sons of disobedience </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>and you formerly</p>
<p>walked in them when you lived in these things. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>But now</p>
<p>you must also put o all such things, anger, wrath, malice, </p>
<p>slander, and perverse talk from your mouth. </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Do not lie to</p>
<p>one another, (because you) have stripped o the old man with </p>
<p>its deeds </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>and having clothed yourselves with the new man,</p>
<p>which is being renewed according to the image of the one </p>
<p>creating him. </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>In that renewal there is no longer Greek and</p>
<p>Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, Barbarian, Scythian, </p>
<p>slave, and free; but Messiah is for all and in all.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>erefore, as God’s elect, holy and beloved, clothe</p>
<p>yourselves with hearts of compassion, kindness, humility, </p>
<p>meekness, and patience. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Bearing with one another, and if</p>
<p>anyone has a complaint against someone, forgive each other </p>
<p>just as the Lord graciously forgave you, and thus so with you </p>
<p>too. </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>And to all these virtues add love, which is the bond</p>
<p>of perfect unity. </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>And let the peace of Messiah arbitrate in</p>
<p>your hearts, into which you were called in one body—and so </p>
<p>be thankful. </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Let the word of Messiah dwell in you richly,</p>
