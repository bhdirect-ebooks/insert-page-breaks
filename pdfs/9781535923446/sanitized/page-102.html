<p>Colossians 2:16–23</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>the Colossian community and this action is inconsistent with the pattern </p>
<p>of teaching that they have received. e regulations in question relate </p>
<p>primarily to abstinence, separation, and the maintenance of purity, which </p>
<p>are typical concerns of Jewish communities living in pagan majority envi-</p>
<p>ronments. Hence, the triadic commandments which Paul derides: do not </p>
<p>handle, do not taste, do not touch, and this may be a slogan of the teach-</p>
<p>ers in Colossae themselves that Paul negatively repeats. e regulations </p>
<p>(see 2:14) are described as commandments, which Paul uses to describe </p>
<p>the Torah elsewhere (e.g., Rom 7:8–13), and as teachings of men, which </p>
<p>most likely denotes interpretation and application of the Torah.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>In other</p>
<p>words, in an argument very much akin to Gal 4:8–10, Paul is saying that </p>
<p>submission to Torah + mysticism involving angels means being in bond-</p>
<p>age to powers opposed to human beings. e Torah may have been given </p>
<p>to Moses by angels (Gal 3:19), but obeying it will not appease the angels </p>
<p>as much as enslave believers to them. Just as they died to the law (Gal </p>
<p>2:19; Rom 7:4) so too they have died to the angelic beings who gave it. </p>
<p>Subservience to angelic powers is singularly inappropriate because the </p>
<p>Colossians themselves are raised and seated with Messiah (2:12; 3:1–2) </p>
<p>and, in a particular sense, are not living in this world. Furthermore, in </p>
<p>a side remark, Paul says that these restrictive regulations are themselves </p>
<p>unimportant because they perish as they are used up, and so, the mate-</p>
<p>rial things of the world become immaterial in light of the cross and resur-</p>
<p>rection. us, Paul counters a theology of purity and pollution with one </p>
<p>of new creation and the cross. Paul counters a philosophy with Platonic </p>
<p>overtones by using a Platonic argument about the dierence between </p>
<p>ideal and reality rooted in a theology of the incarnation and a redemptive </p>
<p>historical scheme of promise and fulllment.</p>
<p>In a further remark, Paul states that the philosophy of the teachers </p>
<p>may have an outward appearance of providing a path to wisdom, but in </p>
<p>reality, it is a form of pseudo-piety or “man-made religion” (see “self-</p>
<p>made religion” [esv, nasb]; “self-imposed worship” [niv]; “self-imposed </p>
<p>piety” [nrsv]). e mandated ascetic practices and harsh treatment of </p>
<p>the body, acts of self-deprivation, do not attain the goals to which they re-</p>
<p>portedly claim and thus have no value. For Paul, restraining the gratica-</p>
<p>tions of the esh is not achieved by Torah, which antagonizes rather than </p>
<p>41. e words “commandments” (entalamata) and “teachings” (didaskalia) are also </p>
<p>found in Matt 15:9, Mark 7:7, and Isa 29:13 lxx.</p>
