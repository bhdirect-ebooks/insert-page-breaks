<p>Colossians 4:2–18</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>mately bound up with the gospel of the mystery of the Messiah. Put this </p>
<p>way, their agreement with the gospel is required in order to uphold the </p>
<p>honor ascribed to them by Paul and to reinforce the mutual aections </p>
<p>between them.</p>
<p>Viewed from this perspective, it is possible to see how the closing </p>
<p>section relates to the risk posed by the philosophy. It comes down not just </p>
<p>to a matter of “what do you believe?” but “to whom do you belong?” If </p>
<p>they believe in the Messiah, then they belong to the Messiah and to the </p>
<p>communities (like those associated with Paul) that proclaim him and live </p>
<p>obediently before him. e Colossians are treated as benefactors, sup-</p>
<p>porters, and partners in the kingdom of God, but they will bring shame </p>
<p>on themselves if they do not act accordingly or if they embrace the phi-</p>
<p>losophy with its diminishment of the status of Messiah Jesus. What is </p>
<p>more, the reference to the circumcision in 4:11 is perhaps an indirect </p>
<p>jibe at the teachers and a further indication of the philosophy’s links to </p>
<p>local synagogues.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> Paul, though himself a Jew, has had relatively little as-</p>
<p>sistance in his endeavors from Jews not believing in Jesus (see 1 ess </p>
<p>2:15). Persons such as Jesus called Justus and Timothy are invaluable to </p>
<p>Paul’s service, but they are the exceptions. us the Colossians should </p>
<p>not think that allying themselves to the local synagogue will necessarily </p>
<p>translate into joint endeavors in kingdom work; the realities from Paul’s </p>
<p>own experience have proven otherwise.</p>
<p>Prayer, Proclamation, and Walking in Wisdom (4:2–6)</p>
<p>Aer establishing the nature of relations in Christian households (largely </p>
<p>to oset allegations that Christians are anti-social radicals), Paul proceeds </p>
<p>to exhort the Colossians in the life of faithfulness that he has already </p>
<p>spoken of (1:4; 2:5). ey are to continue on in prayer, in the sense of </p>
<p>persistent dedication to the discipline of its practice (see Acts 1:14; 6:4; </p>
<p>Rom 12:12). e verb proskartereō is an imperative and plural; it is a </p>
<p>corporate command to the entire Colossian community to be devoted </p>
<p>to prayer. Communal prayer is a means of being watchful by ensuring </p>
<p>vigilant readiness in times of grave danger, and it means keeping one’s </p>
<p>spiritual eyes open. Prayer is also to be oered with thanksgiving, which </p>
<p>Paul himself models in Colossians (1:3–14) and Philemon (4–5). Even </p>
