<p>Engaging the Empty Deceit of Mystic Judaism</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>14:37). e visions are not a means to edify others, but become a vehicle </p>
<p>for pressing one’s own claim to worth and value in a religious association. </p>
<p>Paul can speak of his own visionary experiences (2 Cor 12:2–7), but he </p>
<p>did not see it as a means of boasting or self-promotion, which is the exact </p>
<p>opposite of those who are pued up. e teachers become self-inated, </p>
<p>conceited (on physioō see 1 Cor 4:6, 18–19; 5:2; 8:1; 13:4), and possess a </p>
<p>eshly mind driven by the carnality of human existence as opposed to a </p>
<p>mind nurtured by the praises of the heavenlies as is claimed.</p>
<p>A further polemical description pertains to those who are not grasp-</p>
<p>ing the head. Here head is an obvious reference to Jesus (1:18; 2:10), but </p>
<p>the failure to grasp Jesus Christ could lie with one or more groups. is </p>
<p>could conceivably mean that some believers in Colossae, already inu-</p>
<p>enced by the philosophy, fail to comprehend the full account of their </p>
<p>riches in Messiah and fail to apprehend the fullness of God in the Messiah. </p>
<p>Or else, and more probable, it signies that the teachers external to the </p>
<p>community simply do not “get it,” or do not register the reality of Jesus’s </p>
<p>identity and authority.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>Paul proceeds to use a body metaphor (see Rom</p>
<p>12:4; 1 Cor 12:12–31) to refer to Jesus as the one from whom the body is </p>
<p>nourished and united together. e quest for a maturity and growth that </p>
<p>comes from God is ultimately attained only in the Messiah.</p>
<p>Paul briey recaps the nature of his discourse so far. Whereas he has </p>
<p>moved largely from the indicative (i.e., burial and resurrection with the </p>
<p>Messiah, vv. 8–15) to the imperative (i.e., do not surrender your freedom, </p>
<p>vv. 16–18), he works here from the indicative to an interrogative in order </p>
<p>to press his point with greater rhetorical eect. e conditional clause </p>
<p>if you died with the Messiah expresses the reality of vv. 12–13 and not </p>
<p>doubt.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> e elemental forces are the hostile angelic beings of the heav-</p>
<p>enly realm, which, as made known in 2:15, Jesus has gloriously triumphed </p>
<p>over. Yet if this is the case, Paul legitimately asks, why, as if you were liv-</p>
<p>ing in the world, do you continue to submit to its regulations? is is </p>
<p>the rst clear instance that the philosophy has made some headway into </p>
<p>39. Barth and Blanke (1994: 385–87) suppose that the teachers represent persons </p>
<p>who are outside of the Colossian community, but nonetheless perceive themselves as </p>
<p>Christians with an exclusively elitist self-concept, which is expressed in various Jewish </p>
<p>ordinances and which they are attempting to make obligatory for the church in general. </p>
<p>For me that description corresponds more closely to the opponents in Galatians rather </p>
<p>than in Colossians.</p>
