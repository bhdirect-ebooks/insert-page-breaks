<p>Colossians 1:28—2:3</p>

<p>Paul unites these two entities in Jesus.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Paradoxically, this knowledge is</p>
<p>hidden and yet also unraveled in the Messiah, as he embodies the wis-</p>
<p>dom and secret things of God.</p>
<p>Exhortation to Faithfulness in the Messiah (2:4–7)</p>
<p>Although Paul has already intimated his exhortation and warning at ear-</p>
<p>lier points, he begins his rst formal exhortatory section here. is section </p>
<p>in Col 2:4–7 rounds o Col 1:1—2:3 and more closely relates to what has </p>
<p>gone before than to what follows. It functions like a conplexio that briey </p>
<p>recaps the argument up to this point. e apostle and his coauthor deni-</p>
<p>grate the philosophy further by their remarks and urge faithfulness and </p>
<p>continuance in the pattern of teaching that the Colossians rst received. </p>
<p>e undergirding principle is to hold on to that which accords with the </p>
<p>image and power of the Messiah as explicated in the poem of 1:15–20.</p>
<p>Paul relates this, that is, what has just been written or read out per-</p>
<p>taining to the suciency and supremacy of the Messiah for the Colossians, </p>
<p>in order that no one might deceive you with persuasive arguments. e </p>
<p>obvious impression is that Paul is reproong the Colossians against </p>
<p>perceived error. e philosophy has not gained a foothold yet, but Paul </p>
<p>and his coworkers are intent on preventing any further encroachment.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>ese persuasive arguments (pithanologia, see “ne-sounding” [niv], </p>
<p>“plausible” [nrsv; esv], “specious” [njb]) refer to views and practices that </p>
<p>sound attractive and alluring, but in fact adherence to them removes the </p>
<p>Colossians from their root and foundation in the Messiah. While Paul is </p>
<p>absent in person, he is there in spirit. He is present with them because </p>
<p>both he and they live in Messiah and share in the Spirit of God. Paul </p>
<p>wants to see (or hear about) the Colossians’ endurance, steadfastness, and </p>
<p>faithfulness in the Messiah (see Col 1:4, 11, 23). e words for orderli-</p>

<p>tions, but also in military terminology for fortications (e.g., Xenophon </p>
<p>Anab. 1.2.18). Taking this latter sense, the imagery is of preparedness for </p>
<p>conict and of loyalty to one’s commander. Paul’s inferential erefore </p>
<p>begins the assigned imperative that follows. eir delity to what they re-</p>
<p>ceived about the Messiah Jesus the Lord is a model for how they are now </p>
