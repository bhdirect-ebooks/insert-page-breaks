<p>Letter Opening and Greeting</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Paul does not address the letter to the “churches” in the designated </p>
<p>region as he does elsewhere (e.g., Corinth [1 Cor 1:2; 2 Cor 1:1]; Galatia </p>
<p>[Gal 1:1]; essalonica [1 ess 1:1; 2 ess 1:1]), yet this is hardly sig-</p>
<p>nicant since he does not mention any particular “church” in the opening </p>
<p>prescript of Romans, Philippians, or Ephesians either. For Paul, the fact </p>
<p>that the gospel had spread to Colossae and the fact that they had been </p>
<p>baptized into the Messiah is proof enough of the existence of an ekklēsia </p>
<p>(“church”) in Colossae. He describes them as holy and faithful. I have </p>
<p>chosen to take hagioi (“saints” or “holy”) adjectivally with faithful, which </p>
<p>modies brothers and sisters (on translating adelphos in this inclusive </p>
<p>way see also net, tniv, nrsv, nlt).</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>e Colossians are, by reality and</p>
<p>ideal, the holy and faithful people of God rooted in the Messiah. Holiness </p>
<p>and delity describes their current state as those who are in Messiah, but it </p>
<p>also designates the goal of their conduct as those who seek to live worthily </p>
<p>of Messiah (see 1:10). e letter opening rounds up with a greeting of </p>
<p>grace and peace. Paul has replaced the regular Greek chairein (“greeting”) </p>
<p>with charis (“grace,” “favour,” “generosity”) and linked it characteristically </p>
<p>to the Jewish concept of shalom (“peace”), understood as the absence of </p>
<p>hostilities, but also well-being, wholeness, and prosperity. e apostle </p>
greets the Colossians with a blessing of divine favor and divine embrace.
<p>5. Although in other letter prescripts hagioi is used substantively and appropriately </p>
<p>translated as “saints” or “holy ones” (e.g., 1 Cor 1:2), Paul’s only other use of hagioi in </p>
<p>Colossians (3:12) is adjectival. See also Moule 1957: 45.</p>
