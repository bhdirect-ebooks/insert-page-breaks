<p>e Pathos and Persuasion of the Apostle</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>brotherhood was known as an ideal in the Greek world, such a bond be-</p>
<p>tween slaves and masters would have been quite scandalous and viewed </p>
<p>as compromising the household order. Treating slaves humanely was not </p>
<p>unknown in the Greco-Roman world, but regarding them as brothers </p>
<p>would have been viewed as bad for discipline and even self-deprecating </p>
<p>for the master (was he to come down to their level?). Slaves born into the </p>
<p>household might be fathered by the master through a slave woman and </p>
<p>grow up well-educated and cared for alongside legitimate ospring of the </p>
<p>master. Sometimes such children were freed and became heirs with well-</p>
<p>born children in the household, but even so, for most born into captivity </p>
<p>their status as illegitimate slaves would prevent them from ever being </p>
<p>legal and social equals with their genetic brothers and sisters of legitimate </p>
<p>birth. Perhaps Paul shared the same view held by the Essenes who, ac-</p>
<p>cording to Philo, denounced slave ownership as it created enmity rather </p>
<p>than friendship between human brothers.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Paul regards Onesimus as a</p>
<p>son and as a brother and the challenge put to Philemon is whether he will </p>
<p>imitate Paul’s aection towards Onesimus and receive him as a brother.</p>
<p>is appeal, or perhaps better put, this gamble of Paul, is the rhe-</p>
<p>torical fulcrum on which the epistle turns and a positive outcome is not </p>
<p>necessarily assured. How would Philemon respond? He could (1) punish </p>
<p>Onesimus for his wrongdoing, (2) restore him to the household and al-</p>
<p>low him to continue his service as a slave, or (3) manumit Onesimus and </p>
<p>send him back to Paul.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>A mixture of (2) and (3) is what Paul wants. Paul</p>
<p>does everything he can to persuade Philemon to accept Onesimus back </p>
<p>not as a wayward/runaway slave but as a brother in Messiah, while also </p>
<p>intimating his desire to take on Onesimus as a co-worker. e goodness </p>
<p>of Philemon and the utility of Onesimus as viewed through the lens of </p>
<p>the gospel become the primary motivating forces in the apostle’s pastoral </p>
<p>rhetoric.</p>
<p>e intensity of Paul’s plea for Onesimus is ratcheted up in verses </p>
<p>17–22 with two conditional clauses detailing the depth of Paul’s angst </p>
<p>over Onesimus’s welfare, Philemon’s own indebtedness to Paul, and Paul’s </p>
<p>tacit presumption of Philemon’s goodness and hospitality towards him. </p>
<p>In the rst conditional clause, Paul writes: If, then, you have partnership </p>
<p>with me, receive him as you would receive me. Here partnership means </p>
<p>6. Philo Prob. 79.</p>
<p>7. On whether or not Paul makes an implicit plea for Philemon to emancipate </p>
<p>Onesimus, see the discussion in Barth and Blanke 2000: 368–69, 412–15.</p>
