<p>thanksgiving and intercessiOn: </p>
<p>The Prayer of Paul for the Colossians (1:3–14)</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>We always give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord</p>
<p>Jesus Christ for you in prayer, </p>
<p>4</p>
<p> since we heard of your faith-</p>
<p>fulness in Messiah Jesus and the love which you have for </p>
<p>all the saints, </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>because of the hope laid up for you in the</p>
<p>heavenlies, which you rst heard in the word of truth: the </p>
<p>gospel. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>is gospel has come to you just as in all the world</p>
<p>it is bearing fruit and growing, just as among you from the </p>
<p>day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth. </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Just as</p>

<p>a faithful servant of the Messiah on our behalf </p>
<p>8</p>

<p>with complete wisdom and spiritual insight, </p>

<p>worthily of the Lord and pleasing him in every way, bearing </p>
<p>fruit in every good work and growing in the knowledge of </p>
<p>God, </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>being strengthened with all power according to his</p>
<p>glorious might for endurance and patience. With joy, </p>
<p>12</p>
<p> giv-</p>
<p>ing thanks to the Father who qualied you to share in the </p>
<p>inheritance of the saints in the light. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>He delivered us from</p>
<p>the dominion of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom </p>
<p>of the Son of his love, </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>in whom we have redemption, the</p>
<p>forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p>Paul moves beyond his prescript into a rich prayer of thanksgiving and </p>
<p>petition for the Colossians. Central to his prayer is the connection of the </p>
