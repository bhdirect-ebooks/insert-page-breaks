<p>Paul’s Service </p>

<p>ing activity of proclamation, admonition, and instruction. To paraphrase </p>
<p>Markus Barth, to be mature means to cling to the promise of the gospel </p>
<p>with unshakable trust in the Messiah and to cleave to the promise in him </p>
<p>because it is identical to him. ere is no maturing or perfecting other </p>
<p>than that attained through trust in and faithfulness to the Messiah.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Paul then returns again to the umbilical connection between his mission </p>
<p>and the struggles that he faces in the execution of the apostolic vocation. </p>
<p>Paul’s struggle, including absorbing the messianic woes, is a labor that </p>
may seem insurmountable, but is dramatically eective through divine
<p>empowerment. e Greek phrasing in 1:29 is awkward and tautologous, </p>
but it emphatically underscores the ecacy of the divine power that oper-
<p>ates in Paul to achieve its designed purpose. e power (energeia) that </p>
<p>energizes Paul is the same that raised Jesus from the dead (2:12). Paul </p>
<p>prayed earlier that the Colossians would be “strengthened with all power </p>
<p>according to his glorious might,” (1:11) which is an ideal that he embod-</p>
<p>ies for their aspiration and imitation.</p>
<p>For the rst time, Paul mentions the believers in Laodicea and oth-</p>
<p>ers who have not seen him in the esh, which is probably most or all of </p>
<p>the believers in the Lycus Valley. e purpose of this report is not Paul’s </p>
<p>self-adulation, rather, the news of triumph in the face of adversity is given </p>
<p>so that their hearts might be comforted specically by means of being </p>
<p>joined together in love. at is to say, hearing that they are united in the </p>
<p>worldwide movement of the Messiah, bound by a common baptism, shar-</p>
<p>ing a common salvation, united in bonds of aection, and sharing in the </p>
<p>new creation, is a means to comfort their hearts in periods of perplexity. </p>
<p>Encouragement is required in the context of internal wranglings caused </p>
<p>by exposure to Jewish teachers who raise doubts within their ranks about </p>
<p>their assured standing before God. e Colossians possess full assurance </p>
<p>because in their apprehension of the mystery of God they apprehend </p>
<p>the Messiah (see the “mystery of Messiah” in Col 4:3). Precisely in the </p>
<p>Messiah they already have the wisdom and knowledge that they seek or </p>
<p>are told to seek. e same language of knowledge and wisdom is found in </p>
<p>Jewish traditions related to the Torah (4 Macc 1:16–17; Sir 24:1–23; Bar </p>
<p>3:15—4:1; 2 Bar. 44:14; 54:13). is accords with the Jewish nature of the </p>
<p>philosophy that attaches wisdom and knowledge to the Torah, whereas </p>
