<p>e Supremacy of Messiah in Creation and Reconciliation</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>representation of Jesus upon the earth. e church (ekklēsia) here means </p>
<p>the universal church. Jesus is the head of the church, not in the sense of </p>
<p>its source, but as its titular head and leader. While the poem has a high </p>
<p>Christology, it also has a high ecclesiology, as the one who is the creator of </p>
<p>the cosmos is also the head of the church. However disjoined these verses </p>
<p>initially appear to be, they subtly shi the subject matter from creation </p>
<p>(all things are sustained in him) to reconciliation (the church as the body </p>
<p>of people reconciled to God) and so assist in the progression of the poem </p>
<p>to the next subject matter.</p>
<p>The Supremacy of the Messiah in Reconciliation (1:18b–20)</p>
<p>e next strophe of the poem begins with another relative clause, and two </p>
<p>things stand out in juxtaposition here, viz., that Jesus is the beginning </p>
<p>and the rstborn from the dead. e mention of beginning is a fairly </p>
<p>obvious echo of Gen 1:1: “In the beginning . . .” As we saw earlier the </p>
<p>word rstborn in the New Testament is used largely to denote Jesus as the </p>
<p>prototype and provision for God’s renewed humanity. e Jewish hope </p>
<p>of resurrection, though not held uniformly by all devout Jews in the rst </p>
<p>century, looked ahead to the day when God would renew and recreate </p>
<p>the entire world and return it to a period of Edenic goodness. Salvation </p>
<p>is not escape from the created world through the release of an immortal </p>
<p>soul encased in a body (as in Greek philosophy) or the liberation of the </p>
divine spark from its eshly chrysalis (as in Gnosticism), rather salva-
<p>tion consists of the redemption of our bodies to live and abide in God’s </p>
<p>new world (see Rom 8:23). at new creation has kicked o, proleptically </p>
<p>and quite unexpectedly, in the resurrection of Jesus. e resurrection of </p>
<p>Jesus is also signicant christologically because he is raised and exalted </p>
<p>by God in order to rule beside God. It is hardly surprising then that New </p>
<p>Testament references to Jesus as the rstborn or rstfruits of the general </p>
<p>resurrection are bound up with the reign of God over the nations and the </p>
<p>created order (see especially Rev 1:5–7 and 1 Cor 15:20–25).</p>
<p>Paul provides two reasons why God has purposed to launch this </p>
<p>new creation through his Son and what singularly suited him for this </p>
<p>redemptive role. First, God’s plan was that in all things Jesus would </p>
<p>have preeminence; analogous words are “supremacy” (niv, njb) or “rst </p>
<p>one headed by Caesar and the other headed by Jesus.</p>
