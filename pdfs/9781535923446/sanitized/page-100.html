<p>to visionary experiences, angelic visitations, and heavenly ascents. Fasting </p>
<p>leading to ecstatic states may have enabled participants to have, or claim </p>
<p>to have had, visions of angelic worship (e.g., Dan 10:2–3; 4 Ezra 5:13, 20; </p>
<p>Gk. Apoc. Ezra 1:2–7). e worship in question could be worship directed </p>
<p>towards the angels,</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> but more likely worship with the angels.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>e notion</p>
<p>of sharing in the worship oered by angels is part of the great tradition </p>
<p>of Jewish visionary revelations (e.g., Isa 6:2–3; Dan 7:10; Luke 2:14; and </p>
<p>Rev 4–5). e evidence from Qumran suggests that worship with angels </p>
<p>was much coveted, and the Qumranites’ own liturgies were thought to </p>
<p>include the presence of the angels (e.g., 1QH 3:21–22; 11:10–13; 1QM </p>
<p>7:4–6; 1QSa 2:8–9; 1QSb 4:25–26). A plausible scenario, then, is that the </p>
<p>teachers propagated the necessity of ascetic practices leading to visions </p>
<p>of the angelic praises of heaven. is was a means to assuaging, pleasing, </p>
<p>or submitting to the “rulers and authorities” who exercised some form </p>
<p>of inuence over them. is line of argument seems justied in light of </p>
<p>the following statement that the persons urging them to go down this </p>
<p>line describe in detail things which he has purportedly seen on entering </p>
<p>(heaven),</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>vainly being pued up by his eshly mind. What is at stake</p>
<p>is not only the claim to possess special access to the operation of heavenly </p>
<p>liturgy, but the status and prestige that these visions aord to their partici-</p>
<p>pants. e teachers are also seers, and their accounts of visions combined </p>
<p>with the prowess of their instruction invest them with a special authority, </p>
<p>rather like the “spiritual ones” (pneumatikoi) in First Corinthians (3:1; </p>
<p>36. On the worship of angels in Asia Minor see DeMaris 1994: 62; Arnold 1996: 8–</p>
<p>102. Prohibition of angel worship is frequent in various Jewish and Christian writings, </p>
<p>e.g., Deut 4:19; 17:3; Jer 8:2; 19:13; Zeph 1:5; Apoc. Zeph. 6:15; Apoc. Ab. 17:2; Ascen. Isa<span class="_ _2" /><span class="ff2 ls0">. </span></p>
<p>7:21; Rev 19:10; 22:9.</p>
<p>37. Cf. Francis 1975: 176–81; against this interpretation see Lohse 1971: 118–19; </p>
<p>Arnold 1996: 90–95; Lincoln 2000: 563–64.</p>
<p>38. e Greek here is notoriously obscure (esp. the antecedent of the neuter relative </p>
<p>pronoun ha [see BDF § 154]). e meaning of the word embateutō is open to debate, and </p>
<p>some have translated it “entering into,” which could be related to initiation rites in the </p>
<p>mystery cults (e.g., Lohse 1971: 119–21) or “going into detail about” some object of inter-</p>
<p>est (see H. Preisker, TDNT 2:535–36; BDAG 321; tniv). e evidence for the use of the </p>
<p>term in mystery initiations is a century later than Colossians and the word was frequent </p>
<p>in Jewish apocalyptic literature in reference to visionary ascents (Francis 1975: 172–75; </p>
<p>Rowland 1983: 75–76). Most likely embateutō has connotations of entering deeply into </p>
<p>a subject (2 Macc 2:30; Philo Plant. 80). us, at this point it probably means the de-</p>
<p>scriptive report coming from someone who has claimed to enter into heaven (see N. </p>
<p>Walter, EDNT 1:442). See further Evans 1982: 196–98; Sappington 1991: 155–58; Harris </p>
<p>1991: 121–22; Smith 2006: 127–30. </p>
