<p>Paul’s Service </p>
<p>65</p>
<p>suerings of Christ as symbolic in part for the suerings of the church via </p>
<p>the imagery of corporate personality? Let us consider: (1) the context is </p>
<p>dominated by the universal preaching of the gospel and Paul’s unique role </p>
<p>in that task; (2) the word for “aiction” (thlipsis) is never used to describe </p>
<p>the atonement, but it can describe the eschatological ordeal of the future </p>
<p>age (e.g., Matt 24:9, 21, 29; Mark 13:19, 24; 1 Cor 7:28; Rev 7:14); (3) </p>
<p>believers are said to participate in the death of Christ which eectively </p>
<p>transfers them from the old age to the new age and marks their identity </p>
<p>as being “in Messiah” (e.g., Gal 2:19; Rom 6:5, 11; 8:11; Phil 3:10–11; Col </p>
<p>2:12, 20); and (4) the proclamation of the gospel and the advent of the </p>
<p>great apocalyptic tribulation are combined in many places in the New </p>
<p>Testament (e.g., Luke 10:17–21; Matt 24:14; Mark 13:10; Rev 14:6). I </p>
<p>would follow Richard Bauckham by arguing that what we have here is </p>
<p>a Christian reinterpretation of the Jewish idea of a worldwide tribula-</p>
<p>tion, i.e., the “Messianic woes,” occasioned by a growing tide of human </p>
<p>evil before the nal advent of the Messiah. e messianic woes mark the </p>
<p>death throes of an old world ending and the birth pangs of a new world </p>
<p>beginning.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Christians have reinterpreted this idea in light of the passion of Jesus </p>
<p>and the missionary commission of the risen Lord. As the Messiah suf-</p>
<p>fered, so too do his followers suer as they partake of his aictions in </p>
<p>order to partake of his glory (Rom 8:17; 1 Pet 4:13). His followers also </p>
<p>suer persecution and shame for his name as they bear testimony to his </p>
<p>work and person. e two great “not yet” elements of New Testament </p>
<p>eschatology, namely, worldwide gospel mission and universal tribulation, </p>
<p>are drawn together as the church continues its mission and witness under </p>
<p>persecution and opposition.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>e aictions of the nal day belong to the</p>
<p>work of the Messiah, but these are decient insofar as the work of suf-</p>
<p>fering is incomplete because it lasts until the parousia (second coming). </p>
<p>Concerning Paul’s role specically, then, Hannah Stettler writes:</p>
<p>If Paul thought of his ministry as leading to Christ’s parousia, Col </p>
<p>1:24 seems to express that he sees himself in his apostolic ministry </p>
<p>as the one who lls up that amount of the suering set for the </p>
