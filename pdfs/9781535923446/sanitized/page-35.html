<p>tion as a form of preparation for such visions. Eventually this led to what </p>
<p>the later rabbis called the “two powers in heaven” heresy, since the name </p>
<p>Yahweh was said to include two deities. ere is no doubt that our sources </p>
<p>on merkabah mysticism postdate Paul, nonetheless, similar visionary ex-</p>
<p>periences, ascents to heaven, and interest in heavenly worship are attested </p>
<p>pre-70 CE (e.g., Pss 29:1–2; 148:1–2; 2 Cor 12:1–4; 1 En. 14:8–23; 4Q405; </p>
<p>Apoc. Ab. 17:1–21; Apoc. Zeph. 8:3–4; Ascen. Isa. 7:13—9:33), which pro-</p>
<p>vide a backdrop to Col 2:18.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>Second, adherence to regulations of the Mosaic law can be linked to </p>
<p>the veneration and appeasement of angels. e law was said to have been </p>
<p>given to Moses by God through angels (see Gal 3:19; Acts 7:53; Heb 2:2). </p>
<p>As such, keeping the law becomes a tribute to the angels and disobedi-</p>
<p>ence to the precepts of the law can result in judgment from angelic be-</p>
<p>ings. ere is clear evidence that some Jews taught that circumcision and </p>
<p>obedience to the law could protect someone from evil angels.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>us, the</p>
<p>need to follow the regulations of the Torah in Col 2:14, 16–17 is perhaps </p>
<p>connected to the heavenly jurisdiction of the “thrones” and “authorities” </p>
<p>who are angelic beings that demand observance of the law. Paul argues </p>
<p>in turn that there is no need to placate those cosmic entities whom the </p>
<p>Messiah has supremacy over (1:16; 2:8–10) and has subjugated (2:15).</p>
<p>ird, the references to asceticism, visions, and the worship of an-</p>
<p>gels underscore the mystical aspect of the philosophy even more. is is </p>
<p>apparent in 2:18 where there are those who “insist” or “delight”</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>upon</p>
<p>ascetic practices and self-abasement. is self-mortication probably </p>
<p>pertains to fasting as an expression of humility (Pss 35:13; 69:10; Isa 58:3, </p>
<p>5; Jdt 4:9). e self-deprivation of fasting was oen a means to visionary </p>
<p>experiences (Dan 10:2–3; Apoc. Ab. 9:7–10; 12:1–2; T. Isaac 4:1–6; 5:4; 4 </p>
<p>Ezra 5:13, 20; 6:35; 9:23–25; 2 Bar. 43:3; Gk. Apoc. Ezra 1:2–7) and this </p>
<p>may have enabled participants to have, or claim to have had, visions of </p>
<p>74. Cf. discussion in Smith 2006: 38–73.</p>
<p>75. CD 16.4–6 and the “Angel of Obstruction”; Jub. 15:28–32 and the spirits who “rule </p>
<p>so that they might be led astray.” According to Hippolytus (Haer. 9.11) a Jewish Christian </p>
<p>group called the Elchasai urged keeping the Sabbath because “ere exist wicked stars of </p>
<p>impiety . . . Honour the day of thee Sabbath, since that day is one of those during which </p>
<p>prevails (the power) of these stars.” Note also the incantation of 4Q510 1:4–6 for ward-</p>
<p>ing o evil angels and spirits: “And I, the Sage, declare the grandeur of his radiance in </p>
<p>order to frighten and terr[ify] all the spirits of the ravaging angels and the bastard spirits, </p>
<p>demons, Liliths, owls, and [jackals . . .].”</p>

<p>148.2).</p>
