<p>Colossians 1:1–2</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>ognize that this was not necessarily evident to all readers).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>While the</p>
<p>Greek word Christos may be (or is on the way to becoming) a proper </p>
<p>name, it has not lost all of its titular signicance.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>“Christ” is perhaps a</p>
<p>cognomen like “Caesar” of “Gaius Julius Caesar.” But just like “Caesar,” </p>
<p>“Christ” can also have a titular and regal meaning. We should not forget </p>
<p>that Christos is oen a Greek translation for the Hebrew masiah and the </p>
<p>Aramaic mesiha from which we get “Messiah.” A reverse order of “Jesus </p>
<p>Messiah” or “Jesus Christ” is more common in Paul (e.g., 1:3) and under-</p>
<p>scores its titular nature especially when coordinate to “Lord,” i.e., “Lord </p>
<p>Jesus Christ.” Indeed, Christ Jesus/Jesus Christ arguably evokes a titular </p>
<p>sense of “Jesus the Messiah” and perhaps even an implied confession of </p>
<p>“Jesus is the Messiah” as well. Such a title or confession conjures up an </p>
<p>implied narrative about the life, death, and exaltation of Jesus. In other </p>
<p>words, Messiah Jesus or Jesus Messiah is essentially an encoded reference </p>
<p>to the status and story of Jesus of Nazareth as the king of Israel and exalted </p>
<p>Lord of the world.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Although Paul’s apostolate is anchored in Messiah Jesus, it is also </p>
<p>in accordance with the will of God, adding a theocentric dimension to </p>
<p>Paul’s apostolic oce. His service rendered to Jesus is ultimately opera-</p>
tive through divine empowerment, i.e., God working through Paul. God
<p>is working out his will, plan, and purpose through the Pauline mission. </p>
<p>Paul is looped in a circle of authority between Messiah Jesus and God, as </p>
<p>Dunn comments: “Paul as apostle of Christ Jesus, Jesus as Christ owned </p>
<p>and authorized by God, and God as the one God of Israel through whose </p>
<p>Messiah and apostle good news is extending to the nations.”</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Paul is not</p>
<p>alone in his missionary endeavors. He has a cohort of coworkers and nat-</p>
<p>urally makes mention of his cosender Timothy [our] brother (perhaps </p>
<p>the scribe and coauthor of the epistle). Timothy, a disciple from Lystra </p>
<p>(Acts 16:1–3), is a cosender in other correspondence (2 Cor 1:1; Phil 1:1; </p>
<p>1 ess 1:1; 2 ess 1:1; Phlm 1). Later in the epistle Paul will add men-</p>
<p>tion of Tychicus as another brother who was quite likely the letter carrier </p>
<p>accompanied by Onesimus (4:7–9).</p>
<p>1. A good justication for this strategy is provided by Blomberg 2003.</p>
<p>2. Cf. Wright 1986: 46–47; Barth and Blanke 1994: 137; ompson 2005: 18.</p>
<p>3. According to Barth and Blanke (1994: 146), “e meaning of ‘gospel’ is pregnantly </p>
<p>expressed in these rst two verses of Col.”</p>
