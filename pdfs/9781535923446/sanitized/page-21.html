<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>ing a lot of early traditional Christian material (Col 1:12–20; 3:5–14; </p>
<p>3:18–4:1; and perhaps 2:9–15)</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>and mirroring some of the language</p>
<p>of the philosophy that had become controversial in Colossae (e.g., </p>
<p>Col 1:19; 2:9, 18). From a rhetorical vantage point, the letters to </p>
<p>Ephesus and Colossae, cities in Roman Asia, may deliberately con-</p>
<p>tain an Asiatic rhetoric that was oen more owery, ornamented, </p>
<p>poetic, and slightly pompous compared to its Greek counterpart, </p>
<p>thus accounting for the more descriptive and expansive nature of the </p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>Rhetorical training itself urged the necessity of adapting</p>
<p>one’s style, language, and content to t the occasion depending on </p>
<p>the persona needed for the speaker or author.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>(4) Colossians does not properly t the genre of a pseudepigraphal let-</p>
<p>ter, which is ordinarily attributed to a famous gure of the past to </p>
<p>one of his contemporaries and is intended to be of interest to its real </p>
<p>readers only in a general sense. e problem in Colossae seems to be </p>
quite specic and there is no attempt to bridge the divide between
<p>ctive readers and real readers by means of a “testament” or other </p>
<p>literary device.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is nothing about the language,</p>
<p>style, and form that is wildly anachronistic or cannot be plausibly </p>
<p>placed within the context of Paul’s own lifetime, and much of the </p>
<p>structure and language sounds evidently genuine.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the theology of Colossians, Lohse claims that </p>
<p>the thought of Colossians exhibits Pauline features but is an example </p>
<p>of a Pauline theology that has undergone a profound change in many </p>
<p>respects.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>To begin with, on ecclesiology, in the undisputed letters the</p>
<p>“church” is always the church local (e.g., Gal 1:2; 1 ess 1:1; 1 Cor 1:2; 2 </p>
<p>24. Cf. Cannon (1983: 49): “Based on the United Bible Societies’ text of Colossians, </p>
<p>of the 114 lines of text in the rst two chapters, thirty-four (or thirty percent) of them </p>
<p>are drawn from traditional material and twenty-ve of them are careful applications of </p>
<p>the traditional material. is means that over y percent of the rst two chapters of </p>
<p>Colossians are inuenced by words, ideas, and modes of expression that were already </p>
<p>existing in the early church. Any judgment made about the authorship of the letter must </p>
<p>keep this important factor fully in mind.”</p>

<p>on the apparently developed Christology of Colossians.</p>
