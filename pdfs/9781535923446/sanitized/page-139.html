<p>Closing Words of Exhortation from a Missionary Friend</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>bringing believers to maturity and full assurance. Such traits describe </p>
<p>persons who are well developed, condent in themselves and in God, and </p>
<p>not easily given over to unwholesome inuence (see Eph 4:14: “We must </p>
<p>no longer be children, tossed to and fro and blown about by every wind </p>
<p>of doctrine, by people’s trickery, by their crainess in deceitful scheming” </p>
<p>[nrsv]). Epaphras’s prayer is that they have the maturity, wisdom, and </p>
<p>condence to resist the incursions of the teachers with their philosophy. </p>
<p>Paul testies that Epaphras has worked hard for them and for the other </p>
<p>churches of the Lycus Valley (Laodicea and Hierapolis), therefore, they </p>
<p>should take pride in his eorts as their representative and honor him by </p>
<p>holding to the pattern of teaching that he passed on to them. Greetings </p>
<p>are also extended from Luke the beloved physician</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>and Demas who were</p>
<p>prominent members in the Pauline circle (Phlm 24; 2 Tim 4:10–11).</p>
<p>Paul requests that greetings also be extended to the brothers and </p>
<p>sisters in Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house, which </p>
<p>is probably the other major household church in the Lycus Valley. If </p>
<p>someone was travelling to Colossae from Ephesus they would naturally </p>
<p>go through Laodicea on the way. A letter had already been delivered to </p>
<p>those in Laodicea and both households are to exchange letters and to read </p>
<p>them for the exhortation of the believers. e congregational reading of </p>
<p>the letter highlights the oral and aural nature of early Christian texts. </p>
<p>Reading was not so much a matter of private study, but a communal act </p>
<p>undertaken in the context of worship or shared meals. But what was this </p>
<p>letter to the Laodiceans? It might be Ephesians, which we have grounds to </p>
<p>suspect was a circular letter for the Pauline churches of Asia given that “in </p>
<p>Ephesus” in Eph 1:1 does not occur in some manuscripts (P</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> )* B* 424</p>
<p>c</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1739).</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>What is more, both letters refer to the arrival of Tychicus, which is</p>
<p>probably no small coincidence (Eph 6:21; Col 4:7). Marcion purportedly </p>
<p>designated the epistle as “to the Laodiceans,” which, though tertiary evi-</p>
<p>dence at best is still illuminating. e fact is that we simply do not know </p>
<p>for sure what the letter was, but Ephesians is probably the best guess that </p>
<p>we can make.</p>

<p>6. is is the only place where Luke’s vocation is made known to us, and, given that </p>
<p>he is not mentioned as among those of the “circumcision,” probably means that he was </p>
<p>a Gentile.</p>
<p>7. Cf. Lightfoot 1879: 272–98.</p>
<p>8. e proposal of John Knox (1959) that the letter to the Laodiceans is in fact </p>
<p>Philemon has, despite its intriguing qualities, not met with wide approval. ere are ve </p>
