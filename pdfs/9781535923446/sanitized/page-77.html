<p>pauL’s service: </p>
<p>Messianic Woes, Messianic Mission, </p>
<p>and the Messianic Mystery (1:24—2:7)</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Now I rejoice in my suerings on your behalf, and in my</p>
<p>esh I am lling up what is lacking in the aictions of the </p>
<p>Messiah, on behalf of his body, that is, the church, </p>
<p>25</p>
<p>which I</p>
<p>became a servant according to the commission of God given to </p>
<p>me for you, to fulll the word of God—</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>the mystery that has </p>
<p>been hidden from the ages and from generations, but now has </p>
<p>been manifested to his saints. </p>
<p>27</p>
<p>To them God chose to make</p>
<p>known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of this glo-</p>
<p>rious mystery, which is Messiah in you, the hope of glory.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> We proclaim him, admonishing all people and teach-</p>
<p>ing all people in all wisdom, in order that we may present all </p>
<p>people mature in Messiah. </p>
<p>29</p>
<p> For this I labor, struggling ac-</p>
<p>cording to his power which operates in me so mightily. </p>
<p>1</p>
<p>For</p>
<p>I wish you to know how great a struggle I have on behalf of </p>
<p>you and for those in Laodicea and for all those who have not </p>
<p>seen me in the esh, </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>so that their hearts might be comforted</p>
<p>and joined together in love, and have all the riches of full as-</p>
<p>surance of understanding and the knowledge of the mystery </p>
<p>of God, which is the Messiah. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>In whom are hidden all the</p>
<p>treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>I say this in order that no one might deceive you with</p>
<p>persuasive arguments. </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>For even if I am absent in the esh,</p>
<p>yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your orderli-</p>
<p>ness and the rmness of your faithfulness in the Messiah. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>erefore, as you received Messiah Jesus the Lord, so walk</p>
<p>in him, </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>being rooted and built up in him and conrmed in</p>
<p>the faith just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.</p>
