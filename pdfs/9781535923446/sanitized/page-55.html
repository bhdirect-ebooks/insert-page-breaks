<p>anksgiving and Intercession</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>connects them to this trans-provincial movement. rough Epaphras, the </p>
<p>Colossians have learned the gospel, the life of faith in the Messiah, and no </p>
<p>doubt news about other churches in Palestine, Syria, Asia Minor, Greece, </p>
<p>and Italy too. Epaphras’s status, and therefore his continuing inuence in </p>
<p>Colossae, is lauded by Paul when he calls Epaphras a beloved fellow-slave </p>
<p>and faithful servant. Paul uses similar terms for other coworkers else-</p>
<p>where (e.g., Tychicus in 4:7) and the place of Epaphras as a member in the </p>
<p>Pauline circle is emphasized in the phrase on our behalf,</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>suggesting that</p>
<p>Epaphras was Paul’s representative in Colossae. He is the cipher through </p>
<p>which mutual and reciprocal relations are established between Paul, </p>
<p>his coworkers, and the Pauline churches on one side and the Colossian </p>
<p>believers on the other. Epaphras then has a unique role as giving testi-</p>
<p>mony to Paul’s gospel in Colossae and also giving testimony about the </p>
<p>Colossians’ mutual aection for other assemblies of Jesus Christ. us, </p>
<p>from a social perspective, Paul is very much interested in amicable and </p>
<p>sustained relationships between himself and the Colossians, and to vali-</p>
<p>date the ministry of Epaphras as well.</p>
<p>Paul’s Petition for the Colossians to Anticipate Their </p>
<p>Growth and Renewal in Messiah (1:9–14)</p>
<p>e second half of Paul’s prayer shis from thanksgiving to intercession. </p>
<p>Paul’s prayer, marked with urgency and emphasis (hence, not ceased </p>
<p>praying for you), turns to matters of knowledge, wisdom, understanding, </p>
lifestyle, divine empowerment, and spiritual fruits among the Colossians.
<p>e prayer is not only Paul’s, but is that of his companions too, as implied </p>
<p>by the plural pronoun we. Paul twice mentions knowledge (epignōsei) </p>
<p>which has led some to infer that Paul (or a post-Pauline author) is engag-</p>
<p>ing Gnosticism. However, “knowledge” was not the essence of Gnosticism </p>
<p>and all religions and philosophies have a form of intellectual content.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>object of Paul’s praying and petitioning is for the Colossians to grasp the </p>
<p>12. Along with a number of ancient witnesses I have adopted the reading of “our </p>
<p>behalf” as opposed to “your behalf” (P</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> )* B D* F G) since it is the more dicult read-</p>
<p>ing and has the earliest textual support. See also Moule 1957: 27 n.1; Pokorný 1991: 44 </p>
<p>n. 50; Wolter 1993: 56.</p>
<p>13. Cf. McL. Wilson (2005: 103): “e later development of the Gnostic Sophia myth </p>
<p>is not directly relevant to the study of Colossians, but it is sometimes important to be </p>
<p>aware of the nal outcome.”</p>
