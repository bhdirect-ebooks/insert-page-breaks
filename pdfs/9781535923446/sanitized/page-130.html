<p>Colossians 3:22—4:1</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>owned by non-Christians, but more probably Christian slaves (Christian </p>
<p>sometimes by virtue of group conversion, e.g., Acts 11:14; 16:15, 31, 34; </p>
<p>18:8) within Christian households.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Paul calls on slaves to obey in all</p>
<p>matters their earthly masters and he makes the point with a number of </p>
<p>qualications. First, they are to serve not only when they are watching, </p>
<p>as people-pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord. e ser-</p>
<p>vice rendered is not to be like that of a person constantly checking to see </p>
<p>if their master is around so eort and work can be feigned at appropriate </p>
<p>moments. Instead, it is to be genuine and sincere service. e accompa-</p>
<p>nying attitude of fearing the Lord (see the lxx: Exod 1:17, 21; Lev 19:32; </p>
<p>25:17; Ps 54:20; and nt: 1 Pet 2:17; Rev 11:18; 14:7; 19:5) means reverent </p>
<p>submission and obedience to his will. Fear of the Lord is also a mark of </p>
<p>loving service to God (Deut 10:12–13) and a sign of God-centered wisdom </p>
<p>(Ps 111:10; 112:1; Prov 1:7; 9:10; 15:33; Sir 1:14–27; 19:20; 21:11). Second, </p>
<p>they are to work heartily, as to the Lord and not for men. e phrase </p>
<p>work heartily is literally “from the soul” (ek psuchē), or from the inner </p>
<p>most fabric of one’s being. Slaves are not to work only when cornered like </p>
<p>a rat in a trap, but without need of supervision and in a genuine spirit of </p>
<p>obedience. What is done for earthly masters is really performed for the </p>
<p>benet of the Lord Messiah who is the ultimate object of their service. </p>
<p>Further justication for such behavior is supplied by Paul in highlighting </p>
<p>elements of reward and judgment. Slaves are to conduct themselves as </p>
<p>such since they know that from the Lord you will receive the reward of </p>
<p>inheritance. Slaves had no rights of inheritance unless their masters set </p>
<p>them free, but for those who were born in slavery, lived in slavery, and </p>
<p>would probably die in slavery, this promise of inheritance was good news. </p>
<p>eir lack of honor and inherited possessions would be supplied by the </p>
<p>Lord himself as their reward for service to him. But rewards are a two </p>
<p>way street. As good behavior is rewarded with an inheritance, so also the </p>
<p>wrongdoer receives back appropriate punishment for his aberrant ways. </p>
<p>at is a principle rooted in the impartiality of God.</p>
<p>en, as Paul does elsewhere, he again turns the focus from the </p>
<p>submissive partner to the master: Masters, treat your slaves justly and </p>
<p>fairly, knowing that you also have a master in heaven. e masters are </p>
<p>themselves slaves to the Lord in heaven and their service to him must be </p>
<p>equally appropriate as that of slaves entrusted to their care and service. </p>
