<p>Colossians 3:5–11</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>brings salvation not by shedding the blood of his subjects, but instead by </p>
<p>shedding his own blood as an atonement for their transgressions (1:14, </p>
<p>20, 22; 2:13; 3:13). In many ways, the whole context of 1:15—4:6 seems </p>
<p>set on establishing an alternative set of principles for moral order, self-</p>
<p>identity, and future security than that provided by the Roman imperial </p>
<p>edice.</p>
<p>Living as the New Israel in the New Age (3:12–17)</p>
<p>Paul steadily moves the train of thought further in v. 12 with therefore </p>
<p>and identies the Colossians as God’s elect, holy and beloved, which are </p>
<p>common enough designations for Christians elsewhere in his letters (see </p>
<p>Rom 8:33; Titus 1:1). e designation was also a common one for Israel </p>
<p>(e.g., Deut 7:6–7; 33:3) and Paul conceives of the church as the represen-</p>
<p>tatives of Israel in the messianic age (see Gal 6:16; Phil 3:3). rough faith </p>
<p>in Jesus the Colossians are assured of their membership in the people </p>
<p>of God, and no addition of distinctive Jewish laws or mystical piety can </p>
<p>supplement that. e imperatives of the new creation are rearmed, not </p>
<p>in the sense of vice lists or proscribed behaviors, but now in a list of vir-</p>
<p>tuous actions and attitudes to be cultivated in the community. ey are </p>
<p>commanded to clothe yourselves or put on qualities including hearts of </p>
<p>compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience as well as bear-</p>
<p>ing with one another and forgiving each other. ese virtues can be said </p>
<p>to represent the imitatio Christi (“imitation of Christ”) that is coupled </p>
<p>with a call to mutual understanding and mutual forgiveness. Mutuality </p>
<p>or reciprocal treatment is emphasized by the pronouns one another and </p>
<p>each other, which are anchored in the example of Jesus Christ, hence the </p>
<p>clause just as the Lord graciously forgave you. Paul calls on them not </p>
<p>only to remember this forgiveness, but to replicate it among themselves. </p>
<p>ere are undoubtedly some echoes of the Jesus tradition here, where </p>
<p>Jesus commanded his followers to forgive each other in an almost scan-</p>
<p>dalous way (e.g., Luke 11:4/Matt 6:12, 14–15; Luke 17:4/Matt 18:21–22; </p>
<p>Matt 18:23–35; Luke 23:34; John 20:23). For Jesus as for Paul, to be part </p>
<p>of the new Israel entails that the Colossians show their family likeness </p>
<p>by imparting what they have already received themselves: forgiveness.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e realization that each person in their midst is still in the process of </p>
<p>37. Lucas 1980: 151.</p>
