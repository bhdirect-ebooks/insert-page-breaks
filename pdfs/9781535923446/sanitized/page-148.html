<p>Philemon 1–7</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>e opening self-identication of Paul is uniquely spelled out as a </p>
<p>prisoner for Messiah Jesus, which is no doubt literal (see Phlm 9; Eph </p>
<p>3:1) and refers to an imprisonment most probably during his time in </p>
<p>Ephesus. Perhaps the designation attempts to evoke a deliberate pathos, </p>
<p>since the legal position of a slave was not dissimilar to that of a prisoner </p>
<p>and so adds further relevance to the exhortation that Paul will make for a </p>
<p>slave. Paul is not a prisoner of “Caesar” or the “state” but of the Messiah </p>
<p>Jesus, since it is the cause of the Messiah and the gospel for which he is in </p>
<p>chains. As elsewhere, Timothy is included as cosender (1 ess 1:1; Phil </p>
<p>1:1; Col 1:1–2; 2 ess 1:1), but his involvement in the composition of the </p>
<p>letter, unlike Colossians, is probably indirect. Paul writes this short and </p>
<p>very personal letter with his own hand (v. 19). e addressee is Philemon, </p>
<p>which was a fairly popular name in Phrygia, common in inscriptions and </p>
<p>papyri.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>He is described as a beloved fellow worker, which associates him</p>
<p>with the Pauline mission, though in what sense is undened (in later </p>
<p>church tradition he is identied as the bishop of Colossae).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Philemon</p>
<p>may have some role in the leadership of the church that meets in his </p>
<p>house, along with Archippus, or else he has contributed to Paul’s mission-</p>
<p>ary endeavors at some point in the past. e latter is more likely in view </p>
<p>of the reference to “partnership” in v. 17, which suggests a sharing of re-</p>
<p>sources. Also named is Apphia, who is probably Philemon’s wife or sister. </p>
<p>is again is a common Phrygian name, and in one instance it is found </p>
<p>on a tombstone in the ruins of Colossae: “Hermas to his wife Apphia, the </p>
<p>daughter of Trypho.”</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Regardless of her actual relation to Philemon, as</p>
<p>the lady of the house she would have been the primary overseer of slaves </p>
<p>in the dwelling and in the daily operation of the household. She may also </p>
<p>have held some formal oce in the house church that met in her house. </p>
<p>Archippus is named next. He probably was the primary ll-in pastor in </p>
<p>Colossae given Epaphras’s absence. Archippus was called to discharge </p>
<p>some kind of “ministry” in the interim while Epaphras was away (Col </p>
<p>4:17). Importantly, the letter is also addressed, even if obliquely, to the </p>
<p>church in your house. e your is ambiguous as it could refer to a house </p>
<p>belonging to either Philemon, Apphia, or Archippus, but the former </p>
<p>seems more probable given that Philemon is the rst named addressee </p>
