<p>e Supremacy of Messiah in Creation and Reconciliation</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>the Arian controversy of the fourth century).</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Does rstborn imply that</p>
<p>Jesus is merely the most supreme created being? Hardly! e main point is </p>
<p>surely Jesus’s function in bringing creation into being and his sovereignty </p>
<p>over the entire created order. at authority encompasses the material </p>
<p>and immaterial realms, the earthly and heavenly spheres, human and an-</p>
<p>gelic creatures.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Moreover, if Paul had wanted to suggest that Jesus was</p>
<p>the rst of God’s creatures to be formed he would have used the adjective </p>
<p>prōtoktistos (“created rst”) or the noun prōtoplastos (“rst made”). e </p>
<p>words for “rstborn” and “rst-fruits” are ascribed to Jesus in the New </p>
<p>Testament where they carry connotations of priority since Jesus is the </p>
<p>rstborn of a new humanity which is to be gloried as its exalted Lord is </p>
<p>gloried (Rom 8:29; 1 Cor 15:20, 23; Rev 1:5 and Col 1:18).</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>In Hebrews,</p>
<p>“rstborn” implies a special status and higher rank over and above others </p>
<p>(e.g. Heb 1:6). As the rstborn Jesus is: (1) God’s appointed ruler over all </p>
<p>of creation with priority in time and primacy in rank; (2) Israel’s Messiah; </p>
<p>and (3) a Son of God like Adam and Israel.</p>
<p>A rationale for these statements is given in a causal clause because </p>
<p>in him were created all things, wherein all things encompasses every </p>
<p>imaginable sphere including heavens and earth, things visible and in-</p>
visible. e element of divine agency is repeated again when it is stated
<p>that all things were created through him as well. is underscores the </p>
<p>notion of God the Father creating the world through his preexistent Son. </p>
<p>In many ways, the Son appropriates the role normally attributed to the </p>
<p>Spirit in the creation of the cosmos. What is unparalleled, christologically </p>
<p>speaking, is that Paul says that the universe came into being for him.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>It</p>
<p>is hard to emphasize what a striking remark this is as it makes creation </p>
<p>subordinate to Jesus the Messiah. is could mean that the universe came </p>
<p>into existence for his benet, but more likely it means that the universe </p>
<p>exists in order to be his designated domain of authority. It is an authority </p>
<p>20. Cf. Lightfoot 1879: 148–50; Gorday 2000: 12–14.</p>
<p>21. Cf. H. Balz (EDNT 3:190–91) who sees “rstborn” as not just a “matter of purely </p>
<p>temporal priority of the pre-existence Christ, but rather of a superiority of essence.”</p>
<p>22. BDAG 894.</p>
<p>23. Cf. Martin (1973: 58): “No Jewish thinker ever rose to these heights in daring to </p>
<p>predict that wisdom was the ultimate goal of creation”; and Lightfoot (1879: 155): “is </p>
<p>expression has no parallel, and could have none, in the Alexandrian phraseology and </p>
<p>doctrine.” I think the closest analogy to this text is 4 Ezra 6:53–59, which says that the </p>
<p>world was created for “Israel,” and the Shepherd of Hermas 8:1, which says that the world </p>
<p>was created for the “church.”</p>
