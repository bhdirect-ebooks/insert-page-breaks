<p>anksgiving and Intercession</p>

<p>dendi or a body of teachings about Christ.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>is faithfulness is expressed</p>
<p>in Messiah, that is, within the sphere of Jesus’s lordship, as opposed to </p>
<p>rendering him simply the object of faith itself.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>e Colossians are also</p>
<p>known for their love for the saints which expresses a sense of aection </p>
<p>and belonging to other Jesus-believers whom they have not yet met. e </p>
<p>relationship of hope to the preceding virtues is dicult to gauge. e </p>
<p>causal clause (dia) might suggest that hope is the basis of their faithful-</p>
<p>ness and love. Alternatively, the clause may relate back to the dominat-</p>
<p>ing verb above, we always give thanks (eucharistoumen), and provide a </p>
<p>further reason for praise and gratitude to God.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>e hope is described as</p>
<p>laid up for you in the heavenlies and the word for laid up (apokeimai) </p>
<p>can denote either something put away for safekeeping (e.g., Luke 19:20) </p>
<p>or reserved as a reward (e.g., 2 Tim 4:8). Both senses are allowable al-</p>
<p>though the emphasis should probably fall on the former as it is the sense </p>
<p>of security and certainty (i.e., assurance) that is paramount. Later on Paul </p>
<p>will refer to the return of the Messiah as the hope of glory, as the time </p>
<p>when Jesus will nally be manifested (1:27; 3:4).</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Even with the emphasis</p>
<p>on present or realized eschatology (e.g., 2:11–13), there is no evacuation </p>
<p>of an apocalyptic hope or a collapse into an entirely present eschatological </p>
<p>experience. e point being pressed is that the Colossians’ own hope is </p>
<p>bound up with the Messiah as God’s co-regent. He is now enthroned in </p>
<p>the heavenlies and the hope centered on him is certain and unfailing. e </p>
<p>purported governance of the angelic powers over daily life as stipulated </p>
<p>by the philosophy may call precisely for the present reign of the Messiah </p>
<p>to be emphasized.</p>
<p>e hope that centers on the exaltation of the Messiah was made </p>
<p>known to the Colossians through the word of truth: the gospel. Here </p>
<p>gospel stands in apposition to word of truth. is description is natu-</p>
<p>rally contrasted with Paul’s assessment of the teachings of the philoso-</p>
<p>6. It is my contention that pistis has the meaning of “faith” as doctrinal content in </p>
<p>Col 1:23; 2:7, but it denotes “faithfulness” in Col 1:4; 2:5. I would add that any absolute </p>
<p>bifurcation between “faith” and “faithfulness” is pointless, since Christian faithfulness </p>
<p>will always require continued adherence and delity to a delivered body of teaching. See </p>
