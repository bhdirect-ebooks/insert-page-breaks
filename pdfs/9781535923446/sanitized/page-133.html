<p>Closing Words of Exhortation from a Missionary Friend</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>ter has been read among you, have it read also in the church </p>
<p>of the Laodiceans; and see that you also read the letter from </p>
<p>Laodicea. </p>
<p>17</p>
<p>And say to Archippus, “See to it that you fulll</p>
<p>the ministry which you have received in the Lord.” </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>I, Paul,</p>
<p>write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my chains. </p>
<p>e grace be with you.</p>
<p>e epistle rounds o with some nal exhortations, a commendation of </p>
<p>the ministry of Paul and his coworkers, nal greetings, and the grace. is </p>
<p>section also recaps many of the earlier themes of the letter including that </p>
<p>of thanksgiving (1:3, 11; 3:15, 17 and 4:2), gospel proclamation (1:15–29 </p>
<p>and 4:3), the mystery of the Messiah (1:26–27; 2:2 and 4:3), and the qual-</p>
<p>ity of Epaphras’s ministry (1:7 and 4:12–13). Here Paul and his coauthors </p>
<p>seek, above all, to cement the relationship between the Colossian believ-</p>
<p>ers and the Pauline churches. is is emphasized in a number of ways. To </p>
<p>begin with, Paul emphasizes (three times no less) that he wants them to </p>
<p>be informed of his own situation, which is why Tychicus and Onesimus </p>
<p>have been dispatched for the task of transmitting rsthand accounts of </p>
<p>Paul’s situation to them (4:7–9). On top of that, there is also mentioned </p>
<p>twice a reference to Onesimus and Epaphras as those who are one of your </p>
<p>own (lit. “from you” in 4:9, 12). In other words, the Colossians already </p>
<p>are involved in the Pauline mission via Epaphras and Onesimus, and that </p>
<p>solidarity is reinforced by making them fully aware of the state of aairs </p>
<p>as they pertain to Paul and his companions. Paul deliberately presumes </p>
<p>on their support and interest, which, if they renege on it by subscribing to </p>
<p>the philosophy, potentially brings shame upon them. is rearmation </p>
<p>of a special bond between the Pauline churches and the Colossians means </p>
<p>that they have an obligation to respond accordingly as those treated as </p>
<p>supporters and benefactors of the Pauline mission. is assumes a set of </p>
<p>obligations on their part in terms of continued adherence to shared be-</p>
<p>liefs and upholding standards of conduct if reciprocal relations are to be </p>
<p>maintained. In other words, because they belong to the Pauline churches </p>
<p>they are indebted to continue believing the Pauline gospel. Paul calls on </p>
<p>them to live up to the praises that he has heaped upon them in 1:2–8. </p>
<p>Paul demonstrates that their role as partners with the Pauline mission </p>
<p>and their sense of shared identity with other Christian believers is inti-</p>
