<p>Excursus: Colossians and the Roman Empire</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>It is possible to identify a number of elements in Paul’s letter to the </p>
<p>Colossians that carry theopolitical implications and perhaps make a tacit </p>
<p>jibe against Roman imperial claims if we read the literary subtext and social </p>
<p>context carefully.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>(1) We have already seen that the language of Jesus as</p>
<p>possessing “preeminence” in 1:18 might call to mind the image of the Roman </p>
<p>emperor as auctoritas, that is, the one possessing an unsurpassable degree </p>
<p>of power and prestige. It could well be that “Lord Jesus Christ” (1:3; cf. </p>
<p>2:6) corresponds to the Roman emperors’ throne name, “Imperator Caesar </p>
<p>Augustus” or “Imperator Nero Augustus.”</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>(2) The celebrated and deiﬁed</p>
<p>pax Romana (peace of Rome) that was created by imperial violence is eclipsed </p>
<p>by the “peace of Messiah” (3:15), which results in reconciliation brought </p>
<p>about by Jesus’s sacriﬁcial death (1:15–23). (3) Jesus’s death is treated as </p>
<p>a Roman triumph over rebellious subjects (2:15) and the metaphor clearly </p>
<p>mimics and mocks Roman victory celebrations. Disarming, crucifying, and </p>
<p>basking in bloody glory is what the Romans did, except that here the roles </p>
<p>seem to be reversed and the victim has become the victor. (4) The incorpora-</p>
<p>tion of trans-ethnic identities like Jew, Gentile, Barbarian, and Scythian into </p>
<p>“Messiah” mirrors the attempt of Rome to incorporate peoples and kingdoms </p>
<p>into its empire by granting citizenship and benefaction to conquered territo-</p>
<p>ries. (5) The “gospel” (1:5, 23) mirrors imperial statements that celebrate </p>
<p>the good news of the emperor’s birth and accession. The gospel of Rome grew </p>
<p>and spread with its successful campaigns and the gospel of Paul grew with its </p>
<p>Spirit driven proclamation and reception. The question is: “Whose gospel is </p>
<p>the source of a fruitfulness that will last and sustain the world—the gospel of </p>
<p>Caesar or the gospel of Jesus?”</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>(6) The hostile powers that Jesus subjugates</p>
<p>may include deceased Roman emperors who were thought to become gods </p>
<p>after death (i.e., apotheosis) or even living emperors. Nero’s example might </p>
<p>be particularly relevant assuming a date for Colossians in the late 50s or early </p>
<p>60s. Nero was acclaimed as “Jupiter himself on earth in altered guise, or one </p>
<p>other of the powers above concealed under an assumed mortal semblance” </p>
<p>(1:16; 2:8, 15, 20).</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>I doubt that Colossians was written or heard as a</p>
<p>counter-imperial manifesto, but the content and context of the imagery does </p>
<p>naturally lend itself to contrasting two metanarratives about the salvation of </p>
