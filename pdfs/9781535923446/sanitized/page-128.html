<p>Colossians 3:18—4:1</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>Yet it must be recognized that Christian authors appropriated these </p>
<p>well-known household codes probably for apologetic reasons and as a </p>
<p>means of ensuring the commendable conduct of Christian homes before </p>
<p>outsiders (see Col 4:5; 1 ess 4:12).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> e Christian household codes con-</p>
<p>cern how the lordship of Jesus Christ over a community is to be lived out </p>
<p>before the pagan world around them. While these codes are undoubtedly </p>
<p>patriarchal, they express that patriarchy in light of mutual obligations of </p>
<p>honor and love and clearly censure abuses of authority. ey were a nec-</p>
<p>essary way of stabilizing a para- or post-Jewish group that was regarded </p>
<p>as religiously sectarian, politically subversive, and socially oensive to </p>
<p>cultural elites and civic powers. e Colossian household code is not a </p>
<p>rearmation of the status quo of pagan ethics, nor a mandate for social </p>
<p>revolution, rather, it concerns the authority of the Lord over the house-</p>
<p>hold of faith and the mutual obligations that follow from the subordina-</p>
<p>tion of all authority under the Lord. In a nutshell, it is the application </p>
<p>of the principle of 3:17 to all: “And whatever you do, in word or deed, </p>
<p>do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus.”</p>

<p>Now how would Nympha</p>
<p>of Laodicea have responded to this unit of text? Following MacDonald, </p>
<p>I would say that her own position as household leader was aorded a </p>
<p>degree of protection and respectability by this admonition. She would </p>
<p>also, I suspect, have viewed such ethical teaching as obvious and prudent </p>
<p>for the world of emerging Christianity.</p>

<p>Household Relations among Husbands, Wives, and </p>
<p>Children (3:18–21)</p>
<p>Paul begins his exhortation about household relations with Wives, sub-</p>
<p>mit to your husbands as is tting in the Lord. Wives are to willingly </p>
<p>subject themselves to the authority of their husbands as such behavior is </p>
<p>appropriate for a women living in the sphere of the Lord’s authority. But </p>
<p>what actually makes such behavior tting (anēkō) is a good question. Is </p>
<p>it because it corresponds to the ordering of creation, with male rst and </p>
<p>woman born second (1 Tim 2:11–15); because of an analogy to Christ/</p>
<p>male headship over the church/wives (1 Cor 11:3, 7–9; Eph 5:23–24); or </p>
