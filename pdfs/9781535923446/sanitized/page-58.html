<p>Colossians 1:9–14</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>the imperishable inheritance of God (see common language with Exod </p>
<p>6:6; 14:30; Deut 13:5; Judg 6:9 [lxx]).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>ere might be a more specic</p>
<p>allusion to Isaiah’s appropriation of the exodus theme given the picture </p>
<p>of Israel being restored from “darkness” to “light” in Isa 9:1–2, 42:6–7, </p>
<p>16, 58:10, 60:1–3.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> ird, while there is a paucity of references to king-</p>
<p>dom in Paul, it is no less signicant.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>For Paul, the kingdom of God is</p>
<p>something that is principally future (reward, judgment, consummation), </p>
<p>but is already aecting the present.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> Indeed, the entire experience of sal-</p>
<p>vation can be dened as “kingdom” in some respects. Paul here places </p>
<p>kingdom in proximity to the Son, underscoring the unique relation that </p>
<p>Jesus has to the Father and his singular role in inaugurating and executing </p>
<p>the Father’s kingdom (also with obvious echoes of a messianic reading </p>
<p>of 2 Sam 7:13–17 and Ps 2:7).</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>e Son is also the sphere of the Father’s</p>
<p>saving activity and it is in him that believers apprehend redemption, the </p>
<p>forgiveness of sins. e concept of redemption for Greco-Roman per-</p>
<p>sons was known through the manumission of slaves. Redemption meant </p>
<p>release by the payment of a price. Elsewhere in his letters Paul states how </p>
<p>that price was paid (e.g., Rom 3:24; Eph 1:7; 1 Cor 6:20; 1 Tim 2:6; Titus </p>
<p>2:14).</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Specically, redemption is here correlated with the forgiveness of</p>
<p>sins. Many of Paul’s metaphors for salvation overlap. For instance, forgive-</p>
<p>ness is linked to justication (Acts 13:38–39; Rom 4:7–8) and redemption </p>
<p>(Col 1:14; Eph 1:7). Elsewhere in the New Testament forgiveness is related </p>
<p>to sacrice (Heb 9:22; 10:18) and cleansing (1 John 1:9). Concepts of re-</p>
<p>demption and forgiveness go naturally together since both are concerned </p>

<p>2:12; 2 ess 1:5; 2 Tim 4:1; 4:18; and Acts 14:22; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31. (See Wenham </p>
<p>1995: 71–80.)</p>
<p>19. Cf. Wright (1986: 62): “On the basis of 1 Corinthians 15:23–28 we may infer . . . </p>
<p>that Paul conceived of the establishment of this kingdom as a two-stage process. First </p>
<p>there is ‘the kingdom of Christ,’ which begins with Christ’s resurrection and exaltation </p>
<p>and continues until all enemies are subdued. en there comes the nal kingdom of God, </p>
<p>the restoration of all things.”</p>
<p>20. Cf. Wolter 1993: 67.</p>
<p>21. Of course Paul can also mention “redemption” without mentioning the mecha-</p>
<p>nism by which it occurs (Rom 8:23; 1 Cor 1:30; Gal 3:13; Eph 1:14). On redemption </p>
<p>imagery in Paul, see Williams 1999: 122–24; Bird 2008a: 106–8.</p>
