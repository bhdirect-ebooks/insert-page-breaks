<p>Israel’s election by including Gentiles in its purview. By transforming the </p>
<p>inherent value of “Jewishness” and its chief covenant boundary marker </p>
<p>of circumcision, Paul was implying that the ethnic and ritual distinctions </p>
<p>marking o Jew from Gentile had been removed. Consequently the ratio-</p>
<p>nale for separateness from and any sense of superiority over the Gentiles </p>
<p>has been nullied by the coming of the Messiah.</p>

e pairing of slave and free denotes the union of persons of diverse
<p>social status in the Christian gatherings. While “brotherhood” remained </p>
<p>a well-known Hellenistic ideal, the system of patron and client relation-</p>
<p>ships and the values of honor and reciprocation could never really accom-</p>
<p>modate the union of slave and free. Too much fraternizing with slaves was </p>
<p>discouraged since familiarity bred contempt and was bad for discipline. </p>
<p>Yet a poignant image of the bond between slave and free is encapsulated in </p>
<p>the Christian martyrdom narrative of the Roman matron Perpetua, who </p>
<p>stood hand in hand with her slave Felicitas in the arena of Carthage in </p>
<p>202 CE as both women faced a common death for their common faith.</p>

<p>Barbarians were the uncultured and primitive tribes looked down upon </p>
<p>by the Greeks. eir name is a form of onomatopoeia as their speech </p>
<p>sounded to Greeks like they were making incomprehensible mutterings </p>
<p>of “bar-bar-bar.” Scythians were a race from the area north of the Black </p>
<p>Sea and were known for their brutality. Josephus says of them: “Now, as </p>
<p>to the Scythians, they take a pleasure in killing men, and dier but little </p>
<p>from brute beasts.”</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>Yet Paul can include all these groups as part of the</p>
<p>new creation (3:10–11) and under the designation “brothers” (1:2). Justin </p>
<p>Martyr put it well: “But though a man be a Scythian or a Persian, if he </p>
<p>has the knowledge of God and of his Christ, and keeps the everlasting </p>
<p>righteous decrees, he is circumcised with the good and benecial circum-</p>
<p>cision, and is a friend of God, and God rejoices in his gis and oerings” </p>
<p>(Dial. Tryph. 28).</p>
<p>e new creation does not completely negate ethnicity, economics, </p>
<p>and gender (Christians continue to be male and female) but those dier-</p>
<p>ences are transcended by the glory of the new creation that ebbs into the </p>
<p>lives of believers. us, the Judaic character of the teachers’ instruction </p>
