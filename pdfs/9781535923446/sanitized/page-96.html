<p>Colossians 2:8–15</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>In the cross,</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>a vulgar means of execution that expressed the zenith of</p>
<p>death, disempowerment, and degradation, Jesus has triumphed over cos-</p>
<p>mic evil and struck a fatal blow to despots of malevolence. eir defeat </p>
<p>comes not from an armada of angels led by an archangel or by a Messiah </p>
<p>who rides a ery chariot at the head of a coalition of the willing, but in the </p>
<p>apex of human suering and shame. In Jewish thinking the nal defeat of </p>
<p>evil and the triumph of Yahweh over the forces of evil was scheduled for a </p>
<p>future day; something that Paul arms elsewhere (e.g. Rom 16:20; 1 Cor </p>
<p>15:24–27). However, here the epic battle and the victory of God are not </p>
<p>projected to the future, but are located in the past event of the crucixion. </p>
<p>e execution of Jesus has become a triumphal procession;</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>it is where</p>
<p>the powers have been put to public shame and made a spectacle for all to </p>
<p>see. is is called the Christus Victor motif, which regards Jesus’s death as </p>
<p>the victory of God over evil in all of its hideous forms, whether demonic, </p>
<p>political, human, or cosmic.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> Tom Wright is eminently quotable:</p>
<p>e “rulers and authorities” of Rome and of Israel—as Caird points </p>
<p>out, the best government and the highest religion of the world that </p>
<p>time had ever known—conspired to place Jesus on the cross. ese </p>
<p>powers, angry at his challenge to their sovereignty, stripped him </p>
<p>naked, held him up to public contempt, and celebrated a triumph </p>
<p>over him. In one of his most dramatic statements of the paradox of </p>
<p>the cross, and one moreover which shows in what physical detail </p>
<p>Paul could envisage the horrible death Jesus had died, he declares </p>
<p>that, on the contrary, on the cross God was stripping them naked, </p>
<p>was holding them to public contempt, and leading them in his own </p>
<p>triumphal procession—in Christ, the crucied Messiah. When </p>
<p>the “powers” had done their worst, crucifying the lord of glory </p>
<p>incognito on the charge of blasphemy and rebellion, they have </p>
<p>overreached themselves. He, neither blasphemer nor rebel, was in </p>
<p>fact their rightful sovereign. ey thereby exposed themselves for </p>
<p>what they were—usurpers of the authority which was properly his. </p>
<p>e cross therefore becomes the source of hope for all who had </p>
<p>been held captive under their rule, enslaved in fear and mutual </p>
<p> </p>
<p>25. It is possible that the personal pronoun autō in v. 15 could mean “in him” (rsv, </p>
<p>esv, nasb) or “in it” (kjv, nrsv) with “it” meaning “by the cross” (niv, nib, net). It seems </p>
<p>likely to me that the dative pronoun in v. 15 relates back to the dative “by the cross” (tō </p>
<p>staur tō) in v. 14.</p>
