<p>Engaging the Empty Deceit of Mystic Judaism</p>

<p>suspicion. Christ breaks the last hold that the “powers” had over </p>
<p>his people, by dying on their behalf. He now welcomes them into </p>
<p>a new family in which the ways of the old world—its behaviour, </p>
<p>its distinctions of race and class and sex, its blind obedience to the </p>
<p>“forces” of politics and economics, prejudice and superstition—</p>
<p>have become quite simply out of date, a ragged and defeated </p>
<p>rabble.</p>

<p>e sequence of metaphors is stunning and powerful. In the circumci-</p>
<p>sion of the Messiah the old uncircumcised esh is stripped away and a </p>
<p>new person is brought to life. e power of the Messiah’s passion ows </p>
<p>over into believers as they share in his death and resurrection through </p>
<p>baptism. e decrees and condemnation of the Torah are singularly swept </p>
<p>aside through his atoning death. Finally, the cosmic powers that use Torah </p>
<p>to oppress are disarmed and paraded as captive fugitives and reduced to </p>
<p>little more than tokens of the Messiah’s triumphant reign. us, there is </p>
<p>more at stake and more blessings available from being “in him” than what </p>
<p>adherence to the philosophy oers.</p>
<p>The Power of Union with the Messiah and the Impotence </p>
<p>of the Torah (2:16–23)</p>
<p>If the works of the Messiah are eminently superior to the works of the phi-</p>
<p>losophy, then that carries with it a number of corollaries that Paul spells </p>
<p>out, hence therefore. Paul unpacks what this means now to the claims </p>
<p>of the teachers and the way of life that they are urging the Colossians to </p>
<p>follow. To begin with, they must let no one judge them with the sense </p>
<p>of condemn or pass judgment over. Such language belongs to a context </p>
<p>of intra-Jewish debates where there could be severe evaluations about </p>
<p>whether certain disputed practices were in accordance with the law or </p>
<p>not, i.e., disputes about halakah or interpretive matters related to daily </p>
<p>living (see Luke 6:37/Matt 7:1; John 8:15; Rom 2:1; 14:3–4, 10, 13; Jas </p>
<p>4:12). is ts with the following descriptions that relate the judgment to </p>
<p>matters of food and drink or with regard to a feast or a New Moon or </p>
<p>a Sabbath. e triadic formula (feasts, New Moon, and Sabbath) occurs </p>
<p>in the Septuagint and represents the commandments of the Torah.</p>
