<p>Church as a whole which is lacking. He does so by being a mis-</p>
<p>sionary to the Gentiles. As his mission actually helped to shorten </p>
<p>the time before the parousia, the suerings he encountered as a </p>
<p>missionary to the Gentiles served to shorten the time of the messi-</p>
<p>anic woes (cf. Matt 24:21f) . . . is explains how Paul could speak </p>
<p>of his suerings being for the Colossians among whom he had </p>
<p>never worked personally. ey were “aictions” because of the </p>
<p>identity between Christ and his messenger (cf. 2 Cor 5:20). Paul, </p>
<p>as the Servant of the Lord, promoted the coming of the day of the </p>
<p>Lord by nishing the Gentile mission, which is a prerequisite of </p>
<p>the revelation of the man of lawlessness and the subsequent com-</p>
<p>ing of the Lord linked with the salvation of all of Israel.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>us, the messianic woes continue to be absorbed by the body of the </p>
<p>Messiah, who continues the work of providing a suering witness and so </p>
<p>completes the role that was unfullled at the rst advent of the Messiah. </p>
<p>Paul sees himself as playing a signicant part in making up this deciency </p>
<p>through the travails experienced in his apostolic ministry. In fact, Paul </p>
<p>reduces the aiction of others such as those in Colossae by absorbing </p>
<p>more than his fair share of the corporate suerings.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Yet in these same</p>
<p>suerings emerges the victory of God’s kingdom in the service of his </p>
cracked and broken vessels of divine grace. As John Chrysostom wrote,
<p>Paul’s ministry included a mixture of “carnage and trophies.”</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>What is</p>
<p>more, as James Dunn notes, for such a theology to be realistic Paul would </p>
<p>still have to be alive at the time of writing.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Paul goes on to state another element of his apostolate that is for their </p>
<p>benet. He was given the commission of God in order to fulll the word </p>
<p>of God. Paul’s commission has the sense of a task, vocation, stewardship, </p>
or oce uniquely given to him as part of his divinely ordained role in the
<p>revelation of the gospel to the Gentiles (see 1 Cor 4:1; 9:17; Eph 1:10; 3:2, </p>
<p>9). His raison d’être, so to speak, was to make the word of God fully and </p>
<p>widely known (Gal 1:16; Acts 22:21; 26:17). e word is fullled by its </p>
<p>eusion into the world (against the niv’s rendering, “word of God in all </p>
<p>its fullness”). e Colossians benet as recipients of the word of God (see </p>
