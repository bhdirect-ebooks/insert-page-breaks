<p>e Supremacy of Messiah in Creation and Reconciliation</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>persuade the Colossians of the suciency and supremacy of the Messiah </p>
<p>over all things in creation and make him the exclusive agent of salvation. </p>
<p>Socially the poem functions here to reinforce the ideological boundar-</p>
<p>ies between the “faith” of the Pauline churches and the deviance of the </p>
<p>philosophy that devalues the place of Christ in the cosmological order.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Indeed, Paul’s inclusion of this poem is intended as a polemic primar-</p>
<p>ily against a particular cosmology upon which the teachers’ aberrant </p>
<p>Christology is based. e issue is far more than, “Is Jesus God or is he only </p>
quasi-divine?” More appropriately, it asks what place Jesus occupies in
<p>the cosmological order in relation to the one God of Israel, and to various </p>
<p>spiritual entities with varying degrees of power and authority as well.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e poem is deployed here in aid of creating a symbolic universe that </p>
<p>is dened chiey by a “christological monotheism” over and against the </p>
<p>angelology of the philosophy.</p>

<p>All this through a short piece of primitive</p>
<p>Christian hymnody!</p>
<p>The Supremacy of the Messiah in Creation (1:15–16)</p>
<p>e content in vv. 12–14 might represent a piece of traditional material </p>
<p>like a baptismal liturgy, but it is impossible to tell its origins and func-</p>
<p>tion.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Paul proceeds to include some traditional material</p>
<p>in vv. 15–20. Verses 15–17 focus specically on the Messiah’s relation to </p>
<p>creation. Paul begins with He is the image of the invisible God. Image </p>
<p>(eikōn) conveys the sense of that which has the same form as something </p>
<p>else.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Jesus has the same form or reection as God, which is reminiscent</p>
<p>of Phil 2:6, where Jesus was in the “form of God” prior to his incarna-</p>
<p>12. Cf. Wright 1991: 118.</p>
<p>13. According to Dunn (1996: 97), Paul moves from a “cosmology of creation to a </p>
<p>cosmology of reconciliation.”</p>
<p>14. On a symbolic universe in Colossians see MacDonald 2008: 68–70; Talbert </p>
<p>2007: 192–93.</p>
<p>15. On 1:12–14 as traditional material see Cannon 1983: 12–19. He writes: “While </p>
<p>the traditional character of 1:12–14 cannot be proved with certainty, the evidence points </p>
<p>to the probability of such a conclusion. e opening participle eucharistountes points </p>
<p>to the confessional character of these verses. e change of pronouns and the style and </p>
<p>language strongly suggest that the writer drew on an outside source. And nally, the </p>
<p>manner in which the concepts related to the Exodus motif are presented intimate the </p>
<p>sacrament of baptism as the source of the homology” (19).</p>
