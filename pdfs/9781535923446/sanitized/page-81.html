<p>Col 1:5; 3:16) and as characters in the theodrama of salvation in which </p>
<p>they have been destined to participate.</p>
<p>e ow of thought is then interrupted with some remarks about </p>
the manifestation of the divine mystery.
<p>10</p>
<p> e background to the mys-</p>
<p>tery (mystērion) is not in the mystery cults or in Gnosticism,</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>but comes</p>
<p>from apocalyptic Judaism where “mystery” denoted an intimation of </p>
divinely foreordained events that have been deliberately concealed by
<p>God (e.g., Dan 2:18–19, 27–30; 1 En. 51:3; 103:2; at Qumran the Teacher </p>
<p>of Righteousness was known as an interpreter of wonderful mysteries, </p>
<p>1QpHab 7:4–5; cf. 1QM 3:9; 1QS 3:21–23). In Paul’s unique reckoning </p>
<p>this mystery is revealed not in the future, but in the recent past, a se-</p>
<p>cret now manifested and broadcast in the preached word of Jesus.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>mystery is also focused on the Gentiles as recipients of the knowledge </p>
<p>that salvation has come to them through the indwelling of the Messiah </p>
<p>so that they now share in the riches of this glorious mystery (see Eph </p>
<p>1:9; 3:4–6; 6:19). What is so glorious is not the prospect of a disembodied </p>
<p>soul one day departing to go to heaven; the glory consists in looking into </p>
<p>a hidden plan devised before the ages with the same sense of excitement </p>
<p>as children exploring the treasure troves of a lavish palace in a lost city.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e concern here pertains to the demystifying of the secret things of God </p>
<p>and the disclosure of his plan to bring the Gentiles into the people of God. </p>
<p>All this comes through the Messiah taking up residence in and among the </p>
<p>nations as the ultimate means to their glory (see Rom 11:25; 16:25–26).</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e mystery is Messiah in you, which is then rened further as the hope </p>
<p>10. On mystērion in Paul see the judicious study of Bockmuehl 1990.</p>
<p>11. Cf. McL. Wilson (2005: 175): “As for mystērion itself, too much should not be </p>
<p>read into the use of this word, in the sense of inuence from the mystery religions on a </p>
<p>nascent Christianity.”</p>
<p>12. Lohse 1971: 74. See also 1QS 11.5–8 where the mystery refers to an event that </p>
<p>has already taken place, such as the Qumran community’s participation in the angelic </p>
<p>assembly (Lincoln 2000: 615). A similar link of “mystery” and angel worship could be </p>
<p>propagated by the teachers at Colossae.</p>
<p>13. Wright 1986: 92.</p>
<p>14. According to Bruce (1957: 218 n. 168) there are two distinct, but related aspects </p>
<p>to the mystery in Ephesians and Colossians. In Colossians it is the fact that the indwelling </p>
<p>of Messiah is for Gentiles as well as Jews. Whereas in Ephesians, the mystery is that in </p>
<p>the Messiah, Gentile believers are fellow heirs with Jewish believers. Dunn (1996: 121) </p>
<p>comments: “For as Eph. 3:4–6 shows, the two thoughts (the mystery of Jew and Gentile </p>
<p>together as recipients of God’s saving grace and the mystery of Christ) are two aspects of </p>
the same larger divine plan as Paul had come to see it.” See also Moule 1957: 82–83.
