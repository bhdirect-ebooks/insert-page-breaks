<p>moral sensibilities. We desperately want Paul to speak out directly against </p>
<p>it and we are scandalized that he did not do so. Space prohibits us from </p>
<p>entering into a lengthy discussion of slavery in antiquity. By one deni-</p>
<p>tion a slave was a person who did not have the right of refusal. Some </p>
<p>people voluntarily sold themselves into slavery in order to avoid a deathly </p>
<p>poverty, and many slaves enjoyed good living conditions during their </p>
<p>service and were even rewarded with emancipation. Yet in the ancient </p>
<p>world a slave was regarded as a piece of human property and susceptible </p>
<p>to manifold forms of abuse and exploitation (particularly vulnerable were </p>
<p>women and children). Many were forced into slavery as a result of cap-</p>
<p>ture from war—both combatants and civilians—and some were born into </p>
<p>slavery. In major urban centers up to one third of the population were </p>
<p>slaves. Four points need to be mentioned:</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>(1) Slavery was indelibly part</p>
<p>of the social structure, welfare system, and economic activity of the an-</p>
<p>cient world and no one seems to have envisaged the operation of society </p>
<p>without the institution of slavery. While the moral treatment of slaves was </p>
<p>discussed on a philosophical plane, the fact of slavery was never debated </p>
<p>and its necessity was simply assumed. (2) In the absence of a modern de-</p>
<p>mocracy and libertarian ethics it would have been impossible to lodge an </p>
<p>eective and successful political protest against slavery. (3) e most ef-</p>
<p>fective means of ameliorating the slave’s plight was through just and kind </p>
<p>treatment by a master, with the hope of manumission at a future point, </p>
<p>and the prospect of remaining under the master’s patronage and provi-</p>
<p>sion as a freedman or freedwoman. (4) In 1 Cor 7:21 (“Were you a slave </p>
<p>when you were called? Don’t let it trouble you—although if you can gain </p>
<p>your freedom, do so”) Paul seems to urge slaves not to accept the status </p>
<p>quo, but seek to improve their condition and achieve their freedom where </p>
<p>possible. Moreover, in the epistle to Philemon, Paul urges Philemon to </p>
<p>accept Onesimus in a way that radically alters the slave-master relation-</p>
<p>ship. It is their ctive kinship as brothers in Messiah and coworkers for </p>
<p>the kingdom that transcends societal norms and also transforms their </p>
<p>attitudes, actions, and responses towards each other with a decidedly </p>
<p>Christian ethic. F. F. Bruce notes that the epistle to Philemon “brings us </p>
<p>into an atmosphere in which the institution of slavery could only wilt and </p>
<p>die.”</p>

<p>have had William Wilberforce.</p>
