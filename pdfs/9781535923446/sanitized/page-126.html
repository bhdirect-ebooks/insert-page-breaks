<p>christian hOuses in pagan cities </p>
<p>(3:18 —4 :1)</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Wives, submit to your husbands as is tting in the Lord.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them. </p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Children, obey your parents in every respect, for this is</p>
<p>pleasing in the Lord. </p>
<p>21</p>
<p> Fathers, do not antagonize your chil-</p>
<p>dren, lest they become disheartened. </p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Slaves, obey in every</p>
<p>respect those who are your earthly masters, not only when </p>
<p>they are watching, as people-pleasers, but with sincerity of </p>
<p>heart, fearing the Lord. </p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Whatever you do, work heartily,</p>
<p>as to the Lord and not for men, </p>
<p>24</p>
<p>knowing that from the</p>
<p>Lord you will receive the reward of inheritance. It is the Lord </p>
<p>Messiah you are serving. </p>
<p>25</p>
<p>For the wrongdoer will receive</p>
<p>back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality. </p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Masters, treat your slaves justly and fairly, knowing that you </p>
<p>also have a Lord-Master in heaven.</p>
<p>Aer the ethical admonitions of 3:1–17, Paul provides some further </p>
<p>teaching in 3:18—4:1 about Christian households. is section does not </p>
<p>seem to be linked to the teaching of the “philosophy” but comprises a </p>
<p>general piece of exhortation about how to live as Christians in a pagan </p>
<p>majority environment.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>We do not know for certain how many Christian</p>
<p>households there were in Colossae or the Lycus Valley. We know of at </p>
<p>least two house churches in Colossae, operating under the benefaction </p>
<p>of Philemon and his wife Apphia (Phlm 1–2), and another in Laodicea </p>
<p>under the benefaction (and leadership?) of Nympha (Col 4:15; cf. other </p>
<p>1. Cf. in contrast MacDonald (2008: 160, 167), who sees the household code as op-</p>
<p>posed to the false teaching by reinforcing the Colossians’ identity as a spiritual body of </p>
<p>believers.</p>
