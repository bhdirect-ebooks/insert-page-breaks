<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Rome. Yet the Marcionite prologue declares it written from Ephesus. To </p>
<p>add further complications the Marcionite prologue places the composi-</p>
<p>tion of Philemon and Ephesians in Rome. Even if we take into account </p>
<p>the movements of Paul’s coworkers according to the Pauline letters and </p>
<p>Acts, the evidence still remains ambiguous.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>e internal evidence of</p>
<p>Colossians and Philemon themselves are not decisive, nor does taking </p>
<p>into account the wider New Testament provide us with a clear cut answer. </p>
<p>Instead, we have to weigh the arguments for and against an Ephesian or </p>
<p>Roman setting.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>Roman Setting: Pro and Con. In favor of a Roman provenance is that </p>
<p>we know Paul did experience a prolonged period of imprisonment in </p>
<p>Rome, which is attested by Acts (Acts 28:16) and other early Christian </p>
<p>literature.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>e letter to the Philippians was also written from captivity</p>
<p>and many think it sent from Rome (Phil 1:13–14). Unfortunately, there </p>
<p>is no clear reference to a Roman imprisonment in the undisputed letters </p>
<p>of Paul, which is no small fact, and must be taken into consideration. </p>
<p>Second, in Phlm 9 Paul calls himself an “old man,” which suggests that it </p>
<p>was written at the end of his life. However, this might be a phrase used </p>
<p>rhetorically to get Philemon to respect his elder and the apostle. ird, </p>
<p>and perhaps the strongest argument for a Roman provenance, is that the </p>
<p>theology of Colossians seems to represent a maturation and development </p>
<p>37. (1) Timothy can be placed in Ephesus (Acts 19:22; 1 Cor 16:10; 1 Tim 1:3) but </p>
<p>not Rome (unless Phil 1:1 was written from Rome). (2) Tychicus is linked to Rome and </p>
<p>Ephesus (2 Tim 4:12) but towards the end of Paul’s imprisonment. (3) Aristarchus was </p>
<p>apparently in Ephesus during the riot there (Acts 19:29) and he probably sailed onto </p>
<p>Rome with Paul (Acts 27:2). (4) Demas is only linked with Paul in his nal imprisonment </p>
<p>and noted for his desertion (2 Tim 4:10). (5) If Luke was Paul’s travelling companion af-</p>
<p>ter Troas (Acts 16:11) he may have been with Paul in Ephesus and probably accompanied </p>
<p>him to Rome, hence “we came to Rome” (Acts 28:14, 16; cf. 2 Tim 4:11). (6) John Mark </p>
<p>had broken o from Paul (Acts 15:37–41) during an earlier missionary journey so the </p>
<p>reference to him with Paul in Col 4:10 and Phlm 24 is all the more peculiar. It means that </p>
<p>reconciliation has probably occurred. He is placed in Rome by 1 Pet 5:13 and in Ephesus </p>
<p>by 2 Tim 4:11.</p>
<p>38. For a Roman setting see, e.g., Kümmel 1975: 347–48; O’Brien 1982: xlix–liv; </p>
<p>Dunn 1996: 41; Gorman 2004: 478; Witherington 2007: 22–24; and for an Ephesian set-</p>
<p>ting, e.g., Lohse 1971: 166–67 (for Philemon); Martin 1973: 30; Schweizer 1982: 25–26; </p>
<p>Wright 1986: 34–39; Stuckenbruck 2003: 127; deSilva 2004: 668 (for Philemon).</p>
<p>39. e Pastoral Epistles (if authentic) also testify to a second Roman imprisonment </p>
<p>(2 Tim 1:17), but Colossians could not have been written during a second Roman im-</p>
<p>prisonment since Timothy was in Ephesus at this time and unable to be cosender of the </p>
<p>letter to the Colossians.</p>
