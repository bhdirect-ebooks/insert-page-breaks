<p>New Testament inheritance (usually klēronomia) has a decidedly non-</p>
<p>geographic meaning and is synonymous with salvation (Eph 1:14, 18), </p>
<p>the future expression of the kingdom (Eph 5:5), eternal life (Heb 9:15; </p>
<p>11:8), heaven (1 Pet 1:4), and a heavenly reward (Col 3:24). In line with </p>
<p>Col 3:24, this “inheritance” or “lot” (klēros) is probably to be identied </p>
<p>with a transcendent reward associated with sharing in the saints in the </p>
<p>light. is is an enigmatic phrase and some translations seek to remove </p>
<p>the strangeness by adding “kingdom of light,” which is not in the Greek </p>
<p>text (niv). e addition of “kingdom” is understandable given the refer-</p>
<p>ence to the “kingdom” of the Son in v. 14. If the saints are believers (see </p>
<p>1:4, 26) then the parallel in Ephesians is quite relevant and this refers to </p>
<p>“his glorious inheritance among the saints” (Eph 1:18; cf. 5:5). Paul might </p>
<p>be saying no more than that the Colossians have a part in the glorious </p>
<p>inheritance of God’s people in the heavenlies. But two things count in </p>
<p>favor of an alternative proposal. First, saints or “holy ones” (hagioi) can </p>
<p>also refer to angels (e.g., Zech 14:5; 1 En. 1:9; Pss. Sol. 17:43; 1QS 11:7–8; </p>
<p>cf. 1 ess 3:13; 2 ess 1:10). Second, light (phōs) is an odd qualication </p>
<p>for “saints” unless it refers to their transcendent and glorious destiny (e.g., </p>
<p>Rev 21:24). However, light is also associated with angels (Acts 12:7; 2 Cor </p>
<p>11:14; 1QS 3:20) and light is something that comes from heaven during </p>
<p>visions and visitations (Acts 9:3; 22:6; 26:13; Tob 5:10). Given the debate </p>
<p>about the worship of/with angels in Col 2:18, Paul might be suggesting </p>
<p>that believers have been qualied to inherit the rights and privileges nor-</p>
<p>mally given to angelic beings.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>e Lord is then dened as the one who delivered us from the do-</p>
<p>minion of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of the Son of his </p>
<p>love. is short but tightly packed expression exhibits a number of key </p>
<p>Pauline themes. First, there is an apocalyptic orientation as believers have </p>
<p>been rescued from malevolent spiritual forces bound up with the current </p>
<p>age (see Gal 1:4; Col 2:15). Second, we have here the language of wide </p>
<p>scale transportation as the word transferred (methistēmi) can be used </p>
<p>in regards to the transplantation of entire peoples (Josephus Ant. 9.235). </p>
<p>God has picked up his people and transplanted them into a whole new </p>
<p>territory. Paul frames salvation in terms reminiscent of the exodus where </p>
<p>believers experience a new exodus and a new redemption by entering into </p>
<p>15. Cf. Lohse 1971: 35; Martin 1973: 54; Sappington 1991: 199; MacDonald 2008: 50; </p>
<p>contra Harris 1991: 34; Barth and Blanke 1994: 186; Dunn 1996: 76–77; Witherington </p>
<p>2007: 125 n. 22.</p>
