<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>

<p>generally “palace guard” or “military headquarters” (Matt 27:27; Mark </p>
<p>15:16; John 18:28, 33; 19:9; Acts 23:35). And “Caesar’s household” might </p>
<p>denote the imperial sta stationed at an imperial residence in Ephesus </p>
<p>since this was also the Roman capital of western Asia. Given the rancor-</p>
<p>ous language in Philippians, debates with Paul’s opponents in Galatia and </p>
<p>Corinth still seem very recent (e.g., Phil 3:2–11, 18–19). It is also unlikely </p>
<p>that Roman prisoners would be incarcerated in the emperor’s own resi-</p>
<p>dence. Furthermore, there is no reference to Timothy accompanying Paul </p>
<p>to Rome in Acts 28, but he is placed in Ephesus during Paul’s extended </p>
<p>ministry there (1 Cor 16:8–10). We also know from Acts that Timothy </p>
<p>engaged in one or more trips to Greece and Macedonia from Ephesus </p>
<p>(Acts 19:22). us, Paul’s intent to send Timothy to Philippi (Phil 2:19) is </p>
<p>more likely to comport with his travels to Greece and Macedonia during </p>
<p>Paul’s stay in Ephesus than during Paul’s imprisonment in Rome.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>An</p>
<p>Ephesian provenance for Philippians seems slightly more probable. As I </p>
<p>see it, then, this is how it all stands:</p>
<p>For Rome: </p>

<p>and, if so, Timothy’s presence with Paul in Rome is thereby es-</p>
<p>tablished since he was a cosender of the letter to the Philippians. </p>
<p>e Paul–Timothy–Rome connection can then be linked with </p>
<p>the letters to Philemon and to the Colossians.</p>
