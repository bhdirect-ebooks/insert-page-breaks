<p>Fusing the Horizons: Christological Assertions</p>
<p>One could write, teach, preach, or discuss this text for hours and still only </p>
<p>scratch the surface of its theological depth. We are presented with a theo-</p>
<p>logical kaleidoscope that blends cosmology, Christology, and soteriology in the </p>
<p>one hit. In a sense, we could say that a major purpose of the poem is to praise </p>
<p>Jesus Christ and to correct aberrant and competing portraits of his person and </p>
<p>work. But it is far more than that, as Dunn colorfully writes:</p>
<p>The vision is vast. The claim is mind-blowing. It says much for </p>
<p>the faith of these ﬁrst Christians that they should see in Christ’s </p>
<p>death and resurrection quite literally the key to resolving the dis-</p>
<p>harmonies of nature and the inhumanities of humankind, that the </p>
<p>character of God’s creation and God’s concern for the universe </p>
<p>in its fullest expression could be so caught and encapsulated for </p>
<p>them in the cross of Christ . . . In some ways still more strik-</p>
<p>ing is the implied vision of the church as the focus and means </p>
<p>towards this cosmic reconciliation—the community in which that </p>
<p>reconciliation has already taken place (or begun to take place) and </p>
<p>whose responsibility it is to live out . . . as well as to proclaim its </p>
<p>secret (cf. 4:2–6).</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>The mileage one gets from this poem is not merely to make sure Christians </p>
<p>believe the right stuff about Jesus, but to see Jesus and ourselves as part </p>
<p>of the story of creation and reconciliation. The story of the church and of </p>
individual Christians themselves is written up in a narrative of a world made
<p>good, gone wrong, and being put right. It is part of a narrative tapestry related </p>
<p>to the promises made to Abraham coming true at last in the cosmopolitan </p>
<p>people belonging to Israel’s Messiah. It encompasses human rebellion and </p>
divine reconciliation. It is a drama of despots and tyrants, spiritual and human
<p>(they were not always distinguished in the Bible),</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>being defeated through</p>
<p>the blood of the cross.</p>
<p>There is no shirking away from the obvious christological assertions made </p>
<p>here. The devotion of Christians is not offered to a cultic ﬁgure, but to the Lord </p>
<p>through whom and for whom the world was made. It is stupendous that the </p>
