<p>of Pauline thought. is is attributable no doubt to Paul’s own theological </p>
<p>reection on Christology and ecclesiology, but also to the interpretation </p>
<p>of Paul’s thought that began with his coworkers like Timothy and had </p>
<p>already started to weave its way into the letter. Still, this does not neces-</p>
<p>sitate a later date aer Paul’s death, since Paul’s theology clearly developed </p>
<p>somewhat during the short time span between Galatians (ca. 49 CE) and </p>
<p>Romans (ca. 55–56 CE). We do not know how much of the so-called de-</p>
<p>veloped theology of Colossians is attributable to the interpretive insights </p>
<p>of Paul’s coworkers and their inferences about Paul’s theology, which could </p>
<p>have been made from any location or residence with time for writing and </p>
<p>reection. Fourth, Rome would be a very good place for a runaway slave </p>
<p>to hide in the massive population of the city, yet it was also a long way to </p>
<p>travel (approximately 1200 miles by sea) when other cities in Asia Minor </p>
<p>and Syria such as Ephesus and Antioch were nearer and large enough to </p>
<p>aord a veil of protection. Fih, a Roman setting was the preferred view </p>
<p>of patristic authors, but it was not unanimous, and constitutes tertiary </p>
<p>evidence at best.</p>
<p>Ephesian Setting: Pro and Con. e case for an Ephesian setting is </p>
<p>strengthened by accounts that place Paul there more than once (1 Cor </p>
<p>16:8; Acts 18:19–21 and esp. 19:1–20:1) and for three years during his </p>
<p>Aegean mission (Acts 19:8–10). at Paul experienced imprisonment in </p>
<p>Ephesus is arguably implied in 2 Cor 1:8 where the apostle refers to the </p>
<p>hardships experienced by him and his companions in Asia, and also in </p>
<p>1 Cor 15:32 where Paul speaks metaphorically of ghting wild beasts in </p>
<p>Ephesus.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> However, there is no clear evidence for an Ephesian imprison-</p>
<p>ment in Paul’s letters or in Acts. Second, it can be argued that Ephesus and </p>
<p>Colossae, only one hundred miles apart, make far more plausible the ight </p>
<p>of Onesimus, the delegation of Tychicus/Onesimus, any travels back and </p>
<p>forth by Epaphras, the forthcoming visit of John Mark, and the possible </p>
<p>visit of Paul to Philemon. is urry of comings and goings is more likely </p>
<p>than a series of lengthy sea journeys that were dangerous and took weeks </p>
<p>or months at a time. ird, Paul’s request in Phlm 22 that a guest room </p>
<p>be prepared for him is more realistic given an Ephesian imprisonment. If </p>
<p>it was Paul’s plan to go further west aer his release from connement in </p>
<p>Rome, then a journey to Colossae to visit Philemon would have meant </p>
<p>40. A number of Pauline chronologists (e.g., Knox 1950: 71; Jewett 1979: 103; </p>
<p>Lüdemann 1984: 263; Riesner 1998: 213–16) either support or allow the possibility of </p>
<p>an Ephesian imprisonment.</p>
