<p>teaching and admonishing each other in all wisdom, singing </p>

<p>e material in 3:1–17 is a distinct unit that is premised on the reality </p>
<p>of union with Messiah and the various imperatives that such a union </p>
creates for the individual believer and for the new covenant community.
<p>is provides a natural progression from the preceding section in 2:8–23, </p>
<p>where Paul has argued that the Colossians are not indebted to the hy-</p>
<p>brid Hellenism and Jewish mysticism of the teachers with their system </p>
<p>of heavenly intermediaries, asceticism, and coercive practice of Torah </p>
<p>observances. Paul is advocating a competing moral vision to the con-</p>
<p>straining tendencies of the teachers.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Additionally, Paul is pointing out</p>
<p>that freedom from Torah does not mean freedom from any kind of moral </p>
<p>obligation. As Paul does elsewhere, such as in Romans (6:1–23; 7:1–6; </p>
<p>8:1–16; 12:1–2) and Galatians (5:13–6:10), he follows up his theological </p>
<p>explication of the message of salvation with a behavioral discourse con-</p>
<p>cerning the way that believers and the communities that they constitute </p>
<p>are to live in view of so great a salvation. is is known generally as the in-</p>
<p>dicative and the imperative of Pauline ethics—because you are united with </p>
<p>Messiah you are no longer to oer your bodies to the service of sin. As </p>
<p>believers live between the triumph of Christ’s death and the manifestation </p>
<p>of his glory at his Parousia, they struggle against the esh and the powers </p>
<p>in the time in between. us, the bulk of the material in 3:1–17 functions </p>
<p>rhetorically as an exhortation focusing on the transformative nature of </p>
<p>the gospel as they live between the ages. Paul’s gospel is transformative </p>
<p>in the sense of rstly transporting believers from darkness to light (Col </p>
<p>1:13–14) and from death to life (Col 3:3–4), and secondly by giving them </p>
<p>a new identity in Jesus Christ (Col 2:6–7, 11; 3:11). Charles Moule put it </p>
<p>well: “us, the new life is a fait accompli because of Christ: it is a free gi </p>
<p>1. On a link between the exhortation in Col 3:1—4:6 and the argument against the </p>
<p>teachers in 2:6–23, see also Sappington 1991: 143; Wall 1993: 129; Hartman 1995: 189–</p>
