<p>is met by Paul’s appeal to the unity of Greek and Jew in the Messiah. e </p>
<p>esoteric nature of the teachers’ instruction is matched by Paul’s incorpo-</p>
<p>ration of Barbarian and Scythian into the Christian fold.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>at again cuts</p>
<p>at the view that the Colossians should seek either the prestige or protec-</p>
<p>tion associated with taking on certain Jewish customs. e new creation </p>
<p>fosters a unique bond with Jesus Christ and, by consequence, a unique </p>
<p>bond with other Christians (see 2 Cor 5:17; 1 Cor 12:13). Christians </p>
<p>are the renewed human race and the new eschatological humanity that </p>
<p>model before the world what God had always intended for humans to be: </p>
<p>a loving community unied in worship of their Creator. is is followed </p>
<p>with a short parenthetical remark that Messiah is for all and in all.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>grammar is quite awkward, and Paul has expressed similar thoughts else-</p>
<p>where, though mainly with God as the subject (Rom 11:36; 1 Cor 15:28; </p>
<p>Eph 1:23; 4:6). In the Greek text there is no verb “is” between “Messiah” </p>
<p>and “all” (lit. “all and in all Messiah”). In light of the preceding text it </p>
<p>would seem peculiar to think that Paul is saying that Messiah is Jew and </p>
<p>Gentile, circumcision and uncircumcised, etc. e Messiah possesses a </p>
<p>relation to the categories of persons just named, but not in the sense of </p>
<p>mystically being what they all are at once; more likely, the relation that </p>
<p>Messiah has to all races and classes resides in the benets that his faithful-</p>
<p>ness, passion, and exaltation confers on each of them. Jesus’s death is “for </p>
<p>us” (e.g., 1 ess 5:10; Rom 5:8; and esp. 2 Cor 5:14) and Jesus intercedes </p>
<p>“for us” from the heavenly throne room (Rom 8:31–34). Hence, Jesus is </p>
<p>for all whether Jew or Gentile, slave or free, male or female. Unlike Caesar, </p>
<p>Messiah is not kurios (“Lord”) for the benet of his own self-aggrandize-</p>
<p>ment, but Lord for the benet of others. In fact, we can also detect in 3:11 </p>
<p>some additional counter-imperial whispers. Augustus’s Res gestae (“things </p>
<p>accomplished,” cited on his funeral inscription) listed among his exploits </p>
<p>a triumphal Roman cosmopolitanism that fullled Alexander the Great’s </p>
<p>incomplete program of bringing the world into trans-ethnic unity based </p>
<p>on military conquest, political incorporation, and cultural assimilation.</p>

<p>Rather, the basis for a shared unity emerges from a common savior who </p>

<p>35. Lightfoot (1879: 219) wrote: “Christ has dispossessed and obliterated all distinc-</p>
<p>tions of religious prerogative and intellectual preeminence and social caste; Christ has </p>
<p>substituted Himself for all of these; Christ occupies the whole sphere of human life and </p>
<p>permeates all its developments.”</p>
