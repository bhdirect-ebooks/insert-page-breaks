<p>Colossians 1:24—2:7</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>Paul continues the line of thought begun in 1:23 about his apostolic min-</p>
<p>istry. Paul has given his ministry a cosmic context, but here he attributes </p>
<p>to it an apocalyptic function as well. at functions consists of absorbing </p>
<p>part of the messianic woes or the travails that fall upon God’s people before </p>
<p>the nal consummation. Such a task is even described as a completion of </p>
<p>Jesus’s own work. e main themes in this section are the suering and </p>
<p>struggle of the apostolic mission (1:24, 29; 2:1) and the manifestation of </p>
<p>God’s mystery in the Messiah (1:26–27; 2:2). e nal verses (2:4–7) close </p>
<p>o this section as an exhortation to avoid deception, to remain faithful </p>
<p>in their way of life, and to trust in the Messiah. at itself forms a tting </p>
<p>prelude to Paul’s admonition against the Colossian teachers in 2:8–23. </p>
<p>Paul is not simply reinforcing the believers’ “self-esteem,”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> but is reinforc-</p>
<p>ing the primary theological xtures of their faith and reinvigorating their </p>
<p>privileges in a shared Christian identity.</p>
<p>Messianic Woes and the Mystery of the Messiah (1:24–27)</p>
<p>Paul continues on from Col 1:23 about the gospel the Colossians have </p>
<p>heard and which Paul serves. He adds, I rejoice in my suerings on </p>
<p>your behalf. ese suerings are probably the trials, misfortunes, and </p>
<p>persecutions referred to elsewhere in Paul’s letters (see 1 Cor 4:11–13; </p>
<p>2 Cor 1:3–11; 11:23–30; Phil 1:12–14, 20–26; Acts 9:16) and include </p>
<p>synagogue beatings, guratively facing wild beasts, shipwreck, stoning, </p>
<p>imprisonment, and other calamities.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>ese suerings are said to be on</p>
<p>your behalf or “for you,” but how is this so? Are Paul’s suerings vicarious </p>
<p>and redemptive? On the one hand, these suerings benet the churches </p>
<p>because they are what Paul and his coworkers endure in order to preach </p>
<p>the gospel to the world and so his suerings evidently benet others. On </p>
<p>the other hand, Paul clearly goes further than that when he states, in my </p>
<p>esh I am lling up what is lacking in the aictions of the Messiah, </p>
<p>which is also “for” or on behalf of the church. Does Paul perfect or cor-</p>
<p>rect a deciency in the atoning suerings of Jesus?</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Or does Paul see the</p>

<p>3. Calvin (1979a: 166) quotes Augustine’s words on the Gospel of John: “ough we </p>
<p>brethren die for brethren, yet there is no blood of any martyr that is poured out for the </p>
<p>remission of sins. is Christ did for us. Nor has he in this conferred upon us a matter of </p>
<p>imitation, but ground of thanksgiving.”</p>
