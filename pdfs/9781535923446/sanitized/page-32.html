<p> Furthermore, some Jews were known to practice magic as evi-</p>
<p>denced by Bar-Jesus/Elymas who, according to Acts, was something of a </p>
<p>personal attendant or chaplain to Sergius Paulus on the island of Cyprus </p>
<p>(Acts 13:6–12). e second century Christian polemicist Celsus men-</p>
<p>tioned Jews “who worship angels and are addicted to sorcery of which </p>
<p>Moses was their teacher.”</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>Clinton Arnold has shown how angels were</p>
<p>important in ancient magic for protection and petitions.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> ere is an in-</p>
<p>scription from Phrygia concerning a Jewish lady, Julia Severa, who was a </p>
<p>synagogue benefactor and a priestess of the imperial cult.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>At the same time, the argument for a syncretistic Judaism in Asia </p>
<p>Minor can be overstated. Josephus records that most Jews in Asia Minor </p>
<p>strictly observed the laws about food and festivals and came into conict </p>
<p>with their Gentile neighbors because of their faithfulness to the Jewish </p>
<p>way of life.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>Paul Trebilco states, “No evidence has arisen from this study</p>
<p>to suggest that Judaism in Asia minor was syncretistic or had been com-</p>
<p>promised by paganism.”</p>
<p>63</p>
<p> Similar is F. F. Bruce: “Some outward confor-</p>
<p>mity with pagan customs on the part of inuential Jews in Phrygia may be </p>
<p>taken as established; but it would be precarious to draw conclusions from </p>
<p>this about forms of syncretism that might be reected in the beliefs and </p>
<p>practices deprecated in Paul’s Epistle to the Colossians.”</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>We should also</p>
<p>be aware of the looseness of the term “syncretism.” What counts as syn-</p>
<p>cretism? For instance, according to the Mishnah tractate Abodah Zarah </p>
<p>a Jew is permitted to make and sell idols for a living (m. Abod. Zar. 1.8). </p>
<p>If one believes that Zeus is another name of Yahweh, is that syncretism </p>
<p>or pluralism (Ep. Arist. 16)? Some Jewish apocalyptic writings could </p>
<p>venerate angels like Metratron, the “little Yahwheh,” but without actually </p>
<p>compromising their Jewish beliefs in toto (3 En. 10:3; 12:5; 17:1–3; 30:1; </p>
<p>b. Sanh. 38b). In relation to Colossians, I would make two further points. </p>
<p>First, there is no reference to magic, amulets, spells, calling on angels, or </p>
<p>initiation rites in pagan temples. Second, there is a dierence between </p>
