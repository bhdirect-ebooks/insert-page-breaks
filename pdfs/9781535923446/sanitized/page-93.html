<p>Engaging the Empty Deceit of Mystic Judaism</p>

<p>e implications are largely eschatological and ethical. is circumcision </p>
<p>marks a moment of eschatologial fullment, as the Messiah has done for </p>
<p>the uncircumcised esh what the circumcision of the esh accomplished </p>
<p>for Israel. at marks the liberation of the circumcised and uncircum-</p>
<p>cised from the dark vestiges of the esh. is comes not from Torah, but </p>
<p>from Messiah.</p>

<p>Paul then mentions his second metaphor, baptism, which emblema-</p>
<p>tizes how believers were buried with him and also raised with him. e </p>
<p>imagery of baptism represents believers mimetically sharing in the event </p>
<p>of Jesus’s passion by descending into the waters as per his death and buri-</p>
<p>al and then surfacing from the waters marking his resurrection into new </p>
<p>life. e whole ritual served to highlight their experience of participation </p>
<p>in the Messiah’s passion and vivication by the Father (see Rom 6:4–6; </p>
<p>Eph 2:5–6). e instrument of this is faith in the operation of God. e </p>
<p>life-giving power of God in raising his Son from the dead is also operative </p>
<p>in the believer who has faith in the Messiah. Notable faith is directed to-</p>
<p>wards what God has done in the event of the death and resurrection of his </p>
<p>Son with attention given to its salvic benets. is baptismal symbolism </p>
<p>is equally applicable because the believers themselves, formerly pagans, </p>
<p>were dead in the trespasses and the uncircumcision of your esh and </p>
<p>thus alienated and hostile to their Creator. eir pre-faith state of being </p>
<p>uncircumcised in the esh as idol worshipping Gentiles wallowing in </p>
<p>death stands in marked contrast to their current state of being circum-</p>

<p>65; Hunt 1990: 241–42; Smith 2006: 144) see circumcision of the Messiah as referring to </p>
<p>Jesus’s death. is makes sense given that Paul refers to union with Messiah in circumci-</p>
<p>sion, burial, and resurrection in vv. 11–12, whereas in Romans 6 Paul refers to sharing </p>
<p>in Jesus’s death, burial, and resurrection. Yet I would maintain that (1) circumcision </p>
<p>of the Messiah is coordinate to putting o the body of esh and is the opposite of the </p>
<p>uncircumcision of your esh in v. 13. e content of v. 11 then does not stand for the </p>
<p>indicative (death of Jesus) and imperative (putting o evil deeds) elements, but under-</p>
<p>scores the transformative power of being in-Messiah. Paul is giving a messianic reword-</p>
<p>ing to “circumcision of the heart.” (2) e actual indicative aspect of Paul’s exhortation is </p>
<p>provided in vv. 12–15, while v. 11 states the reality that is created by Jesus’s triumphant </p>
<p>death. (3) Any attempt to nd an identical linear sequence akin to Romans 6 fails because </p>
<p>baptism in v. 12 encompasses death and resurrection with Jesus and in v. 13 it is their </p>
<p>spiritual death and spiritual quickening that is in view. (4) ere seems to be a two-stage </p>
<p>scheme of participation based on baptism/burial (= death) and resurrection in vv. 12–13, </p>
<p>and there is no wooden imitation of the pattern in Romans 6. See further Calvin1979a: </p>
