<p>Colossians 1:15–20</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>is passage is probably a Christian hymn or poem about Jesus </p>
<p>Christ. e use of relative clauses in verses 15 and 18 is indicative of other </p>
<p>confessional and hymnic materials in the New Testament (e.g., Rom </p>
<p>4:25; Phil 2:6; 1 Tim 3:16; Heb 1:3; 1 Pet 2:21–24). Paul is probably using </p>
<p>some traditional material given the unique vocabulary, the liturgical feel, </p>
<p>and the near intrusion of the text upon the immediate literary context. </p>
<p>However, it is almost impossible to gauge what the original “poem” was </p>
<p>and what Paul has added, subtracted, or rearranged.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>e religious-historical background of this pre-Pauline poem is dis-</p>
<p>puted in scholarship (some even suggest that it is a pre-Christian text </p>
<p>that has been taken up by Christians). First, there have been proposals </p>
<p>that the background to the poem lies in a gnostic redeemer myth where </p>
<p>an archetypal human comes to redeem the human race from corruption </p>
<p>and the mortal condition.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>is is improbable because: (1) ere is no</p>
<p>extant pre-Christian evidence of a gnostic redeemer who entered into the </p>
<p>world of darkness in order to redeem the sons of light by becoming the </p>
<p>“redeemed Redeemer.” ere was then no gnostic redeemer myth that </p>
<p>was waiting in the wings to be taken up, Christianized, and applied to </p>
<p>Jesus. is “redeemed Redeemer” is himself a “myth” of mid-twentieth-</p>
<p>century German scholarship. (2) It is not a “supra-historical” perspective </p>
<p>or elements of a “metaphysical drama” that typied Gnosticism, rather, </p>
<p>it was an “anti-cosmic dualism” that drove a wedge between the good </p>
<p>god of salvation and the malevolent god of creation that lay at the core </p>
<p>of Gnosticism. (3) A gnostic hymn would be unlikely to trace creation </p>
and reconciliation to the same divine being. (4) It is impossible to excise
<p>all Christian traits from the poem as “rstborn” and “reconcile” are near </p>
<p>technical Christian terms here. </p>
<p>Second, others have argued that it reects mediator gures from </p>
<p>Hellenistic Judaism, most notably personications of Wisdom extant in </p>
<p>Jewish wisdom literature (e.g., Sirach and Wisdom of Solomon) and the </p>
<p>Logos from Philo.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>e problem is that while the parallels with Wisdom</p>
<p>are numerous they are oen oblique. For example, Wisdom is oen re-</p>
<p>garded as a created entity (Prov 8:22–23; Sir 1:4, 9), whereas in the poem </p>
<p>2. If there is anything that might be distinctly Pauline here it is probably the reference </p>
<p>to the church as the “body” and the “blood of his cross.”</p>
