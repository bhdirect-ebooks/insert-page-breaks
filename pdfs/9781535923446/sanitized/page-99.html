<p>Engaging the Empty Deceit of Mystic Judaism</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>and reality, which impacted Hellenistic Judaism since the same concept is </p>
<p>found also in Philo.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>e Torah foreshadows and overtures the Messiah</p>
<p>who fullls the precepts of the law. For Greek-speakers shadows also had </p>
<p>negative connotations of instability, shiiness, weakness, and emptiness </p>
<p>(e.g., 1 Chr 29:15; Jas 1:17; Wis 5:9).</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>at the substance belongs to the</p>
<p>Messiah means that the reality posed by the shadow, and the fulllment of </p>
<p>what is to come, belongs to Jesus. is combines a Platonic idealism with a </p>
<p>Jewish eschatology and a focus on Jesus as the goal of Israel’s scriptures (see </p>
<p>Rom 10:4). e Messiah is the true “substance” of the Torah. erefore, </p>
<p>the law’s preparatory adumbrating function has come to an end because </p>
<p>the messianic “substance” to which the law pointed has now arrived.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>subject relates back to earlier assertions in 1:15–20 where Jesus exercises </p>
<p>the prerogative of God as Creator and Reconciler, and 2:9 where the full-</p>
<p>ness of deity dwells in Jesus. Hence, the incarnation marks the indwelling </p>
<p>of God in the body of the Messiah to be among his people.</p>
<p>Paul makes some additional cautionary words with Let no one dis-</p>
<p>qualify you, which is a further remark against letting people pass judg-</p>
<p>ment over them. e word for disqualify (katabrabeuō) can also have the </p>
<p>sense of “rob of a prize,”</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>and this sounds like someone trying to throw</p>
<p>them out of bounds during a match and eliminate them from a contest </p>
<p>(see Gal 5:7). e means through which they might be disqualied is </p>
<p>spelled out as giving way to those who insist upon ascetic practices and </p>
<p>worship of angels. e ascetic practices are indicative of humility or self-</p>
<p>mortication and probably pertain to fasting (Lev 16:29, 31; 23:27, 32; </p>
<p>Num 29:7; Ps 35:13; 69:10; Isa 58:3, 5; Jdt 4:9).</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Fasting was a precursor</p>
<p>31. Cf. Philo Conf. 69; Flacc. 165.</p>
<p>32. Gnilka 1980: 147.</p>
<p>33. Beale 2007: 862.</p>
<p>34. BDAG 515.</p>
<p>35. Alternatively, tapeinophrosunē could be translated as “humility,” and since “hu-</p>
<p>mility” and “worship” are governed by the same preposition en, it might be translated as </p>
<p>the “humility and worship of the angels” and refer to the angels’ prostration before God </p>
<p>in the act of heavenly worship (see O’Brien 1982: 142; Francis 1975: 180; Rowland 1983: </p>
<p>75; Harris 1991: 121; Sappington 1991: 158–61; Sumney 1993: 376–77; Smith 2006: 130). </p>
<p>However, tapeinophrosunē is a virtual technical term for fasting in the lxx (Lev 16:29, 31 </p>
<p>etc.) and early Christian literature (e.g., Tertullian Jejun. 12, Herm. Vis. 3.10.6; 5.3.7). In </p>
<p>Col 2:23 tapeinophrosun tē is linked with asceticism and the positive virtue of humility in </p>
<p>Col 3:12 (cf. Stettler 2005: 183). Arnold (1996: 53 [see also pp. 210–14]) points out that </p>
<p>in the Sepher Ha-Razim (“Book of Mysteries,” a collection of Jewish incantation texts) the </p>
<p>intercession of angels depends upon ritual purity.</p>
