<p>Introduction to Colossians and Philemon</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>A third view is that the slave Onesimus was sent to Paul by the church </p>
<p>of Colossae to provide provisions for the apostle, but Paul writes back </p>
<p>asking that Onesimus be permanently released to his team of coworkers </p>
<p>to assist in evangelization. Sarah Winter bases this largely on the high </p>
<p>frequency of commercial terminology in the letter as Paul seeks to have </p>
<p>Onesimus break all formal and legal ties with Philemon’s household.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>Finally, a fourth perspective is that Onesimus was not a slave at all, </p>
<p>but only a brother of Philemon, and Paul seeks to reconcile two estranged </p>
<p>brothers. Key to this position is understanding “as a slave” metaphorically, </p>
<p>whereas “as a beloved brother” is not metaphorical (v. 16). Paul refers to </p>
<p>the physical kinship of Onesimus and Philemon “in the esh” as well as </p>
<p>a ctive kinship “in the Lord” as the basis of their reconciliation. A. D. </p>
<p>Callahan writes: “When Paul exhorted Philemon to receive Onesimus no </p>
<p>longer as a slave, he was there commanding the former to desist in treat-</p>
<p>ing the latter as though he were beyond the pale of fraternal entitlements </p>
<p>to love, honor, and respect . . . In this short, diplomatic epistle Paul at-</p>
<p>tempted dely to heal a ri not between errant slave and irate master, but </p>
<p>between estranged Christian brothers.”</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> In light of this I conclude:</p>
<p>(a) Against option four that Onesimus and Philemon are brothers </p>
<p>is that the letter has far too much gravity and pathos for Paul simply to </p>
<p>be urging Philemon to treat Onesimus as a beloved brother. Fraternal </p>
<p>love is a major theme, but it exists between the two now only in light of </p>
<p>Onesimus’s conversion. Paul seems to use a dierent form of exhorta-</p>
<p>tion when he seeks reconciliation of equal persons within a community </p>
<p>(e.g., Phil 4:2; 2 Cor 2:5–11). It is the social inequality between the two, </p>
<p>deliberately complicated by Onesimus’s conversion,</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>that is the problem</p>
<p>in the reconciliation.</p>
<p>(b) Against option three that Paul seeks to have Onesimus released </p>
<p>to his service is that this view lacks any reasonable explanation of the </p>
<p>disruption between Onesimus and Philemon that is apparent in verses </p>
<p>15–19, and particularly the fact that the separation could have implied </p>
<p>kind heart, and do not torment him or yourself any longer—anger can only be a torment </p>
<p>to your gentle self” (trans. B. Radice [LCL]).</p>
<p>93. Cf. Winter 1987.</p>
<p>94. Callahan 1993: 371.</p>
<p>95. On Onesimus’s conversion we have to ask, did Onesimus go to Paul to gain lever-</p>
<p>age over his master and was a safe return to Philemon a contributing factor in Onesimus’s </p>
<p>conversion to faith in Jesus (see Barclay 1996: 102)?</p>
