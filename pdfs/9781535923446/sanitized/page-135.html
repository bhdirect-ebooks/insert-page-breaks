<p>Closing Words of Exhortation from a Missionary Friend</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>though Colossians has much to say in response to a perceived doctri-</p>
<p>nal threat, the letter is hardly doctrinaire and its content is permeated </p>
<p>with calls for thanksgiving, praise, prayer, and conduct betting God’s </p>
<p>holy people. Paul specically asks that prayer be oered for him and his </p>
<p>coworkers, that God may open a door for us, to declare the word, the </p>
<p>mystery of Messiah (on “doors” for mission work see 1 Cor 16:9; 2 Cor </p>
<p>2:12; Acts 14:27). Ephesians 6:19–20 says much the same but refers only </p>
<p>to Paul, with “me/I” instead of “us.” is is a prayer for God’s initiative, </p>
<p>assistance, and direction in opening up avenues for them to continue </p>
<p>their evangelistic task, described in 1:28 as proclaiming, admonishing, </p>
<p>and teaching all persons. Incarceration, it seems, happened to Paul as a </p>
<p>result of his missionary work, but that itself was no absolute hindrance </p>
<p>to Paul’s evangelistic activities. In fact, his imprisonment may have even </p>
<p>spurned others on in their own respective tasks (see Phil 1:12–14). Yet </p>
<p>Paul still covets their prayerful intercession for the sake of his mission. </p>
<p>Paul and his colleagues want to declare the word, and in Colossians this </p>
<p>“word” is an announcement ultimately coming from God and about the </p>
<p>Messiah (1:5, 25; 3:16). e language of proclamation clearly takes on </p>
<p>an apocalyptic character as Paul hopes to reveal the message, and the </p>
<p>same word (phaneroō) is used about the eschatological manifestation of </p>
<p>the Messiah at his parousia in 3:4. Similarly the mystery of the Messiah </p>
<p>(1:26–27; 2:2–3) relates to the curtain of the heavenly mystery being </p>
<p>drawn back to give a fuller view of a reality that, though unseen to the </p>
<p>eye, touches heaven and earth and ultimately impacts the entire course of </p>
<p>cosmic existence through the exalted Messiah. It is the secret plan of God </p>
<p>to bring salvation to the whole world in, by, and through the Lord Jesus </p>
<p>Christ. Hence, the announcement of the gospel is an apocalyptic event </p>
<p>that includes a summons to its audience for faith and obedience towards </p>
<p>the world’s true Lord (1:15–20), an oer of reconciliation (1:20, 22) and </p>
<p>forgiveness (1:14; 2:13), a warning of judgment (1:28; 3:6, 25), a declara-</p>
<p>tion of God’s triumph over evil through the cross (2:15), and a gi of hope </p>
<p>to a world that was brutal, cold, and dark (1:12–14, 23). It is no wonder </p>
<p>that Paul felt compelled to speak out of great conviction, genuine pathos, </p>
<p>and with deep concern for others (see 1 Cor 9:22; 10:33; Rom 9:1–5). </p>
<p>is compulsion came out of a belief that God’s plan to rescue the world </p>
<p>is being wrought through him, with God determining both the ends and </p>
<p>the means of his glory (see 1:29).</p>
