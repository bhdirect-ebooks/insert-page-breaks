<p> Continue on in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiv-</p>
<p>ing; </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>and praying also for us, that God may open a door for</p>
<p>us, to declare the word, the mystery of Messiah, because of </p>
<p>which I have been bound in prison, </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>so that I may reveal it</p>
<p>as I am compelled to speak. </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Walk wisely before outsiders,</p>
<p>redeeming the time. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Let your speech always be gracious,</p>
<p>seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to </p>
<p>answer everyone.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> Tychicus will make known to you all the things con-</p>
<p>cerning me; he is a beloved brother and faithful servant and </p>
<p>fellow slave in the Lord. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p> I have sent him to you for this pur-</p>
<p>pose, that you may know the things concerning us, and that </p>
<p>he might encourage your hearts. </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>With him is Onesimus, the</p>
<p>faithful and beloved brother, who is one of your own. ey </p>
<p>will make known to you everything that has transpired here. </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, and Mark the</p>
<p>cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you received instruc-</p>
<p>tions—if he comes to you, receive him), </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>and Jesus who is</p>
<p>called Justus. ese are the only men from the circumcision </p>
<p>among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they </p>
<p>have been an encouragement to me. </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Epaphras, who is</p>
<p>one of your own, a slave of Messiah Jesus, greets you, always </p>
<p>struggling for you in prayer, that you may stand mature and </p>
<p>fully assured in all of God’s will. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>For I testify to him, that</p>
<p>he has worked hard for you and for those in Laodicea and in </p>
<p>Hierapolis. </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Luke the beloved physician and Demas greet</p>
<p>you. </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Greet the brothers and sisters in Laodicea, and to</p>
<p>Nympha and the church in her house. </p>
