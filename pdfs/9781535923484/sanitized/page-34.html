<p>Introduction to Jude and 2 Peter</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Opponents</p>
<p>Over the years, the opponents in Jude have been conated with the pseudo-</p>
<p>didaskaloi (false-teachers) in 2 Peter, even though nowhere in Jude are they </p>
<p>referred to as false-teachers.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>However, a close analysis of the two letters</p>
<p>reveals signicant dierences between the opponents in Jude and the false-</p>
<p>teachers in Jude. In Jude, the opponents seem to have emanated from the </p>
<p>community and there still seems to be hope for them to be saved, while in </p>
<p>2 Peter the false teachers seem to have crossed the red line and are beyond </p>
<p>redemption.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>While in Jude the opponents are already in the community,</p>
<p>2 Peter is ambiguous in reference to the presence of false-teachers as he </p>
<p>speaks of their arrival in the future tense (2:1). </p>
<p>Identity of Jude’s opponents has ranged from “Gnoctics”</p>
<p>41</p>
<p> to “an-</p>
<p>tinomian/ libertines,”</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>besides the letter’s own reference to them as</p>
<p>“intruders”/“inltrators,” and “scoers.” e abundance of stereotyping </p>
<p>language in Jude’s rhetoric—vilifying the opponents—makes it virtually </p>
<p>impossible to make any identication based on the described characteriza-</p>
<p>tion possible.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>Recent arguments have sought to connect the opponents</p>
<p>with Jewish libertines, perhaps those reected in Acts 15 and in Paul’s let-</p>
<p>ter to the Galatians, who seem to have misunderstood Paul’s teaching on </p>
<p>freedom.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>e judiciousness of omas Schreiner to avoid any attempts at</p>
<p>identifying the opponents with any labels is a more commendable perspec-</p>
<p>tive.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>Overall, Gene Green is probably most accurate when he states that</p>
<p>the identity of the opponents “cannot be xed with any precision” and there </p>
<p>39. Kelly 1969: 231; Green 1987: 51. E.g., Bauckham (1983) constantly refers to them </p>
<p>as false-teachers.</p>
<p>40. Mason and Martin 2014: 10.</p>
<p>41. Sidebottom 1967: 75; Kelly 1969: 231, calls it “incipient Gnosticism”; See Green </p>
<p>(2008: 23–25) for arguments against Gnostic identication.</p>
<p>42. Rowston 1971: 31. Bauckham 1983: 41; Idem 1990: 166–68. </p>
<p>43. úren 1997: 451–67.</p>
<p>44. Painter 2013: 5. “Who are the opponents? I propose that the opponents are Jew-</p>
<p>ish and particularly aliated with Jewish leaders in Palestine, probably Jerusalem. His </p>
<p>characterization of the perpetrators comes based on their actions, which I will focus </p>
<p>on in a moment. Why Jewish leaders? I would rst reiterate that the letter is thoroughly </p>
<p>Jewish in its focus and uses not only the Hebrew Scriptures but at least two other Jewish </p>
<p>writings of the period, 1 Enoch and Assumption of Moses.”</p>
<p>45. Schreiner 2003: 411–16.</p>
