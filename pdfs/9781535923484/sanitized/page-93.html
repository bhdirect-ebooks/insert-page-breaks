<p>[gnosis] of Jesus are essential for faith, forming an inclusio for the entire </p>
<p>epistle—all requisite ethical requirements are the by-product of the rela-</p>
<p>tionship with God, through Jesus). </p>
<p>While the concept of gnosis (special secret knowledge) was later to be </p>
<p>developed into a very crucial element of doctrine for Christian Gnostics in </p>
<p>the second century CE, where they believed that one had to be initiated to </p>
<p>some specic neo-platonic secret knowledge in order to become a Chris-</p>
<p>tian, it does not seem to be the way 2 Peter is using the term in this letter (cf. </p>
<p>1:3, 6, 8; 2:20; 3:18).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>As Bauckham points out, a key missing ingredient of</p>
<p>Gnosticism in 2 Peter is “cosmological dualism.”</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>By epignōsis 2 Peter thus</p>
<p>emphasizes the idea of having the accurate and complete knowledge of </p>
<p>God and Jesus, and not some secret knowledge.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>at said, 2 Peter does</p>
<p>seem to emphasize knowledge (gnosis), like in this verse, where someone </p>
<p>like Paul would have preferred to focus on faith (pistis) instead.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e notion of godliness (eusebeia) which is important to 2 Peter (1:3, </p>
<p>6, 7; 3:11) is also one of the most common virtues that appears in Greco-</p>
<p>Roman epigraphs throughout Asia Minor which characterize those given </p>
<p>special honor in the associations, usually for their acts of service towards </p>
<p>deity. For example, a typical marble epigraph from Mysia (Kyzikos) honors </p>
<p>Antonia Tryphaena, daughter of king Polemon of Pontus (37/36 BCE), for </p>
<p>having shown eusebeia towards the gods, and “performing many sacrices </p>
<p>in a distinguished manner . . . with a natural love for humanity so that for-</p>
<p>eigners were amazed with favor at her piety (eusebeia), holiness (osioteti), </p>
<p>and love of glory (philodoxia)”;</p>

<p>in Sardis, a slab of blue marble found near</p>
<p>the temple of Artemis reads as follows: “e therapeutists (i.e., servants) of </p>
<p>Zeus who enter the shrine have consecrated and crowned Sokrates Pardalas </p>

<p>17. Bauckham 1983: 12. Desjardins 1987: 95, adds: “Dualism is virtually absent, and </p>
<p>the basic cosmological, eschatological and anthropological tenets of the movement do </p>
<p>not receive even a passing mention. It is, of course, debatable just how many of those </p>
<p>elements of Gnosticism—let alone of’ incipient Gnosticism”—must be present in a work </p>
<p>before it can be considered as gnostic or anti-gnostic, but surely one needs more than </p>
<p>licentiousness and psychikoi, appeals to gnosis, and allusions to visions and ‘cleverly de-</p>
<p>vised myths’.”</p>
<p>18. Picirelli 1977: 85–93.</p>
<p>19. Charles 1998: 61. “us, ‘knowledge’ in 2 Peter is stripped of any misconception </p>
<p>whereby the distinction between Christian revelation and pagan rationalism might be </p>
<p>obscured. Presupposed is a ‘knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord’ as the requisite </p>
<p>means by which ‘grace and peace might be multiplied’ (1:2).”</p>
