<p>faith and Love.</p>

<p>Greco-Roman virtue lists were also forms of stereotypes that charac-</p>
<p>terized the “idealized essentials” in a community’s construction of group </p>
<p>identity. As such, they were useful for instruction and were commonly </p>
<p>utilized as such (e.g., Seneca, Ep. 95:65–67; Herm., Mand., 5.1.1; 8.10). For </p>
<p>example, a document of club membership admission from Attica, Greece </p>
<p>(AGRW 8 = GRA 1 49 = IG II² 1369), states: “e law of the club members </p>
<p>(eranistai): It is not lawful for anyone to enter this most holy synod (syno-</p>
<p>dos) of club members without being rst examined as to whether he is pure </p>
<p>(agnos), pious (eusebeia), and good (agathos) .”</p>

<p>Most Hellenistic virtue lists begin and end with knowledge (gnosis).</p>

<p>It is therefore vital that 2 Peter, in contrast, starts the virtue list with faith </p>
<p>(pistis) and closes it with communal love (agapē). As mentioned above, the </p>
<p>foundational and distinguishing aspect of 2 Peter’s virtues from all Hellenis-</p>
<p>tic moral instruction is primarily that the relationship with God, through </p>
<p>Jesus, is what undergirds all moral stipulations. It reects what seems to be </p>
<p>a Christian pattern. In giving instruction on love to the Corinthians (1 Cor </p>
<p>13:13), for example, Paul concludes that the greatest of virtues are “faith, </p>
<p>hope, and love: and the greatest of these is love (agapē).” e three elements </p>
<p>of faith/faithfulness, hope, and love are also included in other Pauline lists </p>
<p>(Rom 5:1–5; Gal 5:5–6; 1 ess 1:3; Eph 4:2–5) suggesting their centrality </p>
<p>in early Christian ethics. Shephard of Hermas (Vis. 3.8.1.) also has a list that </p>
<p>begins with faith (pistis) and ends with love (agapē), although in his case </p>
<p>one may make a case of dependence on biblical sources. Having informed </p>
<p>us of his awareness of Pauline writings (3:15), we could also postulate a </p>
<p>Pauline inuence on 2 Peter’s structuring of the virtues to be book ended </p>
<p>by faith and love. Concluding with love is a reminder for the need for the </p>
community to bear with one another as they all strive individually and col-
<p>lectively to live up to the author’s stipulations. </p>
<p>While the whole list is on communal virtue, there is still an as-</p>
pect of arête (virtue) as a distinct element of individual morality. Arêtē

<p>as the highest virtue: “And now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; and the greatest </p>
<p>of these is love.” (NRSV).</p>
