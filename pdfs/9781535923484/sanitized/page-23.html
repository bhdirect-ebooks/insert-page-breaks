<p>Introduction to Jude and 2 Peter</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>who writes from a position of privilege, power, authority, and inuence </p>
<p>cannot claim to represent the views of the persons who, on the other side of </p>
<p>the equation, are colonized, oppressed, enslaved, powerless, and otherwise </p>
<p>subjugated. e respective points of view are colored by their respective </p>
<p>social locations, political privilege (or lack thereof), and freedom (political, </p>
<p>social, economic, etc.) that they have available. </p>
<p>is commentary series (NCCS), with its deliberate international, </p>
<p>multicultural, multiracial representation of scholars has sought to correct </p>
<p>that omission, albeit in its limited way. However small that gesture is, it is </p>
<p>a signicant recognition of the shiing composition of the community of </p>
<p>biblical scholarship from the previous dominance of Euro-American white </p>
<p>males, to one where there is an increasing signicant presence of women, </p>
<p>and of Latino/a, African-American, African, Asian, and Chinese biblical </p>
<p>scholars. Each of these groups brings dierent questions to the text that </p>
<p>previous commentaries, written largely by Euro-American white biblical </p>
<p>scholars may have completely failed to address or may have done so from a </p>
<p>biased (mostly privileged) position that did not cater to the needs of those </p>
<p>in very dierent socio-cultural-politico-economic positions. </p>
<p>In a sense, one can speak of the Euro-America readings of the Bible as </p>
<p>top-down readings (reading from positions of privilege, power, inuence, </p>
<p>etc.) versus the more recent crop of scholars from the Global South who </p>
<p>represent a more bottom-up (reading from the position of the poor, colo-</p>
<p>nized, enslaved, subjugated, etc.). Inevitably, the latter scholars also emanate </p>
<p>from regions formally colonized or otherwise occupied, by western nations </p>
<p>and are invariably shaped by that encounter. Much as the Enlightenment </p>
<p>shaped the western civilization, colonialism and slavery shaped the lives of </p>
<p>the communities over which these exercises of domination and subjugation </p>
<p>were implemented. For this reason, the tendency to apply forms of reading </p>
<p>that reect a postcolonial vantage for the latter scholars seems inevitable for </p>
<p>the non-western scholar.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another important factor is that there are constant advances in </p>
<p>knowledge that may necessitate the revisiting of issues in the Bible thus </p>
<p>justifying the need for new or updated commentaries. For example, the </p>
<p>last ten years or so have seen the development of a robust discussion in </p>
<p>historical studies about rst century Greco-Roman associations (and small </p>
<p>groups) within the Empire, which I have argued in this commentary can </p>
<p>enhance our understanding of the communities of Jude and 2 Peter within </p>
