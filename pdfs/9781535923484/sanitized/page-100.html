<p>deeds” as dened by the dierent groups and adherence to cultic practices </p>
<p>(orthopraxy), than to contemplative reection or faith (orthodoxy).</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, the terms godly and ungodly (asebeis, adikia) are very </p>
<p>narrowly dened in 2 Peter as describing those who abide by the author’s </p>
<p>teachings and those who do not, respectively. is distinction is impor-</p>
<p>tant in understanding the dierent meanings that may be appended to the </p>
<p>words by the author of 2 Peter and by the false-teachers. So it could not </p>
<p>mean the same thing for 2 Peter as it would for those whom he considers </p>
<p>false-teachers, who are otherwise characterized as ungodly or unrighteous </p>
<p>(adikia, the direct contrast of eusebēia), since for Christians the cultic ele-</p>
<p>ments were no longer part of their gatherings (e.g., Pliny Younger). at is </p>
<p>why the ultimate scenario will be that in which God saves the godly while </p>
<p>condemning the adikia/asebeis (2:5–9). </p>
<p>Similar attitude is in display in the Jewish writing called Wisdom, </p>
<p>which may indicate a tendency in Jewish oriented writers, like the author </p>
<p>of 2 Peter, in use of this terminology. Discussing Wisdom’s use of this lan-</p>
<p>guage Harland intones:</p>
<p>At the same time, personied Wisdom [Wis 12:4–5; cf. Wis </p>
<p>14:15–23] herself is an initiate of another, superior kind, an “initi-</p>
<p>ate (mustis) in the knowledge of God” (Wis 8:4). Elsewhere the </p>
<p>author critiques the “idolatry” of Greeks generally, the “impious </p>
ones” (asebũs) who do not know such “divine mysteries” (2:22)
<p>and who instead establish their own inferior “mysteries and rites” </p>
<p>(mustēria kai teletas; 14:15).</p>

<p>e group aspect in 2 Peter’s virtue list is embedded in the admonition to </p>
<p>add sibling kindness and love (philadelphia). ese can only be practiced </p>
<p>in a community and they can eectively mitigate any selsh tendencies that </p>
<p>may be promoted by the virtues listed so far. e cumulative accretion with </p>
<p>which 2 Peter structures his virtue implies that the last virtue listed carries </p>
<p>signicance that puts all others in perspective. It is what holds all the other </p>
<p>elements of the list together and makes them fully eective, since aection </p>
<p>can only be exercised and reciprocated in community. </p>
<p>In alignment with v. 2 above, v. 8 forms an inclusio where the virtues </p>
<p>listed above are encapsulated by knowledge (epignōsis). It is the saving </p>
<p>40. See Beard et al. (1998: 224–5), on eusebēia in Roman religions—practical involve-</p>
<p>ment in cultic and prayer activities of the religion rather than a contemplative aspect of </p>
<p>faith.</p>
