<p>Inltrators And eir Destiny </p>

<p>to them, may seem in line with their religious practices but to Jude are </p>
<p>deemed blasphemous. Perhaps, in their dreams, they re-enact the deling </p>
<p>acts of the angels who le their abode and consummated with humans. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, deling here is to be understood as a deed that reects loss </p>
<p>of control and the latter blaspheming, invokes a lack of spiritual prudence </p>
<p>that displays the depth of their spiritual depravity, blinded by their own </p>
<p>notion of revelation from their dreams. </p>
<p>A transition from the negative examples happens when we get to the </p>
<p>positive model drawn from the archangel Michael. In contrast to those </p>
<p>who with arrogance would dele their bodies and blaspheme angels, the </p>
<p>submissiveness of the archangel Michael is a suitable rebuke and a stark </p>
<p>contrast to their behavior. e extreme arrogance of the dreamers in their </p>
<p>blaspheming, is contrasted by the extreme humility of the otherwise pow-</p>
<p>erful archangel Michael. (In Dan 10:13; 12:1, and Rev 12:7, portrayals are </p>
<p>of a powerful archangel Michael, protector of the Israel and the leader of </p>
<p>angels into spiritual warfare.)</p>
<p>By deferring to God’s justice, Michael avoided placing himself as </p>
<p>judge over Satan, which would put him in the place of God (even though </p>
<p>he is God’s spokesperson) and resulting in blasphemy. Apparently, the </p>
<p>inltrators may be positioning themselves as judges over the community </p>
<p>consequently usurping God’s authority and thus blaspheming.</p>
<p>Once again, the backdrop for this image is 1 Enoch with its elaborate </p>
<p>discourse on angels. e exact provenance of Michael’s disputations with </p>
<p>Satan over the body of Moses is elusive since Deut 34:1–6 only describes </p>
<p>Moses’ death and burial. Proposals have pointed to the possibility that it </p>
<p>may have originated from a lost ending of the Testament of Moses. Very </p>
<p>early on in the third century CE, Origen (De Princ., 3. 2, 1), attributed </p>
<p>this text to a Jewish writing he called Assumption/Ascension of Moses (also </p>
<p>known as Apocalypse of Moses and Testament of Moses). Recent scholarship </p>
<p>has promulgated the theory that, rather than Jude simply quoting directly </p>
<p>from a single source, he has conated Jewish traditions of Michael as grave-</p>
<p>digger from Assumption of Moses, with those of Michael and accusations </p>
<p>of Azazel, in the 1 Enoch 1:9.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>As the argument goes, it points to the need</p>
<p>to acknowledge that in the only other extant reference to disputation over </p>
<p>a human body, there is no rebuking of Satan over the body of Joshua in </p>
<p>Zechariah 3:1–5.</p>
