<p>God’s Calling at Bestows Godly Nature</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>Timios (honorable) hacks back to the honor (isotimon) in the rst </p>
<p>verse. In verse one, it was the honor equally distributed to all who have </p>
<p>faith in Jesus and here it identies the imputation of such honor as to make </p>
the believers partakers of divine nature. ere is no greater honor than
<p>one where a person attains such an aliation with the deity that one could </p>
claim to embody elements of the divine. is dispensing of divine nature on the Petrine community is perhaps
<p>aimed by the author at upending, if not countering, even if in the slight-</p>
est theoretical and ideological manner, the claims to divinity made by the
<p>Roman leaders and their families. It may be also a response to the act of </p>
apotheosis (divinization) through which the Roman Senate could vote to elevate deceased leaders to semi-divine status.
<p>25</p>
<p>Even if 2 Peter’s would not</p>
have been a direct response to the claims of divinity by Caesars, it is not unrealistic that this notion of divine individuals would have loomed in the
<p>background of the claims being made here.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>at the focus, the end result,</p>
<p>is on a culmination of thorough knowledge of the person of Jesus (1:8), </p>
<p>who for 2 Peter is the Lord, another common title for Caesar, would seem </p>
<p>to support this assumption. </p>
<p>Another way to understand this relationship is by looking at it through </p>
<p>the prism of the Greco-Roman structure of Benefactor-Client relationship.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e benefactor in this case is God and the client is the Petrine community, </p>
<p>where the aliation of the latter with the former, grants the latter status, </p>
<p>authority, and honor possessed by the former and thus only available to </p>
<p>the latter because the former embodies it. By virtue of association with the </p>
<p>benefactor, the benefactors’ benets are extended to the client. In return, </p>
<p>the client oers loyalty, gis, honor, trade, good name to the benefactor. </p>
<p>It is in this regard that the client can claim to rightfully represent or </p>
<p>even embody elements of the benefactor even to the point of speaking on </p>
<p>his/her behalf. And, like many benefactor-client relationships, there were </p>
<p>intermediaries who communicated to both sides, mostly on behalf of the </p>
<p>client. is role is clearly played by Jesus, who paves the way by virtue of </p>
<p>his faithfulness, to the granting of God’s power, knowledge and glory (v. 3) </p>
<p>that transform the community towards a godly nature (theias . . . physeōs). </p>
