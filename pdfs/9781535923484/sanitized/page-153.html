<p>e Danger of Apostasy</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>ere is also a clear warning about apostasy, as verses 20–21 leave </p>
<p>no doubt about those who have escaped the world’s pollution but who </p>
<p>turn around and return to their previous lives. To those, the warning is </p>
<p>unequivocal—it will be worse for them in the end. e subject here is still </p>
<p>the false-teachers and this warning leaves little doubt that the false-teachers </p>
<p>were originally part of the Petrine community that have since broken links </p>
<p>with the group and seek to convince others in the group to do the same. </p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Apostasy versus Election</p>
<p>A mainstay and often-debated part of covenant theology is the notion of elec-</p>
<p>tion as central in the understanding of Christian salvation as the handiwork </p>
<p>of God. This notion of election (that those who were eternally destined to be </p>
<p>part the covenant community are the only ones who will eventually be saved) </p>
<p>is also often presented in defense of “once saved always saved” theology </p>
<p>that implies a guarantee of salvation. In fact, 2 Peter 2:9 can be adduced in </p>
<p>support of such a perspective given the conﬁrmation that God knows how to </p>
<p>rescue and keep safe the righteous. God is able and does save those who are </p>
<p>meant to be saved, and also retains for judgment those who have rejected the </p>
<p>grace of God. </p>
<p>As such, texts that seem to imply the possibility of apostasy (2 Pet 2: </p>
<p>20–22, Heb 6:1–12, etc.) are interpreted with the understanding that those </p>
<p>who apostatize do so because they were never meant to be part of the cov-</p>
<p>enant community in the ﬁrst place anyway. Such a view puts to question the </p>
<p>genuineness of their initial conversion to the faith so that the end result would </p>
<p>not be a genuine case of apostasy at all. </p>
<p>If all we had of the New Testament was 2 Peter, then there would be </p>
<p>no question about the possibility of true believers abandoning the faith. The </p>
<p>author of 2 Peter seems to leave no doubt about the initial conversion of the </p>
<p>false-teachers (v. 20—they came to the saving knowledge—epignosis) who </p>
<p>have now, according to his estimation, left the faith and are in danger of </p>
<p>eternal damnation. Indeed, the tragedy for him is that they did come to a </p>
<p>full understanding and acceptance of the teachings of Jesus Christ, but have </p>
<p>now been ensnared by the corruption of the world so that they have fallen </p>
<p>out of the way of truth, the path of righteousness, on which they had been. </p>
<p>Like the third group in Jesus’ parable of the sower, they had a genuine and </p>
