<p>2 Peter 2:4–6</p>

<p>relation to Sodom and Gomorrah and instead simply states that they would </p>
<p>be reduced to ashes (terrōsas), thereby focusing instead on the comprehen-</p>
siveness of the divine judgment, rather than it intensity.
<p>While Jude uses the Sodom and Gomorrah reference as part of a list </p>
of warnings on the danger of breaking divine boundaries, in 2 Peter there is
<p>no clear reason given as to why they were reduced to ashes, except for the </p>
<p>generic accusation of asebēs—ungodliness. e nature of their ungodliness </p>
<p>is not elaborated upon here, as it is in Jude 7, where it is equated to sexual </p>
<p>sin. </p>
<p>As we saw in the discussion in Jude 4, however, ungodliness (asebēs) </p>
<p>was a common accusation in Greco-Roman groups and societies when </p>
<p>identifying those they considered outsiders or potential enemies of their </p>
<p>particular group. For this reason, it makes it dicult to pin down what </p>
<p>exactly is meant by the term here in 2 Peter, and how accurate it is repre-</p>
<p>sentative of the attitudes of the perceived outsiders. What we have instead </p>
<p>is a not very helpful contrast with Lot, whose character in Genesis is nega-</p>
<p>tive, but who is here presented as the paragon of godliness. However, even </p>
<p>this comparison to Lot’s character does not necessarily clarify the nature of </p>
<p>the sin that asebes refers to here since, as we have noted above, in Second </p>
<p>Temple Judaism the story of Sodom and Gomorrah had come to represent </p>
the image of ultimate divine judgment, and that is essentially how 2 Peter
<p>uses it too. erefore, while 2 Peter eliminates Jude’s appeal to Enochic </p>
<p>material, seemingly uncomfortable with its use in this section, he seems </p>
<p>to be comfortable enough in appealing to other Jewish traditions to make </p>
<p>his point.</p>
Following the examples of divine judgment that should dispel any laxity on the part of God to exercise divine authority, 2 Peter moves on to
<p>introduce exceptions; those saved from judgment by their righteousness—</p>
<p>Noah and, peculiarly, Lot. Now, while it is understandable for Noah to be </p>
<p>labeled as righteous, since he is declared as such in Genesis (6:9b—“Noah </p>
<p>was a righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God”) </p>
<p>the same cannot be said of Lot. In the Genesis story of Lot (13, 19), it is </p>
<p>hard to justify an image of him as that of a person who could be adjudged as </p>
<p>righteous (dikaios). Yet, three times here in 2 Peter, Lot is called righteous </p>
<p>(vv. 7–8). </p>
<p>So how did Lot get to be righteous? On the one hand, it is possible that </p>
<p>2 Peter simply aligns him with Noah who in 2:5 is referred to as a preacher </p>
<p>of righteousness and thus nds the need to also show Lot to be righteous. </p>
