<p>2 Peter 1:16–21</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>is section, therefore, most likely begins the rebuttal of possible ac-</p>
<p>cusations against the author’s teachings by false-teachers, even though they </p>
<p>are yet to be directly introduced (2:1). Bauckham, pointing out the same, </p>
<p>explains that the false-teachers accuse the author and his group of preaching </p>
<p>myths (mythos).</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>In this case then the mythos would refer to the teachings</p>
<p>about Jesus that the 2 Peter 2:17–21 goes on to defend as being historically </p>
<p>grounded and having the support of eyewitnesses.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>e concept of mythos</p>
<p>was the primary category identication of stories, fables, legends, or tales </p>
<p>of Greco-Roman gods and their escapades.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>In antiquity, mythos was not</p>
<p>always laden with any negative connotation about it being a lie or untrue </p>
<p>since it was understood as the simply the stories about the gods. </p>
<p>However, besides its use here in 2 Peter, the word mythos appears only </p>
<p>in the Pastoral Epistles (1 Tim 1:4; 4:7, 2 Tim 4:4, Tit 1:14), in the rest </p>
<p>of the NT, where it is usually translated as fables and contrasted with the </p>
<p>truth. Furthermore, the participle used in 2 Peter to modify mythos and </p>
<p>translated as cleverly devised (sesiphizō) carries the connotation of “the in-</p>
<p>tent to deceive.”</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>Evidence from Hellenistic writers such as Plutarch (Mor.</p>
<p>1124C), Dio Chrysostom (Or. 54:1), Dio of Prusa (23.11; 70:10), Josephus </p>
<p>(J.W. 4.2.3 §103; Bell. 4) and Philo (Mut. Nom. 240), indicates that the term </p>
<p>could be used to disparage an opponent as a charlatan or sophisticated </p>
<p>sounding deceiver.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>e postulation is that by modifying mythos, sesophizo</p>
<p>creates the sense of mythos as anti-truth; a deceptive speech that sounds </p>
<p>almost authentic but turns out to be false (e.g., Plutarch Cam. 22.3 contrasts </p>
<p>mythos to a true account alēthei logō, and Neyrey has shown that Philo uses </p>
<p>similar language as 2 Peter to contrast mythos to logos).</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>ose who recounted Greco-Roman mythology were known to be </p>
<p>creative re-tellers who improvised in their telling of the myths to suite </p>
given societal concerns, with divine origins claimed by the archaic poet.
<p>67</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It would seem like this is the very accusation that false-teachers levied </p>

<p>ity in Greek Religion.”</p>
