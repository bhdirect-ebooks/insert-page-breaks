<p>As such, the distant future could only be best understood in terms of</p>
<p>the distant past and he argued that it would be Christianity that would infuse </p>
<p>the Akamba cosmology to accommodate the notion of a distant future. </p>
<p>Vestiges of this cosmological outlook survive even in the transformation </p>
<p>of society into a predominantly Christian community in sub-Sahara Africa. As </p>
<p>such, there is a strong emphasis on sense of the imminent return of Jesus </p>
<p>in the gospel preaching that emanates from most church pulpits, roadside </p>
<p>preaching, overnight prayer meetings, and “crusade” meetings in Africa. </p>
<p>While the biblical notion of a distant future may have taken root, the Kenyan </p>
<p>(and African) church experience reﬂects a robust African eschatological out-</p>
<p>look that retains a sense of the immediate which Mbiti observed in the African </p>
<p>cosmology. </p>
<p>Perhaps, also driven by the desperate situations of many people’s daily </p>
<p>lives, with the face of death an ever larking presence (even as I write this </p>
<p>the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone are currently </p>
<p>experiencing the worst outbreak of the deadly and incurable Ebola virus ever </p>
<p>recorded), and their struggles to survive day to day, this looking forward to the </p>
<p>parousia makes a lot of sense for them. Second Peter encourages his readers </p>
<p>not only to look forward to the parousia (2:16) but to actually will it forward </p>
<p>and make it arrive sooner, through their pious lifestyle (3:11). This message </p>
<p>then is very relevant to the African Christian community today and, in such </p>
<p>a vibrant world, it is no wonder this is the region that has the fastest growing </p>
<p>community of Christianity anywhere in the world. </p>
<p>This intense eschatological outlook may also explain the proliferation </p>
<p>of self-appointed God’s spokespersons with such titles as apostles, prophets, </p>
<p>and in some cases even messiahs, proclaiming the imminent end of the world. </p>
<p>It is also true that this plethora of self-identiﬁed God’s spokespersons whose </p>
<p>messages not only adumbrate the notion of a soon-to-be end of world, but also </p>
<p>present an understanding that the things are getting worse precisely because </p>
<p>the world is coming to an end soon. </p>
<p>While such a theological perspective may have its beneﬁts, such as </p>
<p>keeping the church alert and on it spiritual toes, it also has its signiﬁcant </p>
<p>drawbacks including the discouragement of the church from investing itself </p>
<p>fully into the present life of the community. Failure to invest in long term proj-</p>
<p>ects, especially those that cater to the needy and poor can have devastating </p>
<p>effects in the long term well being of the community. </p>
