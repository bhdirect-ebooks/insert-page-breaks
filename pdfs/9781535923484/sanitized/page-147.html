<p>Unreliability of the False-Teachers</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>e metaphors that follow are drawn directly from Jude 12, but 2 Peter </p>
<p>turns the imagery painted by the metaphors in Jude of failed promises by </p>
<p>the false-teacher, by characterizing them like overcast clouds that threaten </p>
<p>rain but never deliver. Even more than Jude’s imagery, 2 Peter makes starker </p>
<p>contrast between a spring without water (pēgai anydroi), already a contrast </p>
<p>in itself since one expects a spring to have water, and mist (omichlē) blown </p>
<p>by storm—referring not so much to a cloud but to the condensed air that </p>
<p>rises aer the rain.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>e false-teachers are like these “empty” clouds and</p>
<p>mist promising that which they are not able to deliver. In essence, theirs are </p>
<p>empty promises full of hollow words, and speeches that make loy prom-</p>
<p>ises, like the dark cloud promising rain, but failing to deliver on their word </p>
<p>(v. 18). In modern parlance, their speeches are full of hot air. </p>
<p>e second half of verse 17 presents some grammatical diculty since </p>
<p>one is unsure why the springs and mist would be referred to as being kept </p>
<p>for a gloomy darkness. Some explanation, however, could be adduced by </p>
<p>realizing that 2 Peter restructures Jude 12–13 by omitting the rest of the </p>
<p>metaphors in Jude, which resulted in an awkward structure of the sentence. </p>
<p>Building on the notion of unfullled promises, the next two verses </p>
<p>elaborate the nature of emptiness in the false-teachers’ words. Contrasted </p>
<p>to the sure/certain words of the prophets and of God (1:19–21; 2:1), these </p>
<p>false-teachers’ words are not simply unreliable, they are loy, high sound-</p>
<p>ing, and sophisticated, which appeals to the new initiates in the faith, mis-</p>
<p>leading them (v. 18). By sounding erudite and philosophical, it is easy to </p>
<p>see how this would appeal to recent converts (v. 18b) who are still learning </p>
<p>the basic tenets of the faith. And, since such ones have not been in the faith </p>
<p>long enough to have clear discernment of what is trustworthy and what is </p>
<p>not, they easily fall prey to the “impressive” and loquacious speakers. </p>
<p>According to verse 18, these speeches do not propagate truth but are </p>
<p>intended as bait (deleazō) for recent converts. e implication is that the </p>
<p>false-teachers were preaching to the new converts that they had the free-</p>
<p>dom in Christ to do whatever they wanted, probably misrepresenting Paul’s </p>
<p>teachings on what freedom in Christ means (3:15; cf. Rom 6:15; Gal 5:13). </p>
<p>at no one need alter much of their previous pagan lifestyle (stereotyped </p>
<p>as unrestrained [aselgeia] eshly desires), even though now they were </p>
<p>Christians. </p>
<p>But as 2 Peter warns, the false-teachers cannot free anyone since they </p>
<p>themselves are not free; they are themselves captives of their own eshly </p>
