<p>Inltrators as Blasphemous</p>

<p>that probably says more about the animalistic nature that they display, than </p>
<p>their actual behavior. To compare them to brutes is to denigrate and shame </p>
<p>them, to lower their status and standing in society, and to show them to be </p>
<p>lacking of the proper moral and social qualities of members of a civil soci-</p>
<p>ety. is is not unlike the Greco-Roman associations, which were generally </p>
<p>concerned with decorum, order and group rituals, while accusing outsiders </p>
<p>of corruption, drunkenness, and destruction of moral law (e.g., Livy Hist. </p>
<p>Rom. 39.8–19).</p>

<p> </p>
<p>e archangel Michael’s self-control (v. 9) is the contrast of the in-</p>
<p>ltrators’ animalistic out-of-control behavior that ultimately leads to de-</p>
<p>struction. While in verse eight blaspheming is paired with the rejection of </p>
<p>lordship (God’s or Jesus’), here it is said to be the result of the inltrator’s </p>
<p>base animal instincts—failure of discernment. Likeness to wild animals im-</p>
<p>plies that, in contrast to civil humans, they do not possess a governing sense </p>
<p>of rationality and as such are slaves to the very basic animalistic instincts </p>
<p>they reect. Plato remarks that the wild beast in humans becomes rampant </p>
<p>and out of control when overfed with meat and drink.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>is is exactly what</p>
<p>Jude accuses these inltrators of later in v. 12—feeding themselves shame-</p>
<p>lessly with out-of-control appetites! </p>
<p>In essence, since they lack the very basic self-control that distinguishes </p>
<p>humans from animals, they are classied as less than human—beasts with </p>
<p>no capacity for civility or rational behavior. While metaphorical in its func-</p>
tion, this labeling denigrates the targeted individual or group, and places
<p>them outside of the accuser’s self-perceived membership to a rational civil </p>
<p>society. Jude, by pointing to archangel Michael’s self-control in the previous </p>
<p>verse, and in the same vein as Plato, advocates moderation of appetites as </p>
<p>the way to true fulllment and happiness. e archangel Michael, in his </p>
<p>humility, becomes the perfect example for humans to emulate. In contrast, </p>
<p>the inltrators in their arrogance, lose even their human nature and have </p>
<p>regressed to basic elements of the lowest of animals.</p>
<p>e language of woe (ouai) echoes the pronouncements of future </p>
divine judgment by prophets of Israel (Isa 3:11; Nah 3:1; Amos 6:1; Hos
<p>7:13) and Jesus in the gospels (Matt 11:21; 18:7: 23), against peoples and </p>
<p>cities that had failed to heed the warning of God’s message. While woe en-</p>
<p>compasses a pronouncement of judgment, it reects more of a deep-seated </p>
<p>64. Ibid., 171: “Moreover, the association regulations or sacred laws of the Greco-</p>
<p>Roman era that have survived and been uncovered… are concerned with issues of order </p>
<p>and decorum in meetings, rituals, and banquets.”</p>
