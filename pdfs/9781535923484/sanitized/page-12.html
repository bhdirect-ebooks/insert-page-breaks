<p>Preface</p>
<p>xii</p>
<p>great commentaries on Jude and 2 Peter as those by Richard Bauckham, J. </p>
<p>D. Charles, Peter Davids, Gene Green, Michael Green, Jerome Neyrey, Bo </p>
<p>Reicke, etc., is unquestionable. anks also to R. Jackson Painter and Jer-</p>
<p>emy Hultin for sharing their SBL papers and subsequent thoughts with me.</p>
<p>I must acknowledge the support of Shaw University for their support, </p>
<p>especially the former dean of the Divinity School (currently Interim VP for </p>
<p>Institutional Advancement) Dr. Bruce Grady. Together with the generos-</p>
<p>ity of the Association of eological Schools grant (eological Scholars’ </p>
<p>Grant, 2012–13), the university approved a semester’s sabbatical in Spring </p>
<p>2013, that allowed for the bulk of the initial work in the commentary to be </p>
<p>accomplished. My family has played a very helpful role in nding time for </p>
<p>me to write, especially my in-laws who have driven six hours each way on </p>
<p>numerous occasions to babysit our two very energetic kids so that my wife </p>
<p>and I can have some free time to ourselves. To my wife Amanda, thank </p>
<p>you for your continued support. For our kids, Elijah and Rachel, may you </p>
<p>one day read this book and nd in it blessing. A close friend of mine, Rev. </p>
<p>Canon Francis Omondi, Director of the e Sheepfold Ministries, in Ke-</p>
<p>nya, read the entire manuscript in its penultimate stage and provided a lot </p>
<p>of very helpful comments that resulted in at least two more Fusing of the </p>
<p>Horizons sections. </p>
<p>When you spend a couple of years doing a writing project like this </p>
<p>one, it is bound to be impacted by important events in life. Towards the </p>
<p>end of my sabbatical, I was saddened to lose my mother, Mrs. Jane Mutave </p>
<p>Musyoka, aer what would have been a minor surgical procedure, on June </p>
<p>8, 2013. A pillar of prayer in our family lives, she is sorely missed! Travelling </p>
<p>back home for the funeral allowed me to reconnect with family and friends, </p>
<p>but also gave me evidence of my mother’s legacy of kindness, graciousness, </p>
<p>love of God and neighbor, and selessness. She was the embodiment of </p>
<p>the virtues in 2 Peter 1:5–7. If for some freaky anomaly in nature we could </p>
<p>choose a mother, I would choose her all over again! It is to her memory that </p>
<p>I wish to dedicate this book. </p>
<p>Last, and certainly not the least, I would also like to thank the series </p>
<p>editors, Michael Bird and Craig Keener, rst for the invitation to contribute </p>
<p>in the series, and also for their encouraging support along the way. I hope I </p>
<p>have lived up to your expectations for the project! And may the commen-</p>
<p>tary serve the Covenant community.</p>
