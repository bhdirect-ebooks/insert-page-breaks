<p>Refuting Accusations</p>

<p>(apothesis) appears only one other time in the NT, in 1 Pet 3:21, and is de-</p>
<p>ned as “removal, getting rid of,” and is related to tithemi (to place, put) but </p>
not to apotheosis (elevation to divine status).
<p>56</p>
<p>It is the transitory nature of</p>
<p>life that the author emphasizes rather than the Hellenistic elevation of the </p>
<p>soul over the physical body (cf. Diogn. 6:8). </p>
<p>A related imagery which he uses to describe his impending death is </p>
<p>as an exodus (exodos) (v. 14), a common description of death in Jewish </p>
<p>writings (Wis 3:2; 7:6; Sir 38:23; Jos. Ant. 4.8.2) but which more closely </p>
<p>evokes Jesus’ use of the same terminology about his own impending death </p>
<p>in Luke 9:31.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>Use of both terms by the author here seem to emphasize</p>
<p>death as a transition rather than an end, and may even be channeling the </p>
<p>Hebrew Bible book with the same name whose story is about the journey </p>
<p>of Israel is from bondage to the promised land. Death is the gateway from </p>
<p>this ephemeral life to the permanent heavenly abode.</p>
<p>Refuting Accusations: Defending Divine Origin of </p>
<p>Author’s Teachings (1:16–21)</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>For we did not follow aer cleverly devised myths while making </p>
<p>known to you of our Lord Jesus Christ’s power and appearance but </p>
had been eyewitnesses of his [divine] majesty.
<p>17</p>
<p>For he received, </p>
<p>from God the Father, honor and glory, when a voice was heard </p>
<p>which proclaimed the majestic glory, “is is my son whom I love, </p>
<p>in whom I am well pleased.” </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>is is the voice which we heard </p>
<p>coming from heaven while we were with him on the holy moun-</p>
<p>tain. </p>
<p>19</p>
<p>And we are quite certain of the prophetic word, so you will </p>
<p>do well to pay attention as to a light shining in a dark place, until </p>
<p>the break of dawn and the morning star rises into your hearts. </p>
<p>20</p>
<p>First of all, you will do well to understand this—that all pro-</p>
<p>phetic scripture did not come from the prophets’ interpretation </p>
<p>(“no prophecy came from the prophets’ personal interpretation”), </p>
<p>21</p>
<p>for no human will is able to produce prophecy, but carried by </p>
<p>the Holy Spirit, humans spoke from God. </p>
<p>ree things are highlighted in this section as evidence, and in defense, of </p>
the author’s claim to divine authority, as a follower of Jesus and teacher of
<p>the community: i) he was an eyewitness to Jesus’ transguration (v. 16), </p>
ii) he heard the divine voice conrming Jesus’ divine mandate, iii) the
