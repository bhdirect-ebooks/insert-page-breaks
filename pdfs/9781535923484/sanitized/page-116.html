<p>2 Peter 1:16–21</p>

<p>nevertheless includes the form is speech in written form, the idea of written </p>
<p>logos.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> is may thus incline us towards an understanding that the pro-</p>
<p>phetic word in 2 Peter refers to the words of the OT prophets who made </p>
<p>prophetic writings (prophetiai graphē—v. 20), in contrast to NT prophets </p>
<p>(e.g., Acts 11:27; 13:1; 15:32; 1 Cor 12:28) who are never referred to in this </p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>is leaves the stronger argument for support of the reference here to </p>
<p>be HB/OT prophets. It also makes more sense considering that this section </p>
<p>(vv. 19–21) is still connected to 1:16 as it continues the rebuttal of accusa-</p>
tions that have to do not only with the divine origin of the authority of Jesus but the divine origin of the authoritative words of the prophets who
<p>communicated the power and parousia of Jesus (v. 16). </p>
<p>Having established the origin, authority and reliability of the pro-</p>
<p>phetic word, the author then goes on to use several imageries to describe </p>
<p>the type of reception his audience should have concerning the reliability </p>
<p>of the message: pay close attention, as to i) a light shining in darkness, ii) </p>
<p>breaking of dawn, iii) morning star. All three imageries are about light </p>
<p>and darkness, and how light overcomes darkness, but also a chronological </p>
<p>outline of the soon approaching eschatological end. </p>
<p>In Jude 13, the inltrators were described as “wandering stars” that </p>
<p>deceive the people. In 2 Peter the imagery is positive and speaks of the </p>
<p>morning star rising in your hearts; the “morning star” brings light (God’s </p>
<p>presence) to the believer. Since light is the “element and sphere of the di-</p>
<p>vine,” then the reference in 2 Peter is to the essence of God engulng the </p>
<p>believer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>77</p>
It also possibly relates to the idea earlier mentioned of the divine
<p>imputation upon the believers (1:3–4).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another distinctiveness that the author wants to draw out here is </p>
<p>about the origin of prophecy, and thus its reliability and its authority—it </p>
<p>came from God and not from humans! For it to be trustworthy, it has to </p>
have ultimately had divine origin since humans cannot be the source of divine authority or power. For 2 Peter, if the words were not from God, then
<p>they were simply from the humans who spurn them (epilusis—a hapax </p>
<p>noun, not in LXX, meaning of “loose, unfurl knots, interpret”), the same </p>
<p>way a story teller spins a yarn. In this case, it would not be any dierent </p>
