<p>Nature of Inltrators as Bringers of False Hope</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>continues the caricature of the outsider as uninhibited and ungovernable. </p>
<p>eirs is a public dishonor that can only be characterized as foaming with </p>
<p>their shame. </p>
<p>ese analogies imply that the deep deception that these inltrators </p>
<p>present is not immediately visible to the community. ey are not what </p>
<p>they seem to be on the surface. Just like the hidden rocks in the previous </p>
<p>example, their impression, on the surface, is misleading. What they turn </p>
<p>out to be is mirages; giving the impression of being one thing while in real-</p>
<p>ity they are simply illusions! </p>
<p>e following images Jude uses of the inltrators, Clouds without </p>
<p>water, moved by every passing wind, implies several things—i) they fail </p>
<p>to live up to expectation, ii) they are unstable and therefore unreliable, </p>
<p>iii) they are both the converts to, and purveyors of, false teachings.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>As</p>
<p>we have noted, nowhere in Jude are the inltrators explicitly identied </p>
<p>as teachers. Nonetheless, they do not need to be teachers to spread their </p>
<p>teaching since it is in their unsuspected interactions within the community </p>
<p>that they seem to inuence their audience. e transitory nature of clouds </p>
<p>in this metaphor has also been adduced in support of the itinerant nature </p>
<p>of the inltrators. However, the emphasis is not their transient nature but </p>
<p>in their untrustworthiness. </p>
<p>Israel is usually depicted as a tree (Jer 24:1–2; Psalm 1; Micah 4:3–4.). </p>
<p>In the Gospels, for example, Israel is compared to the g tree (Mark 11:12–</p>
<p>25; Matt 21:19–25) with its fruitfulness (or lack thereof) a measure of its </p>
<p>spiritual health. In Jude, it is the inltrators who are depicted as unfruitful </p>
<p>trees. Dry/late autumn (phthinoporinos) trees with no fruit, twice dead, </p>
<p>to be uprooted rather than a reference to second death, ala Bauckham, is </p>
<p>more likely that the notion of twice dead is simply an emphatic declaration </p>
<p>of the hopelessness of the tree.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p> It is through the seed that a tree engen-</p>
<p>ders new life and keeps on producing life, and seed comes from the fruit </p>
<p>they bear. Without fruit, the tree itself is of little use since it provides no </p>
<p>sustenance (might as well be dead), nor propagates new life in the form of </p>
<p>seed—it is twice dead!</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>If by late autumn the tree does not bear fruit then</p>
<p>it has no chance of doing so as winter approaches.</p>
