<p>Refuting Accusations</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>By implication, in modifying glory (doxa), 2 Peter’s use of megalopre-</p>
<p>peia implies the undeniable grandiose and public display that character-</p>
<p>ized God’s public armation of Jesus. is public spectacle then leaves little </p>
doubt about the elevated stature of Jesus in the social structure, his divine
<p>origin and his privileged position. In terms of further refuting the mythos </p>
accusation, it could not be a myth since it was a public display of divine
<p>splendor evidenced by multiple witnesses, among whom, was the author. </p>
<p>While the primary purpose is to refute the accusation of Jesus’ story </p>
<p>as mythos, it is not dicult to envision in this declaration also a response </p>
<p>to the Caesars’ claim to be sons of God. While Caesars pronounced them-</p>
selves (or were pronounced by others—e.g., Roman Senate) to be divine (divus), Jesus’ status was announced, not by humans, but by a heavenly voice of God, in an unmistakable public display of divine majesty (Deut
<p>4:12; 1 Kgs 19:12–13; Ezek 1:28; Ezek 1:25; Jer 25:30; Joel 4:16–17; Amos </p>
1:2; Dan 4:31). e divine pronouncement gives an independent conrma-
<p>tion of Jesus’ status in public, and before witnesses, of his elevated position. </p>
<p>Second Peter wants to make it clear the Christian God actually speaks on </p>
<p>personal volition, making a public display that is an unmistakable evidenc-</p>
ing of divine authority and power. is God needs no spokespersons and is
<p>able to communicate directly without intermediaries. </p>
<p>e need to ascertain the reliability of the prophetic word (prophe-</p>
<p>tikos logos) is obviously to counter any insinuations that it is the product </p>
<p>of the author’s creative imagination—the mythos (1:16).</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>While there is no</p>
<p>clear evidence to conclusively be certain that accusation emanated from the </p>
<p>false-teachers, the possibility is rife since, aer all, they are the purveyors </p>
<p>of falsehood. It is also not clear whether the prophetic word here refers to </p>
<p>what comes before, the voice (phōnē ) that was heard (v. 18), or what comes </p>
<p>aer, the words of the prophets that had predicted the coming of the lord </p>
<p>(v. 20–21). </p>
<p>Furthermore, the voice heard on the mountain could be connected </p>
<p>to the words (logos) of the prophets, which in turn could be related to </p>
<p>the prophecy given by the Holy Spirit (v. 21). Somehow, in the author’s </p>
<p>mind, there is a relationship between these aspects of speech, and that is </p>
<p>why he has specically strung the words together this way. e only other </p>
<p>appearance of the adjective propheticos (v. 19) in the NT is in Rom 16:26 </p>
<p>where it refers to prophetic writings. In 2 Peter propheticos modies logos </p>
<p>(word). While logos is usually presumed to be reference to spoken word, it </p>
<p>74. Plato’s Dialogues serve as samples of written logoi. Cf. Sallis 1996: 18. </p>
