<p>Fusing the Horizons: Empty Eloquence versus Faithful Preaching </p>
<p>A statement probably falsely attributed to Francis of Assisi implores, “Preach </p>
<p>the gospel all the time, and when necessary used words!” This sentenced is </p>
<p>used when rebuking Christians for too much speaking of their faith without </p>
<p>accompanying it with actions in their lives. False-teachers in 2 Peter were </p>
<p>ﬂamboyant preachers whose message did not tally with their actions in life. </p>
<p>They serve as the kind of preachers that 2 Peter 2:17–19 believes are to be </p>
<p>avoided.</p>
<p>Central to the life of the Church, and the primary mode of communicat-</p>
<p>ing the gospel historically, has always been the role of preaching. The effect of </p>
<p>a good sermon is based on the persuasiveness of the message, clarity of com-</p>
<p>munication, and trustworthiness of the speaker. In the history of the church, </p>
<p>there have been renowned and eloquent preachers, but perhaps none more </p>
<p>celebrated than the Early Church father, John Chrysostom (c. 347–407 CE, </p>
<p>Archbishop of Constantinople) whose name literally means “golden mouth.” </p>
<p>While reading the autobiography of Jerena Lee (c. 1846) will also leave one </p>
<p>with no doubt about this former slave’s ability to preach and prevail in public </p>
<p>debate as she describes her call to ministry. </p>
<p>However, the tendency to be to be enamored by vibrant preaching plays </p>
<p>too central a role in determining the calling of pastors in some church denomi-</p>
<p>nations, and tends to overshadow other criteria of Christian servant leadership. </p>
<p>How good one’s preaching is also tends to be the sole criterion in inﬂuencing </p>
<p>how much of an impact a church leader has beyond his/her local church. </p>
<p>The signiﬁcance of good preaching in communicating the Gospel cannot be </p>
<p>downplayed. Nonetheless, overemphasis on the ability to preach impressive </p>
<p>sermons often peppered with effusive vocabulary, as the primary criteria of a </p>
<p>pastor’s calling, ignores the dangers highlighted in 2 Peter 2:18–19. </p>
<p>It is not only the false-teachers’ ﬂamboyant and showy style that is criti-</p>
<p>cized but the fact that it is empty, unaccompanied by any actions. It is true </p>
<p>that the criticism is not simply because it is ostentatious, but also because </p>
<p>they fail to live up to the expected virtues of a believer and in their extravagant </p>
<p>speeches they make promises they cannot keep. No wonder, their speeches </p>
<p>are credited to misleading especially the young in the faith (v. 18b). The </p>
<p>point is not that only false-teachers are eloquent preachers, but that focusing </p>
<p>primarily on eloquence invites blindness to other important factors. </p>
