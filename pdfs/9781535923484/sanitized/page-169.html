<p>Mindful of the Approaching Eschaton</p>

<p>using it to draw the contrast he has already addressed, about the “scoer’s” </p>
<p>questioning of God’s promise (3: 9). By shiing suddenly to the rst person </p>
<p>plural, we, at this point aer so far addressing his audience directly, you </p>
<p>(humas), the emphasis he makes is that he is included with those that share </p>
<p>in the faith concerning the promises of God. By identifying with the audi-</p>
<p>ence, the author makes sure that he does not come out as aloof or privileged </p>
<p>but as an equal; waiting, just like they are, on God’s promises to be fullled. </p>
<p>e concept of a new heaven and new earth derives from Isa 65:17 </p>
<p>and 66:22, and is also well developed in the book of Revelation (cf. 21:1). In </p>
<p>Isaiah, the promise is in the context of the restoration following the Baby-</p>
<p>lonian conquest and exile of the northern kingdom of Judah in 586 BCE. It </p>
<p>is promises spoken during one of the darkest hours of the people of Israel, </p>
<p>whose faith in God’s faithfulness had been shattered by their exile from the </p>
<p>Promised Land. </p>
<p>us the promise that this new heaven and new earth will be the </p>
<p>dwelling of righteousness; that is, it will be the home of righteousness, is </p>
<p>meant to remove any possibility that it will be like the rst earth and rst </p>
<p>heaven, in the terminology of Revelation. Unlike the current state of aairs, </p>
<p>where the will of God can be ignored and even rejected, in the new heaven </p>
<p>and new earth, righteousness will be the essence of existence. Just like God </p>
<p>is righteous, so will the new heaven and new earth. </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>erefore, beloved, earnestly awaiting these things, make every </p>
<p>eort to be found spotless and blameless by him in peace, and con-</p>
<p>sider the patience of our Lord as salvation; </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>just as our beloved </p>
<p>bother Paul, according to his wisdom, has written to you. </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>As </p>
<p>also in all his letters, he speaks in them concerning this—there are </p>
<p>in them things hard to understand, which those who are untaught </p>
<p>and unstable twist as also they do the rest of the writings/scripture, </p>
<p>to their own destruction. </p>
<p>Aer including himself among those looking forward to the arrival of the </p>
<p>new heaven and new earth, the author reverts to addressing his audience </p>
<p>directly about his expectations of them. He uses cultic language and im-</p>
<p>agery (spotless [aspilos] and blameless [amōmous]) to describe the state </p>
<p>they are to be found in, by the Lord (v. 14). First, one cannot miss contrast </p>
<p>the author makes to the reference of the false-teachers whom he already </p>
<p>described as spilos kai momos (spotted and blemished) in 2:13. He expects </p>
<p>his readers to exemplify the exact opposite of moral unsoundness as has </p>
<p>been shown by the false-teachers. </p>
