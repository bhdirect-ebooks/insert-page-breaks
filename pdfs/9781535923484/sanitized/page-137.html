<p>they feast with you. </p>

<p>eir eyes, full of adultery are insatiable for </p>
<p>sin. ey ensnare/trap/waylay unstable souls. ey have hearts </p>
<p>that are trained in greediness, accursed children! </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>ey are aban-</p>
<p>doning the straight path and have gone astray, following in the way </p>
<p>of Balaam son of Bosor who loved the wages of unrighteousness, </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>but was rebuked for his own transgression by a dumb donkey </p>
<p>which spoke in a human voice, stopping the prophet’s madness. </p>
<p>ere are three things that need to be highlighted in this section: i) the </p>
<p>author resorts to stereotyping to discredit the false-teachers, ii) reference </p>
<p>to meal gatherings (syneuōcheomai) allows for comparison of the section </p>
<p>with Greco-Roman associations which also had regular gatherings and may </p>
<p>shed light into the stereotyping language used here, and iii) comparison of </p>
<p>the virtue list (1:5–7) and the false-teachers’ list of ignominy supports the </p>
<p>argument that author’s stereotyping list here was carefully constructed to </p>
<p>stand in opposition to the virtue list. </p>
<p>First, while this section of 2 Peter is dependent on Jude, he realigns </p>
<p>Jude’s imageries applying them to a new context, and in the process recon-</p>
<p>structs their meaning to t his purposes. e overall focus is the fate of </p>
<p>the false-teachers; essentially, that they deserve what is coming their way! </p>
<p>e vitriolic rhetoric would be better understood in light of the Greco-</p>
<p>Roman rhetoric of intergroup conict and identity formation, especially </p>
<p>among minority groups. It draws on stereotypical caricatures of perceived </p>
<p>opponents as less than human and more like lower animals.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>Such rhetoric</p>
<p>cannot be trusted to reliably reect actual historical reality of the oppo-</p>
<p>nents, since it tends to be not only overly exaggerated, but inclines towards </p>
<p>employing the stereotypes in toto even when aspects do not directly apply </p>
<p>to specic aspects exemplied by the opponents.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>It is this metaphorical</p>
<p>nature of the stereotype which, if misunderstood, may give the impression </p>
<p>of falsication. All along there has to be clear understanding that this is </p>
<p>30. Harland 2009: 116–22, 145–60. As Harland explains, while discussing Greco-</p>
<p>Roman associations, such an approach involves: “. . . emphasiz[ing] the manner in which </p>
<p>charges of wild transgression are part of more encompassing discourses that reect the </p>
<p>methods and rhetoric of ancient ethnography in order to describe and distance the for-</p>
<p>eign “other” from one’s own cultural or ethnic group.”</p>
<p>31. Harland 2009: 174. “ese accusations, like the stories of bandit anti–associa-</p>
<p>tions, political conspiracy, and alien cults, arise from a common stockpile of stereotypes </p>
<p>of the threatening other, and there is no need to look for any basis in the reality of actual </p>
<p>practices.” </p>
