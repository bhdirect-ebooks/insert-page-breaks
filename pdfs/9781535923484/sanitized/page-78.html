<p>Jude 17–19</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>inltrators labeling them as sexually deviant (following their own lusts) </p>
<p>and rebellious (godless—asebeis) (cf. v. 16).</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, since the prediction of their appearance in this case is part of an </p>
<p>earlier prophetic utterance attributed the apostles of Jesus, it suggests the </p>
<p>saying was a well known phrase that is identied with any who t the gen-</p>
<p>eral category of mockers. eir inltration and their subsequent exposure </p>
<p>as imposters (vv. 4, 8, 10, 11, 15) brings mockery to the audiences both for </p>
<p>failing to see the deception and for failing to remember the warning of the </p>
<p>apostles. </p>
<p>is reference to the apostles of Jesus Christ, who had spoken earlier, </p>
<p>may also be used to argue for a later dating of the letter, given that it leaves </p>
<p>the impression that the apostles were long gone, and therefore the letter </p>
<p>could not be written by Jude. On the other hand, it could also mean that </p>
<p>the apostles had earlier spoken directly to Jude’s community and that Jude </p>
<p>expected them to remember what had been said directly to them. In that </p>
<p>regard, the apostles would still be alive, but since Jude was never an apostle, </p>
<p>it would make sense that he distinguishes himself from them. </p>
<p>Once again, the comparison with wild animals remains consistent </p>
<p>with the stereotyping of the enemy as being out of control. From all the </p>
<p>imagery and metaphors Jude uses to describe the inltrators, the one thing </p>
we can know with certainty is the inltrators are causing divisions (apo-
<p>diorizontes) within Jude’s community. e rest of their characterization </p>
<p>seems to fall neatly into purely stereotypical categories—brutes of nature </p>
<p>(psuchikos), scoers, having no spirit [of God]. By virtue of their lack of </p>
<p>spirit (of God), they retain their natural brutish nature. e transformation </p>
<p>that happens from having the indwelling spirit of God is missing among the </p>
<p>inltrators because the truth of the matter is that they do not have God’s </p>
<p>spirit. ey are still governed by their natural instincts and that is why their </p>
<p>behavior cannot be tempered. </p>
<p>Clearly, here the contrast between a God’s spirit-led-life versus a non-</p>
<p>spirit led life is what is meant. As such, the description of the inltrators </p>
<p>as psuchikos (brutes of nature) does little to tell us of their character since </p>
<p>it seems the case that all who do not have the spirit (of God), according to </p>
<p>Jude, are simply brutes of nature or in other words, governed by a worldly </p>
<p>mind. e simplicity of this dichotomy—if you have God’s spirit, you have </p>
<p>self control, versus if you have no spirit you have no control—is what makes </p>
<p>this comparison stereotypical. It leaves no room for the possibility that one </p>
<p>can still have the spirit of God and still struggle with self control, and that </p>
<p>99. It could also be translated, “following aer their ungodly lust.”</p>
