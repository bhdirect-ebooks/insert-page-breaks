are not afraid to foolishly challenge divine beings (v. 10). In this case, their
<p>walking aer the esh (sarx) later on also becomes the primary means </p>
<p>of enticement to new converts, waylaying them to sin (2:18). Similar vo-</p>
<p>cabulary also appears in 1 Peter 2:11 (abstain from eshly lust). Such an </p>
<p>understanding of sarx recalls Pauline use of the word as the embodiment </p>
<p>of sin (Rom 8:3; Gal 5:16, 17, 19; Eph 2:3), which stands in opposition to </p>
<p>godliness, an emphasis of 2 Peter’s. at 2 Peter acknowledges awareness </p>
<p>of Pauline writings (2 Pet 3:15) makes this connection fairly likely. Lying </p>
<p>in the background of both the Pauline and Petrine understanding is a Jew-</p>
<p>ish apocalypticism reected in the Dead Sea Scrolls that sets up a dualism </p>
<p>between the spiritual (godly) and the eshly (evil) (e.g., 1QS 11:9).</p>

<p>e rest of the negative appraisals describe characteristics of insub-</p>
<p>ordination to authority—despise lordship, arrogant, self-pleasing, not </p>
<p>afraid to blaspheme (vv. 10, 12). As explained above, the focus on order, </p>
<p>decorum and respect paint the false-teachers as anti-association and anti-</p>
<p>decorum.</p>

<p>eir behavior and attitudes collectively represent everything</p>
<p>that is not conducive to organized community life. Even the accusation of </p>
<p>blasphemy need not be simply understood theologically, but must be seen </p>
<p>in light of the characteristics describing the false-teachers as breeders of </p>
<p>defamation. While not elaborating on the nature of the blasphemy, 2 Pe-</p>
<p>ter lays out the image of a group not afraid to engage in controversy that </p>
<p>borders on the insane—even angels dare not do what they do (v. 11). ey </p>
<p>are not afraid to blaspheme; not surprising given their arrogance and their </p>
<p>extreme self indulgence, paying little or no attention to what anyone else </p>
<p>would say (v. 10). ey are their own gods, so to speak! ey display no </p>
<p>caution, something even the more powerful angels exhibit, and as such are </p>
diving headlong towards disaster—divine judgment!
