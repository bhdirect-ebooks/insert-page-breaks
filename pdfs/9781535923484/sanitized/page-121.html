<p>False-Teachers And eir Inevitable Judgment</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>purchased them bringing upon themselves sudden destruction. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>And many will follow them into unbridled living; because of </p>
<p>them the way of truth will be corrupted. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>In insatiable greed they </p>
<p>will exploit you with deceptive words. eir condemnation [an-</p>
<p>nounced] long ago, is not impotent, and their destruction is not </p>
<p>asleep. </p>
<p>is next chapter draws so heavily on the letter of Jude as to be essentially </p>
<p>synoptic in relationship, and most modern commentators agree that 2 Pe-</p>
<p>ter 2 copied from Jude in this section, rather than vice versa. However, 2 </p>
<p>Peter omits all extra-biblical material in Jude and reshapes the material to </p>
<p>t his own concerns.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Unlike Jude, who believed that the inltrators to his</p>
<p>recipient community were already present among them, 2 Peter seems to </p>
<p>be predicting the arrival of false-teachers from among them (en humin—in </p>
<p>your midst) at a future time using the future indicative verb esontai—will </p>
<p>come. </p>
<p>Later in 2:15–20, he switches to the present continuous tense even </p>
<p>though it is unclear who the subject of the sentence is because it could </p>
<p>apply equally to the false-teachers or those they have waylaid. If the false-</p>
<p>teachers, then he seems to describe them as having already arrived; indeed, </p>
<p>having come out of the same community and le the true way, even as they </p>
<p>mislead others (cf. 2 Pet 2:15). erefore, while for Jude the challenge may </p>
<p>be immediate, in 2 Peter it seems to be anticipated—there will arise false-</p>
<p>teachers—even as he conates the present with the future. </p>
<p>However, the use of the future tense here may also possibly reect a </p>
<p>subtle deliration of 2 Peter’s own claim to be a prophet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>In chapter one he</p>
<p>spent time defending the authority of the prophet as one who speaks from </p>
<p>God or on behalf of God, while including himself among those that were </p>
<p>eyewitnesses to the mysteries of God, through Jesus, by speaking in rst </p>
<p>person plural pronoun, “we” (1:15–17). He had also pointed out that what </p>
<p>was heard at the mountain of revelation was the true prophetic word, of </p>
<p>2. See Green 2008: 159–62, for a discussion. </p>
<p>3. Writing decades later than the writing of 2 Peter, the early Church apologist Justin </p>
<p>the Martyr (160 CE: Dial. 82:1) quotes 2 Pet 2:1 almost verbatim, but makes the ap-</p>
<p>pearance of a the false-teachers a present reality, of his time rather than 2 Peter’s future </p>
<p>tense: “And just as there were false prophets (pseudoprophētēs) contemporaneous with </p>
<p>your former prophets, so are now many false-teachers (pseudodidaskaloi) amongst us, </p>
<p>of whom our Lord forewarned us to beware” (ANF 1:240). In this sense, it is clear that </p>
<p>Justin understood 2 Peter’s words as prophetic for a future time, which happens to be his </p>
<p>own. For an opposing view, see Wolfgang Grünstäudl and Tobias Nickla 2014: 215–28 </p>
<p>[225–26].</p>
