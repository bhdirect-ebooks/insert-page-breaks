<p>Fusing the Horizons: Eschatology and the Gospel Message</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>Such an outlook contradicts the overall perspective that 2 Peter presents </p>
<p>about building the community and meeting its needs, especially as it en-</p>
<p>courages the building of a cohesive community structured around the virtues </p>
<p>outlined (2 Pet 1:5–7). Because of their eschatological enthusiasm, many </p>
<p>Christian communities in Africa endure similar ridicule as 2 Peter’s com-</p>
<p>munity about the delayed return of the Lord—“it has been thousands of years </p>
<p>and the world goes on the same with its violence, catastrophes, diseases, </p>
<p>and all forms of evil, yet Jesus has not returned!” 2 Peter’s encouragement </p>
<p>for the community to do good works in order to hasten the return of the Lord </p>
<p>(2 Peter 2:12–13). This should serve as motivation for the African Church to </p>
<p>plant itself in society and to seek society’s transformation through the gospel </p>
<p>message. </p>
<p>However, just like the warning of 2 Peter about false-prophets and false-</p>
<p>teachers who come proclaiming to be preaching the true gospel, but are in-</p>
<p>deed messengers of falsehood, many of these are present in Africa. They are </p>
<p>able to mislead because they sound convincing in their words. However, their </p>
<p>lives fail to exemplify the teachings they claim to represent. The community </p>
<p>has to be vigilant in turning to such a book as 2 Peter to ﬁnd guidance in </p>
<p>assessing the true teachings and the measure of true prophets.</p>
<p>The caution given is that people should be careful not to be misled by </p>
<p>hype but rather understand that God’s message, while powerful, is not to be </p>
<p>accompanied by gimmicks (2 Pet 2:16). Ultimately, there will be two kinds of </p>
<p>people who mislead—those who are outright scoffers who openly ridicule the </p>
<p>message of the Gospel, and those who, for their own selﬁsh ends, claim to rep-</p>
<p>resent the truth of the Gospel but whose lives fail to bear witness to its truth.</p>
