<p>2 Peter 1:12–15</p>

<p>prompted the understanding of 2 Peter as a testament.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>Just like God has</p>
<p>revealed the truth to the community (v. 12), Jesus also reveals to the author </p>
<p>his impending demise. e adjective tachinē implies an event that is to take </p>
<p>place, “speedily, without delay,” even though the verb used here pariemi, </p>
<p>translated as reveal or make clear, does not necessarily have the conno-</p>
tation of divine revelation in the background, as apocalypsis (revelation)
<p>would.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> Rather, it implies more of a coming to certain clarity or under-</p>
<p>standing about a particular subject matter. is awareness may therefore, </p>
<p>be driven by the author’s own personal experiences lately in his life, rather </p>
than a direct divine revelation, even though he does credit some form of
<p>revelatory conrmation from the Lord Jesus Christ (v. 14). </p>
<p>e premonition that he would soon depart this world lls the ur-</p>
<p>gency of communicating the basics of the faith to the community, even </p>
<p>though he has condence that they do know it. It is because they already </p>
<p>know that he commits to continue to remind them (lit. stir your memory), </p>
<p>as he wants them to be well grounded or secure (sterigmos), something he </p>
<p>mentions several times in the letter (1:12, 15; 3:1). Already, he had alerted </p>
<p>them to the dangers of failing to live up to the set virtues (1:9), while he </p>
<p>remains condent that they are already established. </p>
<p>So, more than a concern about any impending fall, the author is rather </p>
<p>desirous that the grounding on which the community is currently estab-</p>
<p>lished be armed, so that it would be able to resist any future upheavals </p>
<p>when he himself would no longer be there to provide the support needed. </p>
<p>While he hopes to keep reminding them, as long as he is alive, the very act </p>
<p>of writing the letter also plays the role of being a reminder, even later, as the </p>
<p>community would be able to read it over, as letters were commonly read </p>
<p>publicly, even aer the author was long gone. </p>
<p>He characterizes his envisioned demise as a putting o, or unclothing, </p>
<p>of a garment. In this regard, he compares his body to a tent (skenoma) </p>
<p>which in contrast to a permanent building is a temporary and eeting </p>
<p>structure (vv. 13, 14). e imagery created is one of this life as a “temporary </p>
<p>dwelling,” in contrast to the more permanent life in the eternal Kingdom </p>
<p>of God (1:11). </p>
<p>When the Gospel of John (1:14) talks of the incarnation it describes </p>
<p>Jesus as having temporarily dwelt (skenoō) among us, using the same root </p>
<p>word found in 2 Peter. e expression translated here as put o my tent </p>
