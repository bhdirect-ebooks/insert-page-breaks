<p>e Danger of Apostasy</p>
<p>131</p>
<p>So far, 2 Peter has used metaphors to portray the state of the false-teachers </p>
<p>and now the language becomes more direct in articulating the false-</p>
<p>teachers’ ultimate slip-up. Aer becoming believers and joining the Petrine </p>
<p>communities, they turned around and rejected the authority of Jesus and </p>
<p>instead went back to their previous state of sin. And this situation is said </p>
<p>to be worse than if they had not converted to the Christian faith in the rst </p>
<p>place. Caution has to be observed here, though, since what we have argued </p>
<p>so far is that 2 Peter’s vituperative rhetoric against the false-teachers has no </p>
<p>clear elaboration on their exact beliefs or teachings.</p>
<p>By utilizing the language of escaping the world’s pollution or dele-</p>
<p>ment (miasma) the author describes the conversion experience using cultic </p>
<p>language (Num 35:33; Jer 2:7). In similar but contrasting language, 1 Peter </p>
<p>1:4 is able to describe the anticipated heavenly inheritance as without de-</p>
<p>lement (amiantos). By implication the use of ceremonial language still </p>
<p>includes the moral turpitude which he has riled against throughout this </p>
<p>epistle. In this regard, the escape (apephygeo) that the author envisions here </p>
<p>implies eschatological danger which involves eeing from eternal damna-</p>
<p>tion (3:6–7). e world (kosmos) here then is not the physical earth but </p>
<p>rather the representation of the sinful nature or life outside of the sphere of </p>
<p>God’s saving jurisdiction, through Jesus Christ. is is the world that awaits </p>
<p>God’s judgment (3:7)! </p>
<p>e concept of knowledge (gnōsis) as stipulated here (and 1:2, 3, 8), </p>
<p>with its ability to provide escape from the pollution of the world, is most </p>
<p>likely what made earlier generations of 2 Peter interpreters to characterize </p>
<p>the false-teachers in this letter as Gnostics. For Gnostics, salvation came </p>
<p>through a secret knowledge, gnōsis, on the teachings of Jesus available only </p>
<p>to the initiates of the group who had to undergo a special initiation process </p>
<p>to gain the gnōsis. It was also an escape from the created world which, for </p>
<p>Gnostics, had entrapped the human soul (nous). </p>
<p>Doubtless, the language of 2 Peter does sound quite Gnostic and if </p>
<p>one dates the letter in the second century, there are grounds here on which </p>
<p>to possibly build a case of Gnostic inuence. However, there are still some </p>
<p>aspects that would work against such an argument. For one, if the language </p>
<p>here is drawing directly from Jude, which is a rst century document, it </p>
<p>undermines the Gnostic theory. Kelly has also pointed out that there is </p>
<p>absence here of any notion of Gnostic dualism as it would ourish in the </p>
<p>second century Gnostic teaching, and the pollutions in v. 18 are related to </p>
<p>passions and evil impulses and not inherent in the world, as the Gnostics </p>
