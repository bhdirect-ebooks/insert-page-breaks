<p>Jude 1–2</p>

<p>would be that this brother is well known and highly regarded among the </p>
<p>recipients of the letter. James, the brother of Jesus (also called the “Just”), </p>
<p>had risen to become a leading member of the early Church in Jerusalem </p>
<p>(Acts 12:17; 15:13; 21:18; Gal 2:9, 12). </p>
<p>If this is the case, it is also peculiar that Jude chooses not to identify </p>
<p>himself as the brother of Jesus but instead as a slave (doulos). However, it is </p>
<p>no more peculiar than James (1:1) who in his epistle does not call himself </p>
<p>“brother of Jesus” but uses the same exact phrase as Jude in identifying </p>
<p>himself as, “a slave of the Lord.” As Bauckham explains it, “Palestinian Jew-</p>
<p>ish-Christian circles in the early church used the title ‘brother of the Lord’ </p>
<p>not simply to identify the brothers, but as ascribing to them an authorita-</p>
<p>tive status, and therefore the brothers themselves, not wishing to claim an </p>
<p>authority based on mere blood-relationship to Jesus, avoided the term.”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is may be even more perplexing for Jude, however, if the majority of his </p>
<p>audience was Gentile. </p>
<p>For most scholars then, the traditional identity of Jude as the brother </p>
<p>of Jesus (Matt 13:15; Mark 3:21, 31, 6:3; John 7:5) remains the name’s </p>
<p>most plausible identity.</p>
<p>6</p>
Scholars, nevertheless, remain divided as to
<p>whether Jude actually wrote the letter or someone else did so in his name </p>
<p>(pseudepigaphy).</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Critics have pointed at, among other things, the erudite</p>
<p>Greek language and rhetorical skill of the letter as evidence against Jude’s </p>
<p>authorship.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>However, these and other concerns of authorship have been</p>
<p>fairly convincingly answered by Baulkham, and more recently by Green.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, then, the word slave is here used metaphorically, as a </p>
<p>description of the type of commitment that the author perceives himself </p>
<p>as having toward Jesus who is the Christ (the Greek translation of the He-</p>
<p>brew/Aramaic mešiah (translated as Messiah, meaning anointed one or </p>
<p>more accurately understood as one who is anointed by God for a special </p>
<p>mission).</p>

<p>10. e pattern of metaphorically applying the title “slave” to prophets or king may </p>
<p>have originated in the HB/OT (Exod. 32:13; Lev 25:55; 1 Sam 3:9; Ezra 9:9). is ro-</p>
<p>manticization of the reality of slavery in euphemistic language has been criticized as one </p>
<p>possibility of even the institutionalization of the Transatlantic slavery. cf. Angela Bauar, </p>
<p>“Servant/Slave,” in L.M. Russell, and J. S. Clarkson, 1996: 255–56.</p>
