<p>Introduction to Jude and 2 Peter</p>

<p>Reading the letters of Jude and 2 Peter as</p>
<p>products of similar small groups will hopefully allow us to see them in a </p>
<p>light that they have not quite been seen before. Since these letters reect </p>
<p>the writings of social groups that were part of the minority groups within </p>
<p>the Greco-Roman empire, I have sought to read them in the context of </p>
<p>Greco-Roman associations to highlight aspects they commonly share and </p>
<p>how these in turn provide a window of understanding the rhetoric of these </p>
<p>Christian letters.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Both Jude and 2 Peter mention their communities’ regular meal gath-</p>
<p>erings or “love feasts” as the prime target of the inltrators to propagate </p>
<p>their untoward teachings (Jude 12; 2 Peter 2:13). Meal gatherings were a </p>
<p>shared commonality with other Greco-Roman small groups, and played a </p>
<p>key role in the structuring of associations and so it mattered who controlled </p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>ese meal gatherings served as social institutions that functioned</p>
<p>as both social and religious assemblies with the religious entwined with </p>
<p>the communal, making the occasions without question both civic and </p>
<p>religious.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>It is in this context that one must read both Jude and 2 Peter</p>
<p>allowing for the general analysis of Greco-Roman associations to inform </p>
<p>our interpretive process of the letters.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Indeed, it is not a novel claim on</p>
<p>my part since indications are that contemporaries viewed and understood </p>
<p>early Christian gatherings in terms of associations, while some of the early </p>
<p>Christians communities also viewed themselves in such terms.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>We shall</p>
<p>examine especially the tendency in associations to use stereotyping as a </p>
<p>form of self defense against perceived enemies and also the importance </p>
<p>for associations to maintain what was considered acceptable “banquet </p>
<p>decorum.”</p>

<p>8. e term “voluntary associations” used by some scholars to distinguish between </p>
<p>Greco-Roman associations whose membership was by means of birth or civic or re-</p>
<p>ligious responsibility, in contrast to the purely voluntary groups such as trade guilds. </p>
<p>However, it is clear now that even such groups as the synagogues and some trade groups </p>
<p>obligated membership, meaning the notion of “voluntary” could not be held too strictly.</p>
<p>9. Harland 2003: 2. “From a bird’s-eye view of culture in the Roman Empire, Jewish </p>
<p>Synagogues and Christian assemblies stand together as minority cultural groups, primar-</p>
<p>ily due to their monotheism (and devotions to the same God) in a polytheistic culture” </p>
