<p>Stereotypical Characterization of False-Teachers</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>likely a reection of the author’s rhetorical construction that stereotypes </p>
<p>the false-teachers, in direct contrast to the virtue listed in 1:5–7. Similar to </p>
<p>the virtues listed, this unsavory list of false-teacher characterization also </p>
<p>has “amplication by accumulation” of the elements listed culminating, in </p>
this case, not on divine blessing but in divine judgment.

<p> </p>
<p>In this regard, it is quite unlikely that the characterizations thus pre-</p>
<p>sented reect actual behaviors by the false-teachers, and rather that it is </p>
<p>better understood in light of 2 Peter’s rhetoric with its idealized proscrip-</p>
<p>tions of both groups. Harland explains it thus: “In the process of dening </p>
<p>one’s own group, the activities of others are dened as dangerous inversions </p>
<p>of good order.”</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>is clearly becomes evident when we align side-by-side</p>
<p>the virtue list in 1:5–7 and the transgression list in 2:10–15; the latter is </p>
<p>undoubtedly an inversion of the “good order” represented in the former.</p>
