<p>is to be maintained vis-a-vis others—both God and the larger society. Vir-</p>
<p>tues thus are only meaningful in this context if what they do is to bring a </p>
<p>sense of commitment to bolstering (bebaios) the relationship established </p>
<p>between the believers and God.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e section closes with a clear articulation of the ultimate purpose </p>
<p>of all that the author is asking of the community—entry into the eternal </p>
<p>kingdom of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ. Since they are assured that </p>
<p>if they live up to the virtues listed they are guaranteed never to fall (v. 10), </p>
<p>they can rest assured that they will enter into the eternal kingdom. e </p>
<p>use of the verb ptaiō in v. 10, (cf. Rom 11:11; Jas 2:10; 3:2), meaning to </p>
<p>stumble, when used with the adjective “never” is meant to draw attention </p>
<p>to the certainty of no possibility of being in danger of falling o the path of </p>
<p>the faith. In contrast, those who fail to are in danger of not entering (v. 9). </p>
<p>e language of kyrios (Lord) and soteros (savior) (cf. also 3:1) is both </p>
a reection of the assimilation of Caesar’s claim to divine titles as well as a
<p>repudiation of the same by positing the claim of Jesus as the rightful owner </p>
<p>of the titles.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>e true Lord and savior is the one to whom the eternal</p>
<p>kingdom belongs, and not the temporal Roman Empire, and that is the </p>
<p>kingdom where those who faithfully keep to the virtues will end up too. e </p>
<p>calling and election are the means by which eternal life, via Jesus Christ, </p>
<p>can be guaranteed. e virtue list then serves as a moral guideline, not as </p>
<p>an end itself, but more signicantly, maintains eschatological implications.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Orthodoxy and Orthopraxy</p>
<p>The challenge of relating orthodoxy (what one believes) to orthopraxy (practic-</p>
<p>ing what one believes) has always been part of the struggle for the church </p>
<p>46. eissen 2001: 263: “… Christianity required a profound transformation of be-</p>
<p>havior and attitude. is was a ‘Judaism for non-Jews,’ a ‘philosophy for the uneducated.’ </p>
<p>It required neither the observance of many practical rules of conduct, as did Judaism, </p>
<p>nor did it make the intellectual claims of philosophy. But what it did do was to oblige </p>
<p>people to give fresh bearing to the whole of life. And in this way it made possible that in-</p>
<p>ward consistency of conduct which we otherwise encounter only in Judaism and certain </p>
<p>philosophical schools.”</p>
