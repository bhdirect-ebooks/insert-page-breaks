<p>Fusing the Horizons: Orthodoxy and Orthopraxy</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>from the very beginning. It is no surprise then to ﬁnd that one of the primary </p>
<p>concerns for 2 Peter in this ﬁrst chapter is relating how Christian conduct (list </p>
<p>of virtues) should be understood vis-a-vis the issue of faith in God, through </p>
<p>Jesus. At the danger of oversimplifying, I am convinced that the different </p>
<p>streams of the Church have ended up over emphasizing one over the other, </p>
<p>with some devastating results. The historical relationship of Africa with the </p>
<p>western world is complex but broad elements of comparison can be drawn </p>
<p>based on this issue.</p>
<p>Looking at the history of the western Church, central to the most signiﬁ-</p>
<p>cant turning points were issues of doctrine—what the church believed to be </p>
<p>the correct understanding of what was said in the Bible. The signiﬁcance of </p>
<p>this cannot be downplayed, even for a moment. However, it is also interesting </p>
<p>that while the western church did battle (sometimes literally) in defense of </p>
<p>doctrinal positions, one cannot avoid noticing how sometimes this excessive </p>
<p>focus on doctrine over and above, say ethics, seemed to create strange bedfel-</p>
<p>lows for the church. For example, over centuries, the focus of the western </p>
<p>church continued to be dominated by arguments over issues of baptism and </p>
<p>observance of the Eucharist while at the same time turning a blind eye on, or </p>
<p>even actively defending, systemic sins like the African slavery or colonialism. </p>
<p>In contrast, the African Church seems to have been predominantly con-</p>
<p>cerned with ethical issues more than doctrinal matters. As a result, due to the </p>
<p>lack of doctrinal foundation, the spread of questionable doctrines, inciden-</p>
<p>tally from western evangelical tradition such as prosperity gospel, have found </p>
<p>fertile breeding ground throughout the African continent devastating com-</p>
<p>munities with continued impoverishment while supporting lavish lifestyles of </p>
individuals who have made themselves the supposed conduits of God’s bless-
<p>ing. At stake is a failure to grasp the fundamental elements of what it means </p>
<p>to be a community of God, built on faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>Second Peter warns of the danger in both extremes. There has to be a </p>
<p>clear understanding that the expected character transformation in believers </p>
<p>is not an end itself, but is the by-product of the faith in God, through Jesus </p>
<p>(1:2; 8). Otherwise, the call to practice certain virtues becomes an end in </p>
<p>itself and fails to comprehend the telos (“the projected end,”) of why this </p>
<p>transformation is necessary (1:10–12). One the other hand, focusing only </p>
<p>on the understanding of doctrine and failing to incorporate it into the social </p>
<p>fabric of the community indicates a blindness and a failure in comprehension </p>
<p>of what God’s forgiveness of sin entails and inclusion into the community of </p>
<p>faith demands of its members (1:9). </p>
