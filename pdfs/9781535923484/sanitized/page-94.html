<p>2 Peter 1:3–4</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>son of Polemaios, the foremost man of the city, for following in his ances-</p>
<p>tors’ footsteps in his piety towards the deity (diakeí |menon ek progonōn </p>
<p>pros to| theĩon eusebōs) .”</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>It is in this context that we must understand 2</p>
<p>Peter’s use of eusebeia. </p>
<p>It is crucial that not just glory is attributed to God, but virtue (arête) </p>
<p>as well. While virtue (arête) occurs three times in 2 Peter [1:3, 5], it is rare </p>
<p>in the NT (Phil 4:8; 1 Pet 2:9). But the combination of glory and virtue was </p>
<p>common in Hellenistic literature and was attributed to both human and </p>
divine recipients.
<p>22</p>
<p>By appropriating it here, 2 Peter adapts it to allow for</p>
<p>glory and virtue to be accessible to the readers by means of their relation-</p>
<p>ship to God, through Jesus. </p>
<p>erefore, the next section (vv. 4–7) elaborates on the community’s </p>
<p>need to appropriate a list of virtues as a means of attaining a measure of </p>
<p>godliness that the author sees a pivotal in reclaiming the community’s en-</p>
<p>dangered relationship with God. By making it clear that all virtue rightfully </p>
<p>belongs to God, 2 Peter distinguishes itself from other Hellenistic moral </p>
<p>instructions by xing the premise of the moral character in God, and not </p>
<p>on the virtues themselves. All virtue for 2 Peter, originates and culminates </p>
<p>with God.</p>
Aer ascribing divinity to Jesus (1:1), 2 Peter extends to its followers a measure of divinity (physis) that is the outcome of association with the divine. e idea that the readers could be incorporated into divine nature
<p>has been analyzed as precept of Gnosticisim prompting the argument that </p>
<p>the false-teachers in this epistle were second century Gnostics.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>recent arguments have pointed out that with the context of the ancient con-</p>
<p>cern of the nature of relationship between gods, humans and animals, the </p>
“question raised was not about humans becoming divine but rather which
<p>characteristics and attributes these dierent classes of beings shared or did </p>
<p>not share.”</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>For this reason, there is really no need to equate its use here to</p>
<p>second-century Gnosticism. </p>

<p>24. Green 2008: 186; Bauckham 1983: 181. Jesus in John 10:24–37, is accused of </p>
<p>blasphemy for identifying as “a son of God” (apparently understood by opponents as </p>
claim to divinity) by referencing Ps 82:6 (I said, ‘You are “gods”; you are all sons of the
<p>Most High) and also asking, “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For </p>
<p>which of these are you going to stone me? In so doing, Jesus directly connects the idea of </p>
divinity with “good works.”
