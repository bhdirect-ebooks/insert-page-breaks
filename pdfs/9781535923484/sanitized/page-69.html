<p>Nature of Inltrators as Bringers of False Hope</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>are clouds without water, moved by every passing wind, dry trees </p>
<p>with no fruit, twice dead, to be uprooted. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Untamed waves of </p>
<p>the sea foaming with their shame, wandering stars for whom total </p>
<p>darkness is preserved. </p>
<p>To avoid the possibility of creating boredom with purely Jewish imagery, </p>
<p>Jude now turns to images from nature to further shame and disparage the </p>
<p>inltrators.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>Having compared them and their destiny to three HB/OT</p>
<p>characters and events, he now switches to two sets of three generic idioms </p>
<p>from nature, to further paint a picture of their depravity. First set—hidden </p>
<p>stones/without fear/shepherding themselves—and second set—waterless </p>
<p>clouds/fruitless trees/foaming waves. </p>
<p>First, Jude’s reference to the love feasts (agapais) and gatherings </p>
<p>(suneuchomai) (cf. 2 Pet 2:13) gives us the evidence that the inltrators </p>
<p>targeted the community gatherings as their main entrance point for their </p>
<p>activities.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>is reference to communal meal gatherings is central to the</p>
<p>argument that elements of this epistle can be protably analyzed alongside </p>
<p>the records of Greco-Roman banqueting in associations.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>e word agape</p>
<p>occurs frequently in the NT with the meaning of love. But its use here as </p>
<p>description of the love feast (agapais), is unique to Jude (a hapax legome-</p>
<p>non—this is the only place the word occurs in this form in the entire New </p>
<p>Testament) though a variant is found in 2 Pet 2:13. Here, it describes “a </p>
<p>common meal eaten by early Christians in connection with their worship, </p>
<p>for the purpose of fostering and expressing mutual aection and concern; </p>
<p>fellowship meal, a love-feast.”</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not only does it indicate that these were regularly planned occurrenc-</p>
<p>es for Jude’s community, as the case was for the Greco-Roman groups and </p>
<p>other early Christian groups (Acts 2:46, 20:7, 11; 1 Cor 11:20–34), it also </p>
<p>seems to indicate that is was a specic target of the inltrators, who knew </p>
<p>that they would have captive audiences on such occasions. eir message </p>
<p>70. Watson 1988:78.</p>
<p>71. Keener 1993, 2013: 722. Connections can be made to the Passover as the template </p>
<p>for the last supper and so also possibly for the love feasts. However, the Passover itself </p>
<p>was an annual feast while the Christian love feasts seemed to happen more regularly, </p>
<p>perhaps every week.</p>
<p>72. D. E. Smith 2003: 2. e social meals were not simply about eating but were social </p>
<p>institutions in the Greco Roman world of the rst century, “. . . that cut across ethnic, </p>
<p>religious, and social lines . . .”</p>
