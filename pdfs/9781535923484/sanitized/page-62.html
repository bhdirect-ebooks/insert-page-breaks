<p>that the dierent/other esh would be that of another human being and </p>
<p>may theoretically align with Jude’s later accusation that opponents behaved </p>
<p>like wild animals (v. 10). However, there is no evidence that bestiality was </p>
<p>ever read in line with Sodom and Gomorrah. is leaves us with the second </p>
<p>option as the more likely explanation for the phrase. If we are to understand </p>
<p>dierent esh in contrast to Gen 2:24, which says the couple Adam and </p>
<p>Eve, became one esh (Heb. echad basar), then perhaps Jude’s focus is best </p>
understood on the boundary breaking union of human and divine “esh.”

<p>Yet, likewise, these dreamers dele their bodies, reject lordship </p>
<p>and blaspheme [against] the glorious ones. </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>But even Michael the </p>
<p>archangel, when the devil disputed in argument concerning the </p>
<p>body of Moses, did not dare bring a judgment of blasphemy but </p>
<p>simply said, “e Lord rebuke you!” </p>
In spite of the above examples of past divine judgment which should be in
<p>their knowledge and awareness (vv. 5–7), these inltrators persist in their </p>
<p>rebellion. Once again, the depiction of the inltrators as morally out of </p>
<p>control continues the stereotyping we mentioned earlier that makes it dif-</p>
<p>cult to determine whether these are true characteristics of the inltrators </p>
<p>described here or simply a caricature that is inspired by both the typical </p>
<p>stereotyping of enemies and competing groups. Either way, these are the </p>
<p>examples that the author has chosen to utilize in driving home his point of </p>
divine judgment for disobedience. e accusations are very broad and gen-
<p>eral, with hardly any specics that can be analyzed—the inltrators dele </p>
<p>their bodies, reject authority, and blaspheme! Once again, these accusa-</p>
<p>tions follow the stereotype pattern mentioned above—sexual perversion, </p>
<p>renegade tendencies, and ungodliness (see pg.33). </p>
<p>However, Jude introduces an additional element to the characteriza-</p>
<p>tion list of the inltrators—dreamers (enupniazō). Reference to them as </p>
<p>dreamers may seem to modern readers as a simple dismissal of denigrating </p>
<p>them as disconnected from reality or being delusional.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>As Harland reports</p>
<p>on Greco-Roman society in particular, but also true of other contemporary </p>
<p>Mediterranean communities, “e gods were a regular part of the land-</p>
<p>scape of the populace’s dream life as well as waking life, and for workers of </p>
<p>53. Oecumenius was also of the same opinion (cf. Bray 2000: 251b).</p>
