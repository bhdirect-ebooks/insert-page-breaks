<p>2 Peter 3:8–10</p>
<p>144</p>
To question divine promises is to question their source, God, and to cast
<p>doubt in God’s ability to deliver is to expose ones’ utter misunderstanding </p>
<p>and dishonor of God. erefore, 2 Peter, aer showing how powerful the </p>
<p>creative word of God is (vv. 5–7) makes it clear that God has not reneged on </p>
divine promise. As such, if there are any apparent changes in the promises
<p>of God, it is not God who has changed but rather the perceptions of people </p>
<p>about those promises. God is honorable enough to keep God’s word. </p>
<p>e metaphor referenced by the author, one day is like a thousand </p>
<p>years, and one thousand years like one day, draws directly from Ps 90:4, </p>
<p>where the subject of focus is God’s eternity in contrast to eeting human </p>
<p>existence. Bauckham sees a common thread in Jewish apocalypse which 2 </p>
<p>Peter follows, where this psalm has been adduced in support of arguments </p>
<p>about the contrast between the “brevity of human life and God’s eternity.”</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ultimately, for 2 Peter, the use of the psalm quote is to encourage the ethical </p>
<p>conduct he has outlined throughout the letter, in light of the brevity of the </p>
<p>life we live. </p>
e accusations of divine delay espoused by the “scoers” have been
<p>shown to align with the attitude of the Epicureans who used it to argue </p>
against divine providence.
<p>21</p>
<p>If this is the background, then the “scoers” are</p>
<p>not only complaining about the length the period that has lapsed but are </p>
<p>essentially questioning God’s providence. at is why it is signicant that </p>
<p>2 Peter makes it clear that the delay, in fact, is part of God’s providence in </p>
<p>showing God’s mercy. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, the early church, including Paul, had expected the return </p>
<p>of the Lord within their lifetimes (1 ess 4:13–18; Rom 16).</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>In turn,</p>
<p>such an eschatological outlook produced the message that the early Chris-</p>
<p>tians preached about the soon return of the Jesus. e longer the time went </p>
<p>on and this did not happen the more agitated the community of believers </p>
<p>became and the more likely that there would arise dissenters who would </p>
<p>question this position. is would be especially true if the earliest apostles </p>
<p>would have started passing away and the lord would not have returned. </p>
<p>e author of 2 Peter then formulates what he considers a response to </p>
<p>that scenario by appealing to this notion of time—“there is no present, past </p>
<p>or future with God, and what may seem like a delay to us, is actually simply </p>
<p>God’s patience with humanity, not wishing anyone should perish.” If this is </p>

<p>22. Paul could also envision dying before the return of the Lord in Phil 1 and 2 Cor 5.</p>
