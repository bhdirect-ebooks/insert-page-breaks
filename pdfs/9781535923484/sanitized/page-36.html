<p>Introduction to Jude and 2 Peter</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Nonetheless, studies have shown that there may be plausible referenc-</p>
<p>es of 2 Peter in earlier writings such as Epistle of Barnabas (ca. 70–150),</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1 Clement (ca. 95 CE), 2 Clement (ca. 135 CE) and Shepherd of Hermas </p>
<p>(ca. 120 CE).</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>ird century Church historian Eusebius (ca. 260–340 CE)</p>
<p>says that it was by then accepted as Scripture even though he himself raises </p>
<p>concerns about its authenticity.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>Jerome (Epist. 12.11) was the rst to oer</p>
<p>the possibility that 2 Peter was written by a secretary (amanuensis) giving </p>
<p>its distinct style. eir initial rejection (or lack of mention) in the Syrian </p>
<p>Church of 2 Peter (and Jude) may have been more to do with their refer-</p>
<p>ences to angels, a subject the Syrian Church may have been eager to quell </p>
<p>since it had dominated Jewish angelology in the region.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the Reformation period (sixteenth century) there were also mis-</p>
<p>givings about the letter; Luther is said to have included it, among other </p>
<p>NT writings whose authenticity he is famously known to have questioned </p>
<p>(antilegomena), Calvin cautiously accepted it stating, “If it be received as </p>
<p>canonical, then we must allow Peter to be its author . . .”, while Erasmus </p>
<p>rejected it as a forgery.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>However, while doubts had been raised about its</p>
<p>provenance, it was not until a German scholar named Grotius in the seven-</p>
<p>teenth century dated the book to the period of the Roman Emperor Trajan </p>
<p>(98–117 CE), and altogether eliminated the possibility of it having been </p>
<p>written by Simeon Peter (the apostle who died under Nero in 64 CE, as it </p>
<p>claims in its salutation).</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over time, primary concerns raised about (and responses to) authen-</p>
<p>ticity issues in 2 Peter have included the following: </p>
<p>1. Stylistic and theological dierences with 1 Peter (Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. 3. </p>
<p>3. 1, 4; 3.25.3, 4)—At least from the time of Jerome (ca. 345–420), it </p>
<p>has been adduced that 1 Peter’s Greek is excellent and dignied while </p>
<p>that of 2 Peter is amboyant and cumbersome. Yet Peter in the Gospels </p>
<p>and Acts is presented as uneducated lowly sherman (Matt 4:18–19; </p>
<p>Acts 4:13). A common response given is that each letter could have </p>
<p>49. Picirelli 1988: 65–74.</p>
<p>50. Green 1987: 20. Bauckham 1983: 162: “ere is better evidence than is some-</p>
<p>times admitted for the fact that 2 Peter existed in the second century.” </p>
<p>51. Eusebius, Hist. Eccl.: 3.3.1–4; 25.3; 6. 25 .11: “Peter has le behind one acknowl-</p>
<p>edged epistle, and perhaps a second; for it is questioned.”</p>
