<p>Fusing the Horizons: Preaching From Jude</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>reader but the case has been made that it would have been better understood </p>
<p>by both Jude’s audience and opponents as an acceptable rhetorical device in </p>
<p>public encounters, involving contested group identity. Also, besides the acer-</p>
<p>bic rhetoric, the letter itself is devoid of much of the doctrinal teachings found </p>
<p>in other NT books. As a result, not much preaching usually comes from this </p>
<p>little but important part of the NT epistles. It is no wonder then that probably </p>
<p>the most commonly known passage from Jude is the often used benediction:</p>
<p>Now, for the one able to guard you without stumbling, and cause </p>
<p>you to stand before the face of judgment itself without blemish, in </p>
<p>extreme gladness, the only God our savior, through Jesus Christ our </p>
<p>Lord, glory, majesty, dominion, and all authority for all time, now and </p>
<p>forever more, amen. </p>
<p>Though used often, it is also very likely that many who are familiar with this </p>
<p>benediction do not even know that it is from Jude. </p>
<p>However, before declaring Jude’s language untenable for the Church it </p>
<p>behooves us to take a look at the rhetoric that accompanies other NT writings </p>
<p>in comparison to Jude’s. For example, compare Jude’s caustic speech with </p>
<p>Paul’s in 1 Cor 5, where he condemns the member of the church who has </p>
<p>married his father’s wife to be cast out for a while that the devil might work </p>
<p>on him. Other NT writers occasionally employ the polemical rhetoric of op-</p>
<p>ponent name-calling. Jesus, for example, calls Gentiles “dogs” when the Syro-</p>
<p>Phoenician woman seeks him out on behalf of her daughter—“It is not fair to </p>
<p>take the children’s food and throw it to the dogs” (Matt 15:26; Mark 7:27). </p>
<p>Paul also calls his opponents dogs (Phil 3:2) and so does Rev 22:14, while </p>
<p>2 Pet 2:22 employs sayings that equate opponents to dogs and pigs. Listen </p>
<p>to the reprimand that Jesus (Matt 12:34; 23:33) and John the Baptist (Matt </p>
<p>3:7; Luke 3:7) gave to the Pharisees when they called them “brood of vipers.” </p>
<p>The vitriol seems to approximate that of Jude yet these writings are not </p>
<p>ostracized for that reason. In fact, one may see some similarities of the reme-</p>
<p>dial intention between Paul and Jude. Later, in 2 Cor 2:5–11, Paul decides </p>
<p>enough punishment has been meted against the man who married his fa-</p>
<p>ther’s wife, and recommends that the person be brought back into the church. </p>
<p>Similarly, while Jude is very harsh against opponents, he does come around </p>
<p>and encourage the community to reach out to those wavering to save them as </p>
<p>if from ﬁre (22–23), even though it is doubtful that this group includes the </p>
<p>inﬁltrators. </p>
