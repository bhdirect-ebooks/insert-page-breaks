<p>Contending for the Inherited Faith, Against Inltrators</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>Jude then informs his audience of his compulsion to write to them in or-</p>
<p>der to encourage them to stand up for the faith in light of the perceived </p>
<p>danger of inltrators. e phrase he uses, contending for the faith, need </p>
<p>not be understood simply as attacking the inltrators (even though Jude </p>
<p>does denounce them), but vv. 5–19 must be understood in light of vv. 3–4 </p>
<p>and vv. 20–23. Ultimately, the readers must overcome through faith (pistis) </p>
<p>and resistance, the inltrators’ message.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>eir condemnation is already</p>
pronounced (vv. 17–18), and will be a denite divine act.
<p>Even aer assuring the community of the shared faith, Jude notes </p>
<p>that the faith they are contending for is one received from the holy saints </p>
<p>(hagiois pistei). e question then becomes, i) is faith here a reference to a </p>
<p>body of teachings or the acts of exercising belief? If the former then this </p>
<p>may imply a later period of Jude’s provenance, in the post-apostolic era; ii) </p>
<p>does saints here mean the Jewish community as the chosen chasidim? Or </p>
<p>does he mean his own audience and all people associated with the Judeo-</p>
<p>Christian faith? If the former, then this would seem to conict with his </p>
<p>desire to make the largely Gentile audience, feel like part of the inheritors </p>
<p>of the faith. By declaring, that this faith was given once and for all, means </p>
<p>it would not be given again, at least not in the manner that it was rst given. </p>
<p>As such, Jude’s community can only come by it through their relationship </p>
<p>with those who rst received it. If the latter, then it means that while the </p>
<p>reference may be to Jewish saints of old, it also includes his readers who </p>
<p>have inherited this faith and now are recipients of God’s salvation.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>e language of struggle (epaginitzō) used here was also commonly </p>
<p>used in reference to athletes and their endurance and determination when </p>
<p>competing in a race—“pep talks” to get them red up for the competition.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e call then is one that recognizes that the exercising of faith, called upon </p>
<p>here, is one where they have to “stand up” for the faith and literally defend </p>
<p>it. Like soldiers in battle defending their territory, the audience is urged, in </p>
<p>essence, to exert itself in a deliberate eort to defend the faith, fully aware </p>
<p>that actual dangers are entailed in this process. </p>
<p>Besides the fact that the audience may not share a common Jewish </p>
<p>heritage with the author, the compulsion to write to them originates from </p>

<p>21. Note in 1 Peter 2: 9–10, the largely Gentile audience is directly identied with </p>
<p>terms previously reserved for the Jewish community—chosen people, holy nation, royal </p>
<p>priesthood, etc. Bauckham 1983: 33; Mbuvi, 2007:1–45.</p>
