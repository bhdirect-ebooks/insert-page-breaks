<p>Warning About Scoers</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>counter position to that presented by the inltrators. is sets up a sce-</p>
<p>nario where the contrast is between they (inltrators—houtoi) and you </p>
<p>(audience—humeis)</p>
<p>A – they are to be judged, </p>
<p>B but you are to be saved; </p>
<p>A’ – they are liars </p>
<p>B’ but you must speak the truth; </p>
<p>A”– they are devoid of the spirit of God, </p>
<p>B” – but you pray in the holy spirit; </p>
<p>A”’– they are complainers, arrogant and sexually deviant, </p>
<p>B”’ – but you show mercy, save those falling away, seek eternal life, </p>
<p>through God’s mercy. </p>
<p>Such emphatic bifurcation between the beloved and the damned inltra-</p>
<p>tors is driven by the author’s conviction that these are the last days. e in-</p>
<p>ltrators represent those whom the apostles of Jesus had predicted would </p>
<p>appear in the last days. ese are the scoers/mockers (empaiktēs), who </p>
<p>dishonor others with the intent of shaming by making a public ridicule of </p>
<p>those they deceive.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>e meaning drawn from its cognate (empaizo) is “to</p>
<p>trick someone so as to make a fool of the person” and implies a premedi-</p>
<p>tated malicious intent.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is is precisely what Jude accuses the inltrators of doing when he </p>
<p>accuses them of deception; deliberately waylaying the community, fully </p>
<p>aware that they are deceiving it (v. 4).</p>
<p>98</p>
<p> By ridiculing the apostolic teach-</p>
<p>ings, the scoers undermine the veracity of their message forcing the com-</p>
<p>munity to doubt. Jude wants to bring it to the open that this very tactic had </p>
<p>been foretold as a warning that prophesied the eventual arrival of these, </p>
<p>otherwise unreliable scoers.</p>
<p>However, the term scoer (mockers) still remains a generic classica-</p>
<p>tion of general opponents’ overall portrayal rather than a description of </p>
<p>specic action. is is supported by the stereotypes that follow the refer-</p>
<p>ence to the sayings of the apostles, which have been used earlier against the </p>
