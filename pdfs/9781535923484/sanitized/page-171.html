<p>of the false-teachers/“scoers.” Nonetheless, it has been pointed out that </p>
<p>the events described in the letter should be cause for upheaval in the com-</p>
<p>munity and so understanding peace as a virtue that the community should </p>
<p>strive for, would make sense here.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e reference to writings by Paul here (3:15), which seems to imply </p>
<p>that there are by this point in time possibly a collection that circulates </p>
<p>among the community, and also by virtue of the author’s comparison of </p>
<p>these writings to scripture makes the case for a late authorship. It has also </p>
<p>been pointed out that Paul and Peter did not get along very well (Gal 1–2), </p>
<p>and that it would be unlikely that Peter would refer so positively to Paul’s </p>
<p>letters. is last argument is weak since people do change and relationships </p>
<p>do grow. As for the previous argument, the writings of Paul are still referred </p>
<p>to as letters (epistolē), and so it is unclear which one or how many they </p>
<p>would have been. It is possible that the false-teachers had misunderstood </p>
<p>and misinterpreted Paul’s teaching of freedom in the faith (Rom 3:8; 6:15; </p>
<p>Gal 5:1, 13) and had allowed themselves to break the limits of conduct that </p>
<p>are expected of Christian believers.</p>

<p>It is these that the author describes as amathēs astēriktos which BDAG </p>
<p>translates as incompetent interpreters (lit. untaught and unstable) who </p>
<p>have failed to understand Paul’s teaching.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>Paul had denitely taught about</p>
<p>the return of the Lord in 1 essalonians, and this letter seems to be fa-</p>
<p>miliar to the author as he makes reference to its teachings (3:10). Need-</p>
<p>less to say, Paul’s own teachings are themselves declared to be dicult to </p>
<p>understand (dysnoētos) and apparently only the well taught or trained can </p>
<p>interpret them accurately. </p>
<p>e false-teachers then are portrayed as simpleton wannabe teachers </p>
<p>who have misconstrued Pauline teachings which they should have sought </p>
<p>help with, and instead they have gone ahead to declare themselves teachers </p>
<p>even though what they teach is full of error. Worse still, it is not just the </p>
<p>teachings of Paul that they misconstrue but other Scripture as well, mean-</p>
<p>ing the obvious danger is judgment or as the author puts it, apōleia (de-</p>
<p>struction). is projected outcome would imply that the author believes </p>
<p>that for the false-teacher, it is a deliberate twisting (strebloō) rather than the </p>
<p>result of a genuine attempt to correctly understand Paul’s teachings.</p>
