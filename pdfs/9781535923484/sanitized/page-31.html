<p>Introduction to Jude and 2 Peter</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>For these defenders of authenticity, the process of elimination is used </p>
<p>in order to arrive at one of at least eight people named Jude (Judah, Judas) </p>
<p>in the NT as the author. e name Jude was fairly common given its origin </p>
<p>with one of the patriarchs of Israel, “Judah,” and is one of the most com-</p>
<p>mon names in the NT, besides the reference to “Judas Iscariot.”</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>e early</p>
<p>church seemed to assume that the Jude in the epistle, who identies himself </p>
<p>as the brother of James, is one of the disciples (“Jude son of James” listed in </p>
<p>Luke 6:15; John 14:22; Acts 1:13) or a brother of Jesus listed in the Gospels </p>
<p>with other Jesus’ siblings (Matt 13:55; Mark 6:3). A third identication was </p>
<p>with the apostle addeus (Matt 10:3; Mark 3:18), while a fourth identied </p>
<p>Jude with disciple omas (whose name means twin) who some of the Syr-</p>
<p>ian church traditions identied as a “twin” of Jesus (Acts of omas11; 31; </p>
<p>39; Book of omas 138. 4, 7, 19). </p>
<p>While there are others called Jude in the NT (Judah father of Simeon </p>
<p>Luke 3:30; Judas the Galilean Acts 5:37; Judas of Damascus in Acts 9:11; Ju-</p>
<p>das Barsabbas Acts 15:22–32) none of them is identied as having a brother </p>
<p>called James. As for the disciple in Luke 6:15, he is called a “son of James” </p>
<p>and not brother, making him and others mentioned above as unlikely </p>
<p>candidates of identication with the letter’s author. e only person in the </p>
<p>Gospels who has a sibling called James is Jude the brother of Jesus (Matt </p>
<p>13:55; Mark 6:3). e James mentioned here can also be identied with </p>
<p>the one mentioned in Acts (12:17; 15:13) who is also called “the brother of </p>
<p>the Lord” in Galatians (2:9-12). Mention by Paul (1 Cor 9:5) of “the Lord’s </p>
<p>brothers” as traveling missionaries strengthens the idea that the Lord’s </p>
<p>brothers (James and Jude) were well known in the early Church.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Early acceptance of the letter by the Church was followed by chal-</p>
<p>lenges, primarily for its use of 1 Enoch and other biblical writings.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>Western church accepted it early, but the Syrian church hesitated (e.g., </p>
<p>exclusion in the fourth Syrian Peshitta manuscript together with 2 Peter, 2 </p>
<p>and 3 John, and Revelation) for a while to include it in its canon. But it is </p>
<p>probably Jude’s reference to the non-canonical writing of 1 Enoch in Jude </p>
<p>14–15, that made it suspect in the early period, rather than questions of the </p>
<p>author’s authenticity.</p>

<p>While accepting Jude as authentic, Origen (second</p>

<p>patriarch (Matt 1:2–3; 2:6; Luke 3:33–34; Heb 7:14; 8:8; Rev 5:5; 7:5) or the land of Judah </p>
