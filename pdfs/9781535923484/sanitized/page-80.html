<p>Jude 20–21</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>between bruteness of the former (v. 19) and the civility of the addressees is </p>
<p>premised upon the absence and presence of the spirit of God, respectively. </p>
is equation of civility with divine connection, in contrast to the
<p>wild animal-like nature of those who do not have the spirit, is also premised </p>
<p>on the stereotyping that allows the in-group to distinguish the out-group as </p>
<p>barbaric, ungodly and out of control.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>In contrast, the in-group perceives</p>
<p>itself as those with control over their faculties, emotions and desires, the </p>
<p>direct opposition to the wild ungodly outsiders (psychikos).</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>It is therefore</p>
<p>unlikely that such statements would be an accurate measure of the inltra-</p>
<p>tor’s actual sense of godliness, since the language used is stalk caricature of </p>
<p>perceived outsiders.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e notion of mercy as it relates to anticipation has an eschatologi-</p>
<p>cal outlook as it focuses on eternal life (zoē aiōnos).</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>In v. 1, aer Jude</p>
<p>identies his audience as those that are kept (tēreō) safe in Jesus Christ, he </p>
<p>wishes them the mercy of God. Usually, when the verb tēreō occurs in the </p>
<p>NT in connection with God, it is with God as the agent (i.e., God as the one </p>
<p>keeping).</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>Mercy, was added to the greeting in v. 1 to make Jude’s use of</p>
<p>the generic epistolary salutation more distinct. But it also may emphasize </p>
<p>the eschatological nature of his overall message. Here, in v. 21, mercy ap-</p>
<p>pears once again with eschatological connection to eternal life. While the </p>
<p>two are very likely connected, it has also been suggested that the occurrence </p>
<p>of mercy here may be more closely derived from 1 Enoch 1:8.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>Either way,</p>
<p>the three elements of mercy, keeping, and eternal life are juxtaposed in a </p>
<p>symbiotic relationship. In light of these previous uses of tēreō, it is a pecu-</p>
<p>liar command here in Jude given that the believers are the ones expected </p>
<p>to actively participate in keeping themselves in God’s love, contra Jude 1. </p>

<p>102. Ibid. “ese accusations like the bandit anti-associations, political conspiracy, </p>
<p>and alien cults, arise from a common stockpile of stereotypes of the threatening other, </p>
<p>and there is no need to look for any basis in the reality of actual practices.”</p>
<p>103. Webb 1996: 141.</p>
<p>104. BDAG 814–15: Tēreō is usually used in NT with an eschatological inclination </p>
<p>(e.g., 1 ess 5:23; 1 Pet 1:4; 2 Pet 2: 4, 9, 17; 3: 7; John 17: 11–12)</p>
<p>105. Webb 1996: 141, n. 7: “Jude’s use of eleos in v. 21 to allude to Christ’s parousia </p>
<p>may be inuenced by the Greek text of 1 Enoch 1:8 in particular, for it describes escha-</p>
<p>tological salvation as ‘mercy shall come upon them’ (ep outous genesetai eleos). Jude has </p>
<p>already cited the succeeding verse (1 Enoch 1: 9) in vv. 14–15 as a reference to Christ </p>
<p>bringing judgment at the parousia.”</p>
