<p>Introduction to Jude and 2 Peter</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>seems to be the role played by the list of virtues laid out in 2 Peter (1:5–7), </p>
<p>and exhortations for proper conduct in Jude (3, 20–24) which provide the </p>
<p>foundation for the social structure of their communities. Granted, how-</p>
<p>ever, that the communities of Jude and 2 Peter do remain distinct in some </p>
<p>ways from their Greco-Roman counterparts, they still mirror them in their </p>
<p>striving to t neatly in the larger society’s expectations and concerns about </p>
<p>religious group structures and behavioral patterns.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> By indicting the oppo-</p>
<p>nents as anti-banqueters and anti-moralists, Jude and 2 Peter seek to con-</p>
<p>versely portray their own communities as models of association life within </p>
<p>the Roman Empire, even as they seek to distinguish them as structured </p>
<p>around the Lordship of Jesus Christ and not Caesar.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, while locating Jude and 2 Peter in their rst-century setting, I do </p>
<p>also hope that in my analysis of these two small but important New Testa-</p>
<p>ment writings, my own readings tempered by my sensitivities to matters </p>
<p>hermeneutical, postcolonial, liberationist, and African will further con-</p>
<p>tribute to the conversation on how best to interpret these writings in our </p>
<p>day and age, while paying close attention to the rst century Greco-Roman </p>
<p>context of their origin.</p>
<p>Jude</p>
<p>Authorship</p>
<p>Today there are essentially two primary positions on the question of Jude’s </p>
<p>authorship: advocates for an early authorship usually arguing for Jude the </p>
<p>brother of Jesus (“a servant of Jesus and the brother of James”),</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>and in</p>
<p>contrast, advocates for a pseudepigraphical authorship (later author writ-</p>
<p>ing in the name of Jude).</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>e latter position rejects the authenticity of</p>
<p>the letter’s own claim in Jude 1. ese two positions are equally balanced </p>
<p>and both have committed defenders within the guild. Arguments made by </p>
<p>Bauckham over twenty years ago, remain at the heart of the defense for the </p>
<p>authenticity position.</p>
