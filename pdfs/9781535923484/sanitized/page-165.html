<p>Meaning of Delayed Parousia?</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>God’s perspective, then it may seem to contradict the author’s perspective </p>
<p>about the fate of the false-teachers whom he is convinced are already be-</p>
<p>ing chained with certainty of judgment anticipated (2:1–3). How can the </p>
<p>destruction of the ungodly be so certain (3:7), while God is so patient and </p>
<p>longsuering (makrothymia)? </p>
<p>One may wonder, aer all the castigation of the false-teachers in chap-</p>
<p>ter two, and the “scoers” (3:1–2), and the sure judgment awaiting them, </p>
<p>whether 2 Peter here considers the possibility that all (panta) are able to </p>
<p>repent. He has already made it clear that the ungodly would face destruc-</p>
<p>tion (apōleias) in v. 7; he now announces that God desires no one to face </p>
<p>destruction (apōleias). </p>
<p>He seems to open up the door for the possibility of anyone to repent. </p>
<p>However, given what we have mentioned about the change of focus in his </p>
<p>address toward his audience, these words are directed specically towards </p>
<p>his audience and not the “scoers.” e “scoers’” end is certain judgment. </p>
<p>ey thus may not be part of this collective all referred to here. Further, in </p>
<p>support of this reasoning is the use of the word boulomai (to wish)—God </p>
<p>does not wish any to perish. It is God’s desire or wish that none perish, </p>
<p>however, this does not stop people from rejecting God’s truth for falsehood </p>
and bringing divine judgment upon themselves.
<p>As mentioned earlier, verse 10 may be directly dependent on 1 ess </p>
<p>5:2—For you yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord will </p>
<p>come like a thief in the night, and harks back to the words of Jesus in the </p>
<p>little apocalypse (Matt 24:43–44; Luke 12:39–40), and is also referenced in </p>
<p>Rev 3:3, 16:15. Paul is exhorting the essalonians to remain vigilant in </p>
<p>their faith as they look forward to the soon arrival of the day of the Lord by </p>
<p>laying out ethical instruction utilizing body armor imagery. He implores </p>
<p>them to remain sober as they await the arrival of the Lord. </p>
<p>Second Peter proceeds to describe this day as one wherein destruction </p>
<p>of the created world as we know it would happen. Aer mentioning the </p>
<p>destruction of the ungodly (v. 7) he now elaborates on the heavens passing </p>
<p>away (parechomai) in a loud voice (rhoizēdon) and the dissolving of ele-</p>
<p>ments in intense heat (kausoumai). e day of the Lord will be sudden, and </p>
<p>composed of loud noise and of intense heat. is continues the re image in </p>
<p>verse 7. is destruction of the heavens and the earth anticipates the arrival </p>
<p>of new heaven and earth in verse 13. </p>
