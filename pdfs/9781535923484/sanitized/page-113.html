<p>Refuting Accusations</p>
<p>93</p>
against the Petrine community’s claims of divine heritage through Jesus
<p>Christ, and which the author of 2 Peter then sets out to rebut. In contrast </p>
<p>to deceptive mythos, the author claims that the historical reliability of the </p>
story of the divine nature of Jesus and its proclamation by his apostles, is based upon eye witnesses evidence. So the recounting of the divine origin
<p>of the Christian message is grounded on historical evidence—the reliable </p>
word of eyewitnesses of [Jesus’ divine] majesty.
<p>Its trustworthiness then, is premised on this defensible historical wit-</p>
ness. By defending the reliability of the teachings about Jesus’ divine man-date and subsequent role of his divinely inspired messengers, the author
<p>of 2 Peter draws attention to, and fends o, the accusations levied by the </p>
<p>false-teachers. </p>
<p>What exactly is the form of majesty presumed here? In the Greco-</p>
<p>Roman society, honor and glory were ascribed as public recognition of </p>
<p>one’s service to the gods, society, family or courageous display of gallantry </p>
<p>in warfare or other public service. Honor was bestowed publicly on those </p>
<p>who were deemed honorable and usually transmitted by an already honor-</p>
<p>able person or group to the recipient(s). Honor then was one of the highest </p>
<p>virtues sought aer in the Greco-Roman society, and in most Mediterra-</p>
<p>nean societies. </p>
<p>e honor (timē) and glory (doxa) ascribed to Jesus is said to origi-</p>
<p>nate from God, who is called father (pater) whose heavenly voice (phōnē) </p>
<p>(vv. 17, 18) was heard publicly ascribing power, honor, and glory to Jesus </p>
<p>by eyewitnesses at the special event on the holy mountain (hagio orei). It </p>
<p>evokes the installation of the king of Israel, which according to Ps 2:6–7, </p>
<p>takes place on God’s holy mountain, Zion.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>In the NT, reference to the</p>
<p>holy mountain not only identies the event with the transguration (Matt </p>
<p>17:1–9; Mark 9:1–9; Luke 9:28–37) it also builds on the tradition of the </p>
mountain as a place of divine revelation (Exod 3:5–6) arming that the voice is divine and that the majestic glory (megaloprepeia doxa) bestowed
<p>on Jesus is from God. e transguration then must be the event referenced </p>
as the divine majesty witnessed by the followers of Jesus among whom the
<p>author of 2 Peter claims to have been.</p>
<p>e title Father (pater) anticipates the identication of Jesus as the </p>
<p>royal son (v. 18) while also identifying God as the benefactor who bestows </p>
<p>honor and glory upon the son, and through the son to the community </p>
