<p>Reminder to Readers to Be Vigilant</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>e connection here is borne of the almost identical phrase in 1:3 (by </p>
<p>way of reminder) which introduces the virtue list. And so, while the refer-</p>
<p>ence to the reminder of words spoken earlier by holy prophets is drawing </p>
<p>from Jude 17, it also clearly harks back to 2 Pet 1:3 giving it a dierent </p>
<p>context. </p>
<p>We have already shown that the similar reference to prophets in 1:16–</p>
<p>21 and 2:1–3 could be to OT prophets and this remains true of this refer-</p>
<p>ence too. In this instance, however, the author combines the words of OT </p>
<p>prophets with the apostles’ presentation of the commandments (entolē) of </p>
<p>the lord and savior [Jesus Christ]. Once again, the author adduces the two </p>
<p>authoritative sources—prophets and apostles—earlier appealed to in de-</p>
<p>fense of the teachings of the parousia (the Lord’s eschatological appearance) </p>
<p>that had been questioned by the false-teachers (1:16–21). </p>
<p>e prophets’ message is described as spoken words (rhemata) while </p>
<p>that of the apostles in called commands (entolē) of Jesus (also referred to </p>
<p>in 2:21).</p>

<p>One wonders if there is any signicance in the author’s choice of</p>
<p>vocabulary here: Rhema vs Logos? Both Plato (Crat. 425a) and Aristotle </p>
<p>(Poet. 1456b 15) classify logos (usually translated as word or speech) as </p>
being able to be distinguished as either true or false, and divisible between
<p>noun (onoma) and verb (rhema) and may represent a body of teachings.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rhema on the other hand is to be understood as an action word, literally </p>
<p>“a thing said,” whose use here may suggest, just like its appearance in 1 Pet </p>
<p>1:25, the never changing nature of God’s plans and purposes. </p>
<p>However, in 2 Peter, the distinction is not maintained since in 1:16, </p>
<p>he refers to the “logos of the prophets,” which in essence is parallel to the </p>
<p>“rhema of the holy prophets,” used here. In contrast, the false-teachers are </p>
<p>said to espouse false logos (2:3), which has to be contrasted with the logos<span class="ff2"> <span class="_ _3" /><span class="ff3 ls10 ws23">of </span></span></p>
<p>God (3:5–7) through which the heavens and the earth were formed (3:5), </p>
<p>and are now being sustained awaiting the nal judgment (3:7). </p>
<p>When dianoia (clear minds/pure thinking—its only other occur-</p>
<p>rence in the NT being Phil 1:10) appears in 1 Peter 1:13, it is also in the </p>
<p>context of the author reminding the audience about the role of the proph-</p>
<p>ets in communicating the message of the salvation (1 Pet 1:10–13), as it </p>
<p>is here. In the former case, the instructions are to make the mind active </p>
<p>in preparation for the coming salvation by reacquainting it with the past </p>
<p>7. In 1 Peter 1:25: the rhema of the Lord abides forever, alluding to the never chang-</p>
<p>ing nature of God’s purpose for creation. </p>
