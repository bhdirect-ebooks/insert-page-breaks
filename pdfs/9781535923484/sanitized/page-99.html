<p>NT virtue lists in Acts and Galatians, and may indicate a central element in </p>
<p>the moral structure of the Pauline and Petrine communities. </p>
<p>Furthermore, it is also one of the four Platonic cardinal virtues (others </p>
<p>being “justice, fortitude, and prudence”) indicating a sense by which 2 Pe-</p>
<p>ter adapts to, or has internalized, some of the common philosophical moral </p>
<p>principles of the day, to which he appends his own convictions concerning </p>
connection to divine and human/familial love. In comparison, Musonius
<p>Rufus, a 1 CE Stoic philosopher, in commentating on why women should </p>
<p>be allowed to study philosophy in Frag. 3, follows the four cardinal virtues </p>
<p>in his diatribe, and elaborates on self-control: “. . . to control her temper, </p>
<p>not to be overcome by grief, and to be superior to uncontrolled emotion </p>
<p>of every kind. Now these are the things which the teachings of philosophy </p>
<p>transmit, and the person who has learned them and practices them would </p>
<p>seem to me to have become a well-ordered and seemly character, whether </p>
<p>man or woman.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p>A common element in pagan virtue that is missing in 2 Peter’s list is </p>
<p>philanthropos (humane) which seems to be replaced by longsuering (hy-</p>
<p>pomone), a common Christian virtue (2 Cor 6:6; Gal 5:22; Eph 4:2) which </p>
<p>is linked to self-control.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>It seems signicant that philanthropos is omitted</p>
<p>given that it was the epitome of arête (excellence) in Greek thought. How-</p>
<p>ever, one could argue that hypomone does encompass an aspect of philan-</p>
<p>thropos ever slightly shiing the characterization that 2 Peter is developing, </p>
from the focus on the individual to that of the group. Another possibility
<p>would be to point the role of philadelphia at the end of 2 Peter’s list as the </p>
<p>equivalent of philanthropos, which also in turn shis the focus from the </p>
individual to the group. Ultimately, in Petrine writing, hypomone charac-
<p>terizes not only the writer’s perceived group’s virtue, but it also becomes a </p>
divine attribute (God is described as longsuering—1 Pet 3:20; 2 Pet 3:9,
<p>15) providing the direct link of the community to God. </p>
<p>Aware that there is temptation for longsuering to be turned into an </p>
<p>element of pride, 2 Peter admonishes that it has to be linked with eusebēia </p>
<p>(piety, godliness). Eusebēia is one of the most commonly noted attribu-</p>
<p>tions of special honor in the Greco-Roman associations.</p>

<p>man religion, it was understood more in terms of performance of “religious </p>
