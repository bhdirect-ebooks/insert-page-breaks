<p>Jude 3–4</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>Similarly, the issue of religious freedom is at the root of the concerns </p>
<p>in the letter of Jude. However, the origin and nature of the inltrators’ </p>
<p>beliefs are not presented with any clarity, as they are in the letter to the </p>
<p>Galatians. roughout Jude’s letter, the inltrators are characterized as ase-</p>
<p>beia—ungodly or impious (vv. 4, 15, 18; cf. 2 Pet 2:5), sexual p<span class="_ _1" />er<span class="_ _1" />verts (vv. </p>
<p>4, 8, 10), blasphemous (vv. 8–10; cf. 2 Pet 2:2) and antinomian (vv. 4, 10; </p>
<p>cf. 2 Pet 3:17).</p>
<p>Accusations of sexual promiscuity and unusual sexual practices were </p>
<p>common in ethnographic descriptions of outsiders in rst-century Greco-</p>
<p>Roman group polemics.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>So, when Jude proceeds to construct the image of</p>
<p>the inltrators, he does so not by giving actual descriptions of the perceived </p>
<p>enemies, but by falling back on a weapon of warfare—propaganda rhetoric! </p>
<p>Just like in the case of warfare scenarios where the next step would be to </p>
<p>identify and uproot the enemy, Jude follows this with the Greco-Roman </p>
<p>stereotypes that caricature enemies as sexual perverts, ungodly, and bar-</p>
<p>barians.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>us, it is likely the case that what may be happening in Jude is</p>
<p>a case of competing groups each seeking to have the upper hand theologi-</p>
<p>cally within the community. </p>
<p>Ungodliness (asebeia) is here, in v. 4, paired with sexual perversion </p>
<p>(aselgeia) that the inltrators are accused of exchanging for God’s grace </p>
<p>(charis). Ungodliness’ immediate contrast to aselgaia (sensuality, licen-</p>
<p>tiousness) has tended to be understood as depicting a more specic notion </p>
<p>of Christian freedom that the inltrators abuse with their wanton sexual </p>
<p>activity. Grace, a common Christian term for salvation through Jesus </p>
<p>Christ (Rom 3:24; Eph 2:8; 2 ess 2:16; Heb 12:15; James 4:6; 1 Pet 1:2, </p>
<p>10: 2 Pet 1:2, 3:18; 2 John 3; Rev 1:4) most probably encompasses the same </p>
meaning here. e opponents are despising divine authority and ultimately
<p>rejecting salvation. </p>
<p>However, while this is a plausible reading, the combination of ungod-</p>
<p>liness and sexual perversion, evident in other parts of the epistle (vv. 8, </p>
<p>16, 18, 23), may reect more of a stereotyping accusation than substantia-</p>
<p>tion of actual behavior among the inltrators.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>A similar pattern is seen</p>
<p>in v. 8, the notion of the opponents as dreamers, a possible allusion to </p>
dreams as means of divine guidance is also juxtaposed with an accusation
<p>27. For example, Tacitus c. 115, accused Judeans’ of supposed “unlawful” sexual be-</p>
<p>havior (Hist. 5.5.2); Cf. also Martial Epigr. 7. 30; Justin, 1 Apol. 7.3, 46.3, 60.11; T<span class="_ _3" />atian, <span class="ff4 ls5f ws9d">O<span class="_ _1" />r.<span class="_ _5" /></span><span class="ws0"> </span></p>
