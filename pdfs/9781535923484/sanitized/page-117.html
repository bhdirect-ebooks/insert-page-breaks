<p>Refuting Accusations</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>from the accusation of mythos that had been propounded by the oppo-</p>
<p>nents. Such mythos is not attributed to gods or spirits, but it is assumed to </p>
<p>be the product of deliberate human will (thelema) to deceive, evident in </p>
<p>the false-teachers. </p>
<p>e contrast then is between God-inspired activity versus and human-</p>
<p>derived thoughts and actions, and the model of distinguishing between the </p>
divinely ordained and that which is of human emanation nds parallel in
<p>Greco-Roman religious distinction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>78</p>
<p>As the rst-century Roman empire</p>
<p>grappled with cohesion and identity in its rapid geographical expansion, </p>
<p>with a growing number of religious groups within it, it came to classify all </p>
<p>religious activity as either religio—worship of the Greco-Roman pantheon </p>
<p>(the true gods), or superstitio—worship of “false” gods.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p> is binary is in-</p>
<p>tended to make clear delineations of practices that were deemed acceptable, </p>
<p>versus those classied as dangerous to the stability of the empire.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>Since</p>
<p>religio involved giving traditional honors (specically, prayer and sacrice) </p>
<p>to the gods, it is no surprise that Christianity was classied as superstitio </p>
<p>by Pliny the Younger in his correspondence with Emperor Trajan, and was </p>
<p>assessed as needing close supervision from the authorities.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is structure also seems to be reected in this section of 2 Peter </p>
<p>(though in reverse) where the aspects of true religio are premised on the </p>
<p>alignment with the “true” prophetic message from God, in contrast to the </p>
<p>superstitio of the false-teachers who do not honor God but satisfy their </p>
<p>selsh desires—a false piety. As subjects of the Roman Empire it is not </p>
<p>surprising that Christians would incorporate the Greco-Roman religious </p>
<p>categories in their religious discourse. </p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Eschatology and the Gospel Message</p>
<p>Four decades ago, in his groundbreaking study on the New Testament and </p>
<p>African eschatology, the renowned African theologian Prof. John Mbiti re-</p>
<p>marked that in the Akamba (Kenyan) traditional cosmology, with no clear </p>
<p>conception of an end of the world, there existed no distant future, and the </p>
<p>immediacy of the near future predominates any conceptualization of future </p>
