<p>2 Peter 2:12–16</p>

<p>the teachings espoused by the author. at is why it is in their corruption </p>
<p>(phthora) they will be destroyed (phthora)—they bring upon themselves </p>
this divine judgment, the wages (misthos) of their unrighteousness or
<p>fraud. When they do suer injustice (adikoumenoi) it is not because they </p>
<p>are innocent victims of an unjust system, but instead they are receiving </p>
<p>that which they have brought upon themselves. is reference to deserved </p>
<p>wages (misthos) anticipates the example of Balaam in vv. 15–16, who had </p>
<p>loved wages (misthos) of fraud. </p>
<p>It is dicult to envision the next accusation levied here in v. 13 as </p>
<p>literal in any way—nding [sensual] pleasure (hedonen—only in Luke </p>
<p>8:14; Tit 3:3; Jas 4:1, 3) in daylight reveling (tryphēn). Is this actually a </p>
<p>description of something that was taking place? If this were the case, then </p>
<p>the likelihood would be that the author would be upset with his audience </p>
<p>for tolerating it, just like Paul was with the Corinthians (1 Cor 5) for not </p>
<p>dealing with the sinner in their midst. If what they do is so repugnant and </p>
<p>so open, it is unclear why the community has not seen this as a signicant </p>
<p>concern. Surely the community can tell when inappropriate acts are tak-</p>
<p>ing place in their midst, unless they themselves tolerate it, and even get </p>
<p>involved in it. However, the impression the author gives is that only the </p>
<p>false-teachers are involved in these behaviors, even in the presence of those </p>
<p>he is writing to, and whom he presumes do not get involved. </p>
<p>More likely than not, these accusations reect a hyperbolic rhetoric </p>
<p>aimed at amplifying the egregious nature of the false-teacher’s ethics. Per-</p>
<p>haps the vivid image painted here is best explained in light of stereotyping </p>
<p>language rather than a malevolent desire by 2 Peter for physical violence </p>
<p>against the false-teachers. If the collective use of stereotypes that 2 Peter </p>
<p>uses is intended to completely discredit his opponents, then the intention </p>
<p>is not to represent actual behavioral reports. Rather, it involves the use of </p>
<p>metaphoric language, irony and hyperbole to enunciate the threat such op-</p>
<p>ponents represent to the community.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>is is the use of rhetoric which,</p>
<p>while it overstates the case, is deliberately intended to shock the reader to </p>
<p>the serious danger they may be in by following the false-teachers, even </p>
<p>though what may be shocking language to us today may have been familiar </p>
<p>public jousting platitudes to the ancients’ ears. </p>
<p>41. Harland 2009: 174: “ese . . . arise from a common stockpile of stereotypes of </p>
<p>the threatening other, and there is no need to look for any basis in the reality of actual </p>
<p>practices.”</p>
