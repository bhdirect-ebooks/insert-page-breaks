<p>2 Peter 1:5–11</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, 2 Peter’s concern is with the moral transforma-</p>
<p>tion of the community, as vv. 5–7 indicate. is would suggest that the form </p>
<p>of godliness he has in mind is very closely connected to the community’s </p>
<p>appropriating of the ethical aspects, which can be rightly described as </p>
<p>godly, because it is God who empowers them through Jesus, to be able to </p>
<p>conform to the virtues listed.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>is is the godly power that they need in</p>
<p>order to escape the world’s corruption and its evil desires. </p>
<p>Virtues That Govern The Godly Life (1:5–11)</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>And for this same reason also, mastering every eort </p>
<p>to bring alongside your faith, virtue/excellence, and</p>
<p>to virtue add knowledge, </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>and </p>
<p>to knowledge, self-control, and </p>
<p>to self control, longsuering/endurance, and </p>
<p>to longsuering, godliness </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>and </p>
<p>to godliness, sibling kindness and </p>
<p>to sibling kindness, love.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>For these things will abound and increase for you, keeping you </p>
<p>from being inactive and unfruitful, and bringing you into the </p>
<p>knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>For in whomever these </p>
<p>things are lacking, he/she is so shortsighted as to be blind, forget-</p>
<p>ful of the purication received of past sins. </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>erefore, brothers </p>
<p>and sisters, be all the more eager to ascertain your calling and </p>
<p>election. For by doing this, you will never stumble. </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>For this will </p>
<p>draw you closer to the way into the eternal kingdom of our Lord </p>
<p>and savior Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>Similar virtue lists as the one found in this section of 2 Peter are identiable </p>
<p>in other NT writings and have been identied in Greco-Roman writings.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, unlike the Greco-Roman writings or even the other NT cata-</p>
<p>logues (Gal 5:19–23; Col 3:12–14; Phil 3:6–9, 4:8–9; Eph 4:1–6; Jas 3:13–18; </p>
<p>Titus 3:1–7; 1 Tim 1:9–10, 6:3–5; 2 Tim 3:2–5), 2 Peter’s list of virtues sets </p>
up a complete and incremental relationship of the individual elements with
<p>each successive virtue deriving from and building upon the previous one. </p>
