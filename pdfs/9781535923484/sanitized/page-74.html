<p>e fruitless tree thus also evokes comparison with the g tree that </p>
<p>was cursed by Jesus aer he found it to be fruitless (Mark 11:12–14, 20–25). </p>
<p>Fruitlessness, then is an indication of spiritual deadness deserving judg-</p>
<p>ment, and contrasts to the notion of fruitfulness (Matt 3:8; Luke 3:8) that </p>
<p>exemplies abundance of the Spirit of God, which is also described as bear-</p>
<p>ing fruit. </p>
<p>Finally, the image of wandering stars probably harks back to 1 Enoch, </p>
<p>which the author references directly in the next verse (v. 14) and which </p>
<p>he has already referenced earlier in v. 6. Allusions could also be made to </p>
<p>1 Enoch 18:14–16; 21:6; 86:1–3; 90:24.</p>

<p>Unlike stationary stars like the</p>
<p>North Star, which could be relied upon for direction in the night, these </p>
<p>mobile heavenly bodies are of no use to the traveler. ey are useless, in </p>
<p>the least, and dangerous since they would denitely misdirect the traveler </p>
<p>using them for guidance. ese are phony and unreliable guides, not to be </p>
<p>trusted at all.</p>
<p>Fate of the Infiltrators as Predicted by Enoch (vv. 14–16)</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>And also, Enoch, the seventh from the Adam, prophesied against </p>
<p>these ones saying, “Behold the Lord comes with his holy tens of </p>
<p>thousands, </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>making judgment against all things and convicting </p>
<p>all hearts on account of all their ungodly works of, those who act </p>
<p>impiously and, concerning all the harsh/violent, who speak along </p>
<p>with those ungodly sinners. </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>ese are complainers who quarrel, </p>
<p>are driven by their lustful desires and their mouths speak pomp-</p>
<p>ous words, raising their countenance on account of prot. </p>
<p>Drawing further textual support for his condemnation of the inltrators, </p>
<p>Jude turns his attention once more to the writing of 1 Enoch to bolster his </p>
<p>evidence for their impending judgment. In Gen 5:21, Enoch is listed as </p>
<p>seventh from Adam and is also, referenced as such in 1 Enoch 60:8. Unlike </p>
<p>the other HB/OT examples adduced by the author as warnings to the in-</p>
<p>ltrators and their followers, Enoch is appealed upon as a voice that spoke </p>
<p>warnings on behalf of God. Others were examples of what not to do or say, </p>
<p>but Enoch is one who correctly uttered the warnings of God. (Yes, archan-</p>
<p>gel Michael was also cited as an example to emulate but he is an angel, not </p>
<p>human.) Enoch is the exemplar, who positively stands out in contrast to all </p>
