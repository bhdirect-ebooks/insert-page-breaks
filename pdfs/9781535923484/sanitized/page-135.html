<p>Guarantee of Divine Judgment in the Present</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>related to the Day of Judgment, as many scholars seem to prefer?</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>Either</p>
way, the certainty of divine judgment is unquestionable.
<p>e reference to “those” may be generic in completing the thought of </p>
<p>the last verse—“those who will be judged”—but it also includes specically </p>
<p>the false-teachers whom the rest of the section refers to in third person plu-</p>
<p>ral pronoun. “ey” are contrasted to angels (v. 11), likened to wild beasts </p>
<p>(v. 12), described as sexually perverse (v. 13a), portrayed as detractors at </p>
<p>social gatherings (v. 13b), with “eyes full of adultery” (v. 14), and an insatia-</p>
<p>ble desire for sin (v. 14b). While plausible, it is dicult for one to envision </p>
<p>how these are actual descriptions of characteristics of the false-teachers. </p>
<p>Instead, as we have seen so far and throughout the rest of this chapter, the </p>
<p>collective descriptions and accusations of the false-teachers seems to reect </p>
<p>stereotyping language of people who are anti-banquet, and anti-association </p>
<p>(see Introduction).</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>If the point of the 2 Peter is to portray his adversaries as enemies of </p>
<p>order, discipline, restrain, and therefore unworthy of membership to his </p>
<p>group, this is in line with the way Greco-Roman associations portrayed </p>
competing or adversarial groups or individuals.
<p>27</p>
<p>With such stereotypical</p>
<p>portrayal, it is dicult to determine the accuracy of the specic accusations </p>
<p>drawn against of the false-teachers with any certainty, let alone reconstruct-</p>
<p>ing their teachings and beliefs.</p>
<p>In this regard, these accusations are being made by the Christian </p>
<p>writer against a rival self-identifying Christian group, with a dierence in </p>
<p>doctrinal teachings and dierence in understanding of religious freedom. </p>
<p>is may indicate the great desire by the writer’s in-group to portray them-</p>
<p>selves in good light as upright members of the larger society—i.e., “we are </p>
<p>not like these barbarians but we are a well mannered and responsible group </p>
<p>that is being corrupted by a few bad apples; ones who are giving us a bad </p>
<p>name. Our banquets are civilized aairs that conform to the decorum of </p>
<p>banquets and associations. We conform to the expectations of empire and </p>
<p>the larger society.” In not too distant a future, a reversal would occur where </p>
<p>it is the Christians who would be accused of the same oenses by their non-</p>
<p>Christians neighbors (cf. Pliny the Younger’s Letter to Trajan and Didache). </p>
<p>Once again, the notion of sexual perversion is included in a list of </p>
<p>accusations against those who blaspheme (i.e., the false-teachers), and who </p>
