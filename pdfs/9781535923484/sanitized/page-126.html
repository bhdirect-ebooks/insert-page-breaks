<p>deception on their part. Similarly, in 2:15 they are also described as having </p>
<p>adulterous eyes, that are “insatiable (akatapaustos) for sin.” e insatiabil-</p>
<p>ity is clearly a vice in direct contrast with the virtue of self-control (hu-</p>
<p>pomone—cf. 2 Pet 1:6), and continues the stereotype of the anti-banquet, </p>
<p>those who are not t to be members of the Petrine community. It describes </p>
<p>voracious appetite that overpowers any inclination of virtue that may be </p>
<p>present in the false-teachers. </p>
<p>Driven by this insatiability, they turn to deceit to get their way. For </p>
<p>2 Peter, their deceptive words (plastios logos) clearly contrast with pro-</p>
<p>phetic word (prophetikos logos—v. 19 and prophetic writings (prophet<span class="_ _0" />ikos </p>
<p>graphē—v. 21) which bear witness to the true knowledge (gnosis) that </p>
<p>saves, through Jesus Christ. While the phrase plastios logos is a hapax lego-</p>
<p>menon (it appears only this once in the entire NT), the expression is found </p>
<p>in other rst century writers such as Josephus where it refers to forgeries.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We could therefore understand reference to deceptive words to be more </p>
<p>than just a form of speech but may refer to a body of teachings that the </p>
<p>false-teachers have. Just as the false-prophets misled with their deceptive </p>
<p>prophecies, so too would the false-teachers ensnare with their treacherous </p>
<p>teachings. </p>
<p>Such an understanding may also suggest that these teachings by </p>
<p>false-teachers may bear close resemblance to the teachings of the author, </p>
<p>but turn out to have fundamental dierences whose singular purpose is </p>
<p>of intentionally misleading, and whose consequences for, both teachers </p>
<p>and adherents, are utterly dire.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>What the false-teachers speak is not truth</p>
<p>(aletheias—in contrast to v. 2, above), and it does not bring salvation, but </p>
<p>rather is falsehood masquerading as the truth and can only ultimately lead </p>
<p>to eternal damnation. </p>
<p>e author does not mince words when it comes to judgment of the </p>
<p>false-teachers and their followers (2 Peter 2:3b)—their long pronounced </p>
<p>condemnation is nigh. eir condemnation [announced] long ago, is not </p>
<p>idle, and their destruction is not asleep. What awaits them is judgment </p>
<p>(krima) and destruction (apoleia), which are neither impotent [lit. “idle”] </p>
<p>(argei) nor asleep (nustazō). It would seem that this is a rebuttal of a claim </p>
<p>by the false-teachers that God’s judgment will never happen since such a </p>
long time has elapsed and promised divine punishment has not befallen
