<p>2 Peter 3:3–4</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>message of prophets, while here, the emphasis is on Eilikrinē (lit. judged in </p>
<p>sunlight) which describes the type of clarity or spotlessness that is visible </p>
<p>in the bright sunlight. </p>
<p>e author expects that there would be no doubt in the audience </p>
<p>about the words they received, just like a potter would be certain about the </p>
<p>lack of cracks in a vase by holding it up against the sunlight. e purpose is </p>
<p>to give a sense of condence about what the audience already knows to be </p>
<p>true and reliable given their source—the “lord and savior” via the apostles. </p>
<p>Lastly, the reference to the commands of our Lord and Savior, once </p>
<p>again, is a politically charged denunciation of a claim to the community’s </p>
<p>lordship by the Roman emperors (see commentary on 1:11, above). In some </p>
<p>respects, what would be later reected in Pliny the Younger’s concession to </p>
<p>dealing with interrogation of Christians, seemed to boil down to whether </p>
<p>the accused worshipped the emperor as lord and savior or Jesus. </p>

<p>Judgment? (3:3–4)</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Above all, know this, that there will come in the last days sco-</p>
<p>ers, with scong, who while indulging their own lusts </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>will ask, </p>
<p>“Where is the promise of his coming? For, ever since the fathers </p>
<p>fell asleep, all things continue as they have from beginning of </p>
<p>creation.” </p>
<p>e phrase “above all, know this” raises the signicance of what the author </p>
<p>is about to say. Having conrmed the purpose of his writing to them as the </p>
<p>need to remind them (2:1–2), he now points out that they need to know </p>
<p>(ginōskō) what these last days (eschatōn ton hēmerōn), are going to produce. </p>
<p>Consistent with his use of Jude, this passage is drawn from Jude 18 but the </p>
<p>author of 2 Peter makes changes, replacing Jude’s unusual phrase eschatou </p>
<p>tou chronou (at the end of time). Ginoskō here carries the same weight that </p>
<p>it does when used to describe the kind of saving knowledge that the readers </p>
<p>ought to have (1:2; 2:20). It is knowledge with not a shade of doubt. </p>
<p>Having just remarked about listening to the words of the prophets, he </p>
<p>now speaks as a prophet about the expected arrival of mocking scoers, </p>
<p>recognizing their arrival as an indicator that these are the end times. is </p>
