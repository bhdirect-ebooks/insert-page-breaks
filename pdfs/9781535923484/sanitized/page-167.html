<p>Fusing the Horizons: e Coming of the Day of the Lord!</p>

<p>but by their godly conduct in life (3:12) which has already been laid out for </p>
them in the list of virtues in 1:5–7. So, while we may not control the divine
<p>timetable, we may be able to inﬂuence it particularly if we conduct our lives </p>
<p>in accordance with the godliness that is pleasing to God. In essence, what </p>
<p>may be otherwise perceived as a fairly ordinary human action, godly conduct, </p>
<p>turns out to have quite the extraordinary eschatological implications. And that </p>
<p>is why the encouragement from the author to the readers is to make “every </p>
<p>effort” (3:14) to live godly lives.</p>
<p>Mindful of the Approaching Eschaton, Maintain Holy </p>
<p>Conduct (3:11–16)</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Given that all things will be dissolved, what kind of lives ought </p>
<p>you to live? In holy conduct and godliness, </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>awaiting expec-</p>
<p>tantly and hastening the coming of the Day of the Lord, because </p>
<p>of which, by re, the heavens will be dissolved and the elements </p>
<p>will be consumed by melting heat. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>And in accordance with the </p>
<p>promise, we earnestly await a new heaven and a new earth, where </p>
<p>righteousness is to dwell. </p>
<p>e question the author poses in verse 11 is crucial in pointing the reader </p>
<p>to the primary reason for writing this epistle. Aer going through all the </p>
<p>challenges that his audience is facing, he then steps back to outline the an-</p>
<p>astrophe (conduct) that are to be evident in the new eschatological outlook </p>
<p>of the parousia. Eschatology, for the author, lays the groundwork for the </p>
<p>ethics he formulates for the community.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Aer explaining the kind of destruction awaiting the entire creation </p>
<p>in the day of the Lord, the author now turns to the implications of such an </p>
<p>understanding for the social reality of the community. Returning to the </p>
<p>focus on ethics with which he commenced his letter (1 Pet 1:3–7), the au-</p>
<p>thor proceeds to lay down ethical expectations in light of the eschatological </p>
<p>outlook he has formulated. </p>
<p>Essentially, the epistle has come full circle. is period of waiting must </p>
<p>be characterized by constraint rather than the false-teachers’ abandon and </p>
<p>lack of self-control. Recalling what he had stated in the previous statement </p>
