<p>2 Peter 3:8–10</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>Moreover, everything in earth will be judged, including that which is </p>
<p>hidden, since all its works will be exposed (euriskō). Nothing will escape </p>
<p>this judgment since, even elements (stoicheia)—the fabric of all created </p>
<p>things—will melt in this heat.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Whatever it is that the “scoers” doubted</p>
<p>about the day of the Lord, its certainty is made sure here, and its compre-</p>
<p>hensiveness established. ere will be no escaping.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: The Coming of the Day of the Lord!</p>
<p>Over the years we have been exposed to the spectacle of one or another </p>
<p>“Christian group”—driven by some misguided eschatological understanding </p>
<p>and led by some domineering leader—trying to predict the end of the world as </p>
<p>we know it. Without fail, they all are proved wrong when nothing happens and </p>
<p>the world continues as it has been over millennia. And in most instances, like </p>
<p>the tragic suicides led by Jim Jones in the 70s, the inferno in Waco, TX in the </p>
<p>80s where David Koresh and Branch Davidians perished, or the Movement for </p>
<p>the Restoration of the Ten Commandment in Uganda in 2000 in both a fairy </p>
<p>inferno and poisoning, they end up in tragic deaths. </p>
<p>If the statement of Jesus in Mark 13:32 (Matt 24:36) and in Acts 1:7; </p>
<p>about the inability of humans (even Jesus) to determine when the end would </p>
<p>come had not been conveyed to the Petrine community, 2 Peter’s paradoxical </p>
<p>statement about God’s conception of time makes the same point about the </p>
futility of humans trying to decipher divine timetables. Implicit in this human
<p>desire to know is the need for control. And so the second metaphor of the </p>
<p>unexpected arrival of the thief (v. 10), also borrowed from the Gospels (Matt </p>
<p>24:43; Luke 12:39) by 2 Peter, makes it rather clear that the most important </p>
<p>thing is to seek a life that is faithful to God and of goodness to fellow humans. </p>
<p>Faith in God is a fundamental requirement for the covenant relationship </p>
<p>with God and this is what is expected of believers, especially in the face of </p>
<p>outside ridicule and questioning of the Christian teachings. This is the mes-</p>
<p>sage that is central to 2 Peter’s exhortation to the Petrine community to hold </p>
<p>fast to the promises of God given through God’s spokespersons and to trust </p>
that God’s plans, even the so called delay, have a divine purpose behind them.
<p>In fact, 2 Peter makes it clear that believers can play a direct role in </p>
<p>hastening the arrival of the Day of the Lord, not by speculating about it, </p>
