<p>Jude 1–2</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>notion of addressing oneself as a slave, even metaphorically, may not en-</p>
<p>dear the author to his audience. However, whose slave you are, may matter </p>
<p>in such cases, just as we have seen in the examples above. One is bound to </p>
<p>listen to an important person’s slave when the message communicated is </p>
<p>understood to be, without doubt, from the master.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Yet, it is also possible</p>
<p>that the identity of doulos may have been deliberately chosen by Jude to </p>
<p>challenge the false teachers’ self-perception as those with freedom to do </p>
<p>whatever they wanted. </p>
<p>Overall, if Jude’s audience is—Gentile as the Byzantine Lectionary as-</p>
<p>serts—and if this is understood in light of v. 3 (our common salvation) </p>
<p>where the author stresses the commonality of his faith with that of the re-</p>
<p>cipients of the letter, it would suggest the possibility that he nds the need </p>
<p>to identify with an audience that does not share a common heritage with </p>
<p>him. For this reason, by nding the need to highlight the shared or com-</p>
<p>mon salvation, he intends to remove any doubt that may prevail among </p>
<p>the readers about their place in God’s plan of salvation. In this regard, the </p>
<p>likelihood would be that the author is of Jewish heritage whose close iden-</p>
<p>tication with a Jewish messiah gure (his self-identication as brother of </p>
<p>James, and therefore, half-brother of Jesus puts him in a privileged posi-</p>
<p>tion) whose intent is to make a conscious choice to identify with believers </p>
<p>whose heritage puts them outside of this racial (or seeming privileged) </p>
<p>relationship to Jesus. </p>
<p>Not only is the audience assured of this common salvation, but the </p>
<p>author wants to ascertain this as a concrete commitment—it is secured by </p>
<p>Jesus, the Messiah. is is an armation not only of the reliability of the </p>
<p>security over time, but also the condence of its ability to, always reliably, </p>
<p>protect from any danger. </p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: True Christian Identity</p>
<p>As an African, I am strongly aware of the fact that tribal identity is a central </p>
<p>part of all African communities. Just like doulos (slave), the concept of “tribe” </p>
<p>has negative connotations and has been used to denigrate African social </p>
<p>structures in colonial and postcolonial discourse. I am fully aware of this but </p>
<p>I choose to use the term anyway since it provokes similar reactions to doulos, </p>
<p>and also it provides the parlance of the menacing “tribalism” (ethnocentrism), </p>
