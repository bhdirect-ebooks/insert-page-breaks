<p>Jude 10–11</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>Ultimately, the point is that the arrogance of the inltrators is placed </p>
<p>in stark contrast from the meekness of the powerful heavenly being who, </p>
<p>though he could be justied in claiming a greater sense of authority than </p>
<p>mortals (Dan 12:1; Rev 12:7), nevertheless approaches delicate matters </p>
<p>with a decided sense of humility.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>Even while representing God, Michael</p>
<p>the archangel never presumes the role of Judge; that role belongs to God. </p>
<p>Rather, by appealing to God’s authority, he is able to invoke God’s judgment </p>
<p>without undermining God’s position. By implication, those inltrators </p>
<p>making judgments of others are in essence playing God, by virtue of which </p>
they put themselves in danger of divine judgment.
<p>Infiltrators as Blasphemous (vv. 10–11)</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Yet how much these, who do not understand, are blaspheming </p>
<p>and how they are governed by natural instincts, as brutes without </p>
<p>rational reason, x their thoughts, [and] are destroyed by these </p>
<p>things. </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Woe to them, for they have followed the path of Cain </p>
<p>and the error of Balaam, reaping the wages, and just as Korah’s </p>
<p>rebellion, are destroyed. </p>
<p>While the otherwise powerful archangel Michael displays extraordinary </p>
<p>restraint and humility; in contrast, the arrogance of the inltrators and </p>
<p>their inability to master any restraint has placed them at the lowest of rank </p>
<p>of creation—they are brutes with no self-control. e inltrators are de-</p>
<p>scribed as ignorant of the working of the Christian God, which results in </p>
<p>their blaspheming. It is not that they do not have the capacity to compre-</p>
<p>hend or understand, rather they deliberately refuse to accept the nature </p>
<p>of the Christian faith and as a result of this failure their actions lead them </p>
<p>to do things that are destructive to the faith and ultimately to themselves. </p>
<p>It is not simply lack of knowledge, but, more probably, stubbornness on </p>
<p>their part, allowing themselves to be governed by basic instincts rather than </p>
<p>rational reasoning.</p>
<p>Yet, stereotyping language continues in this verse with the inltrators </p>
<p>compared to wild animals (zōon) led by instincts (phusikōs) and with no </p>
<p>rational thought (alogos).</p>
<p>63</p>
<p> It makes it unlikely that this is a literal descrip-</p>
<p>tion of their behavior. Rather, more likely, it is a gurative characterization </p>
<p>62. Charles 1994: 13: “Michael as a paradigm presents the irony of true spirituality—</p>
<p>humble recognition of spiritual powers over against mindless profanity.”</p>
