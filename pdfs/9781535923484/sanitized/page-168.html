<p>2 Peter 3:11–16</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>concerning the fate of the world in a cataclysmic conagration, the author </p>
<p>then poses the question he would like to address—what kind of lives ought </p>
<p>you to live? In other words, “Knowing what we now know, how should </p>
<p>our day to day life look like?” He proceeds to highlight two virtues that es-</p>
<p>sentially encapsulate the list of virtues he had already laid out earlier—holy </p>
<p>conduct (anastrophe) and godliness (eusebeia). </p>
<p>In essence, this lifestyle has already been elaborated on by the author </p>
<p>in 1:3–7, where the virtues that characterize holy conduct and lead to godli-</p>
<p>ness are laid out. Remaining faithful to God by maintaining godly conduct </p>
<p>is the best way to be sure that one will be found faithful when the day ar-</p>
<p>rives like a thief. In other words, capitulating to what the “scoers” advocate </p>
<p>would only lead to destruction, given the guarantee that the day of the </p>
<p>Lord will come. </p>
<p>e impact of this holy conduct and godliness that the readers should </p>
<p>pursue is to quicken the arrival of the day of God (it is essentially equiva-</p>
<p>lent to the day of the Lord [3:10] and the parousia [1:16; 3:4]). What the </p>
<p>“scoers” have grumbled about, the apparent delay of the day of God, the </p>
<p>author says it can actually be speeded up (and perhaps conversely slowed </p>
<p>down, 3:8–9) by the church’s faithfulness to godly lives.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is seems counterintuitive given that he has already reprimanded the </p>
“scoers” that divine timing cannot be accounted for in the limited ability of humans to understand time from a divine vantage (3:8). But what the
<p>“scoers” were doing is not only questioning its delay, but by implication, </p>
<p>suggesting it will never come. So here, 2 Peter urges his readers to strive for </p>
<p>godliness and holy conduct for these are what are going to hasten the day </p>
of God. is mention of how human conduct can inuence divine time-
<p>tables may have a Jewish background (Isa 60:22; Sir. 36:10; 2 Apoc. Bar. </p>
<p>20:1–2; 54:1; 83:1), even though in those texts it is God who hastens the </p>
<p>days.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Nonetheless, even when it is God who is said to hasten the day, it is</p>
<p>still in reaction to human response, just like it is here in 2 Peter. </p>
<p>It is not clear what the provenance of the promise in verse 13 is that the </p>
<p>author appeals to, but he seems to use the word epangelia (promise) here, </p>
<p>and in 1:4, as an inclusio (a way of bracketing the entire book)—we started </p>
<p>with a promise and we end with a promise. Yet it is also clear that he is </p>
<p>25. Lucas and Green 1995: 146. Juxtaposing this to the Lord’s prayer, “Whenever we </p>
<p>pray ‘Your Kingdom come,’ we are asking God to intervene in that nal climactic way; </p>
<p>but we are also committing ourselves to live as his subjects.” </p>
