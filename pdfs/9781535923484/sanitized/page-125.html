<p>Excursus: Aselgeia</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>and posturing, used in order to give legitimacy to the in-group while vilifying </p>
<p>the out-group—the pseudodidaskaloi.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Support for such understanding is found in the intra- and inter-group </p>
<p>discourse among Greco-Roman associations that constantly contrasts aselgaia </p>
<p>with euse¯ beia (piety/godliness). It is the case that when used in associations to </p>
<p>distinguish between those eligible for membership, the noun euse¯ beia is usu-</p>
<p>ally related to one’s faithful performance of duties pertaining to speciﬁc dei-</p>
<p>ties connected to the associations or groups. For example, inscriptions from </p>
<p>Piraeus, Greece, IG II2 1327 and IG II2 1328, describe euse¯beia as actions </p>
<p>towards the deities, with the latter elaborating that the subject as having been </p>
<p>“zealous that the customary sacriﬁces to the gods be made, often paying for </p>
<p>these himself.”</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>It was not an ethereal construct but a practical performance</p>
<p>of the cultic requirements and duties pertaining to the gods or goddesses.</p>
<p>e assumption by the author seems be that a rejection of the way of truth </p>
<p>(teachings that he considers orthodox) by the so-called false-teachers sim-</p>
<p>ply leads to an out of control lifestyle (morally), and blasphemy (theologi-</p>
<p>cally). e same is true in the way it is used in Jude 4, where rejection of the </p>
<p>lordship of Jesus is also said to lead straight to aselgeia. at is why 2 Peter </p>
<p>characterizes the false-teachers as enemies of way of the truth! (he hodos </p>
<p>tes alētheias). </p>
<p>In the entire NT, the closest approximation of the phrase “way of </p>
<p>God’s truth” only occurs in the gospels (Matt 22:16; Mark 12:14; Luke </p>
<p>20:21), even though there are parallels in 2 Peter—the right way (hodos </p>
<p>euthus), the contrary way of Balaam (hodos Balaa<span class="_ _0" />m<span class="ff2 ls0 ws122">) (<span class="ws0">2:15</span>), and <span class="ff3 ws131">the way o<span class="_ _0" />f </span></span></p>
<p>righteousness (ten hodon tes dikaiosunes—2:21). ose who fail to follow </p>
<p>the way of truth or “the right way,” which is also “the way of righteousness,” </p>
<p>end up following the “wrong way,” which is also the way of falsehood, and </p>
<p>which is also called the way of Balaam. Essentially, this is a simple binary: </p>
<p>there are two ways or paths, and the way or path that one chooses deter-</p>
<p>mines where one ends. </p>
<p>e notion of unfettered excess continues from the previous verse </p>
<p>where 2 Peter describes it as aselgeia, and in 2:3; the false-teachers are de-</p>
<p>scribed as having an insatiable greed (pleonexia), which ultimately leads to </p>
