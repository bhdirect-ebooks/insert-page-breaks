<p>2 Peter 1:16–21</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>(1:1).</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>e words attributed to the voice at the holy mountain proclaimed</p>
<p>about Jesus, “is is my son whom I love, in whom I am well pleased” </p>
<p>(v. 17) echo the words proclaimed from the cloud at Jesus’ baptism and </p>
<p>transguration in the Gospels (Mat 3:17; Mar 1:11; Luke 3:22—baptism; </p>
<p>Mat 17:5; Mar 9:7; Luke 9:35—transguration).</p>
<p>70</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the following verse, the author of 2 Peter claries that this was no </p>
<p>ordinary voice, by explaining that the voice “we” heard came from heaven </p>
<p>(ouranos) (v. 18). In light of the accusations about reliability of the author’s </p>
<p>teachings (v. 16) as myth, this must be understood as part of the author’s </p>
<p>apologetic regarding the reliability of the message given that its origin is </p>
divine. Standing behind this notion of heavenly voice as divine, is the Jewish tradition of bat qol (lit. “daughter of a voice” or “divine voice”) where a
<p>disembodied voice is understood as the voice of God, harking back to the </p>
<p>giving of the law on Mt. Sinai (Exod 20; Deut 4:12). While it is true that </p>
<p>in Jewish tradition the Scriptures were held as higher than the bat qol, the </p>
<p>transguration of Jesus involved more than just a voice from heaven and un-</p>
<p>veiled Jesus in his glorious majesty evident in his physical transformation.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Megaloprepeia, translated here as majestic glory is a hapax legome-</p>
<p>non in NT (appears only here in the entire NT), but is found in Aristotle </p>
<p>(Eth. Nic. VI 1123a18–27, 1107b16–20—“a public lavish nancial spend-</p>
<p>ing which oen took place in associations/clubs, and among aristocrats”), </p>
<p>and in Plato’s Republic (402c, 490c, 494b, 536a, 486a, and 503c), where the </p>
<p>meaning is a public display of magnanimity, magnicence or generosity. </p>
<p>e same act of megaloprepeia could be interpreted either positively (dis-</p>
<p>play of prestige and power) or negatively (tyrannical display of power).</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It had connection to conspicuous nancial generosity, mostly by aristocrats </p>
<p>as a sign of social standing, and was one of the virtues that motivated Athe-</p>
<p>nian aristocrats to participate in liturgies.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>e vocabulary also echoes</p>
<p>that which is found in Greco-Roman associations where it describes the </p>
<p>lustrous occasion of splendor. </p>

<p>70. Bauckham (1983: 204–12) spends some good amount space to refute indepen-</p>
<p>dent provenance of 2 Peter’s quotation, its relationship to the Gospel accounts and its </p>
<p>relation to other references to the saying. </p>
