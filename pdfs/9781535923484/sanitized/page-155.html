<p>2 PETER 3</p>
<p>Reminder to Readers to Be Vigilant (3:1–2)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>is now, beloved, is the second letter that I am writing to you. In </p>
<p>them I stir up your remembrance of the pure thinking </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>to remind </p>
<p>you of the words spoken earlier by the holy prophets and the com-</p>
<p>mandments of the lord and savior, [spoken] to you by the apostles. </p>
<p>Turning from announcing the fate of the false-teachers (they, those) to his </p>
<p>addressees (beloved), the author now begins the concluding phase of his </p>
<p>letter. He returns to his earlier focus; eschatological concerns that the false-</p>
<p>teachers have misrepresented making eort to clarify matters and put the </p>
<p>record straight. He refutes their claims about the delayed parousia showing </p>
<p>how imprudent and dangerous the false-teachers’ claims were. He reasserts </p>
<p>the certainty and reliability of God’s word and promise, assuring his readers </p>
<p>of the certain and timely arrival of God’s justice on the appointed time. e </p>
<p>encouragement is for the readers to hold on to their faith, and count this </p>
<p>period of seeming delay, as the period of God’s mercy for those in need of </p>
<p>salvation. </p>
<p>He mentions an earlier letter that he wrote to them (the second letter </p>
<p>that I am writing to you), which some scholars presume to be reference to </p>
<p>1 Peter. is is true whether one thinks that 2 Peter is pseudepigraphical or </p>
<p>not—if the former, then the pseudepigraphy seeks to appeal to the apostolic </p>
<p>authority of Peter by connecting it to the more historically defensible Pet-</p>
<p>rine authorship, and if the latter, then the claim is simply stating the fact. </p>
<p>If one holds both letters to be authentic then the understanding would </p>
<p>be that they are the product of the same person. For those who hold both </p>
<p>letters as inauthentic, then the reference is merely a strategic personal re-</p>
<p>mark by the author of 2 Peter aimed at making the current letter sound </p>
<p>authentic. For those who hold 1 Peter as authentic and 2 Peter as not, then </p>
<p>the reference is an eort by the latter pseudepigraphical writer to piggy-</p>
<p>back on the rst letter in order to gain authenticity. </p>
