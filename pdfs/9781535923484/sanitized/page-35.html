<p>2 Peter</p>
<p>Date and Authorship </p>
<p>e author in this letter introduces himself as “Peter, slave of Jesus Christ </p>
<p>and a brother of James,” and goes on to present elements in his writing that </p>
<p>would portray a person intimately familiar with the life of Peter the apostle </p>
<p>(talks of impending death [1:14] prophesied by the Lord), awareness of an </p>
<p>earlier letter he wrote (3:1), familiar with the Gospels (reference to Jesus’ </p>
<p>Transguration—1:17–18, described in Matt 17:1; Mark 9:2–7; Luke 9:28–</p>
<p>35) and also familiar with the writings of Paul (3:15). All these personal </p>
<p>anecdotes would usually provide sucient grounds on which to attribute </p>
<p>the letter to the self-identied author. However, in the case of 2 Peter, it </p>
<p>has not proved to be conclusive and, in fact, has become the premise of </p>
<p>counter-arguments against a Petrine authorship.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Arguments about dating are closely related to those on authorship. </p>
<p>Basically, the positions seem to fall into two categories; of Petrine author-</p>
<p>ship (including use of amanuensis), which would give it an early pre-70 CE </p>
<p>dating, versus pseudepigraphic writing which puts it between 70 CE and </p>
<p>125 CE. But if it was written before Peter’s death then it has to be dated </p>
<p>before 64 CE. is letter is perhaps the one NT writing to which most mod-</p>
<p>ern scholars overwhelmingly assign pseudepigraphic authorship. From </p>
<p>very early on in the life of the church, the authenticity of this book has </p>
<p>been questioned, albeit for diering reasons. While the letter very clearly </p>
<p>states its author as “Simeon Peter, slave and apostle of Jesus Christ” (1:1), it </p>
<p>does not seem to have a clear historical trail among the canonical writings </p>
<p>for the rst two centuries of the Church. e rst time the letter is clearly </p>
<p>mentioned by name is by Origen at the beginning of the third century, who </p>
<p>though clearly citing it as Scripture, explained that it was still a disputed </p>
<p>writing within the Christian circles.</p>
