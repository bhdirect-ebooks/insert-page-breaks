<p>Introduction to Jude and 2 Peter</p>
<p>General Introduction</p>
<p>No longer can we maintain the o-quoted declaration made about three </p>
<p>decades ago, that the so-called Petrine epistles (and Jude) are the most ne-</p>
<p>glected books in the New Testament.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>True, the Gospels and the writings</p>
<p>of Paul continue to dominate Biblical and eological Studies, but the last </p>
<p>een to twenty years have seen a steady stream of publication of com-</p>
<p>mentaries, journal articles, and conference papers that have increased the </p>
<p>prole of General Epistle studies in the discipline. Such growth has even </p>
<p>warranted the formation of a “James, Peter and Jude” section at the an-</p>
<p>nual Society of Biblical Literature, which has brought a good discussion </p>
<p>platform and engendered the publication of several signicant studies in-</p>
<p>cluding Reading Jude with New Eyes, Reading 2 Peter with New Eyes, and </p>
<p>Reading 1–2 Peter and Jude: A Resource for Students.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>While the collective</p>
<p>amount of publications in this area of the NT are only a fraction of volumes </p>
<p>produced in the studies of Jesus and Paul, they nevertheless represent a </p>
<p>positive trend. </p>
<p>My cursory count of stand-alone commentaries on 2 Peter and Jude </p>
<p>(or James and Jude) has unearthed no less than twenty-ve in the last </p>
<p>twenty years, making an average of at least a commentary a year in the </p>
<p>last quarter century alone.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>at is not counting commentaries in single</p>
<p>1. Rowston 1975: 554–63; Cf. Elliott 1976: 243–54, in 1 Peter. Elliot’s own commen-</p>
<p>tary on 1 Peter (2000) with over seventy pages of bibliographic material is evidence of </p>
<p>interest in the letter had sustained, perhaps instigated by his earlier comments about the </p>
<p>neglect.</p>
<p>2. Davids and Webb 2008; Watson and Webb 2010; Mason and Martin 2014.</p>
<p>3. Recent inux of studies on 2 Peter and Jude as reected in the number of commen-</p>
<p>taries that have been produced, has brought some long-needed focus on the letters but </p>
<p>this does not preclude the fact that in comparison with studies on the Gospels and Pau-</p>
<p>line literature, the numbers on these letters pale. e list includes—Grundmann 1986; </p>
<p>Paulsen 1992; Neyrey 1993; Chester and Martin 1994; Holmer 1994; Krimmer and Hol-</p>
<p>land 1994; Vögtle 1994; Moo 1996; Horrell 1998; G. Bray 2000; Schelkle 2002; Krachick </p>
