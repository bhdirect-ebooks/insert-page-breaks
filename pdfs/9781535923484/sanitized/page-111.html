<p>Refuting Accusations</p>

<p>24:30; Mark 13:26; Luke 21:27; 2 ess 1:7; Rev 4:11; 17:13). Nonetheless, </p>
<p>if connected to v. 19 the case could be made for OT prophets (cf. pg.95).</p>
<p>Like a conquering ruler whose arrival among conquered subjects evi-</p>
<p>dences his/her power, Jesus’ arrival with power will be to judge the world: </p>
<p>those who have denied the nal judgment and its cataclysmic end (3:10–13) </p>
<p>and the faithful to eternal heavenly abode. e general assumption here is </p>
<p>that this reference to power and coming/appearance of Jesus clearly an-</p>
<p>ticipates the elaboration of vv. 17–18, about the majestic glorication that </p>
<p>occurred in the mountain. However, it also evokes the accusation that the </p>
<p>false-teachers have levied in calling the gospel message a myth. </p>
<p>Having already declared that he and the community are co-sharers in </p>
<p>Go d’s honor (1:1), the author now makes clear that Jesus, by virtue of God’s </p>
own declaration was the recipient of divine glory, honor, and authority
<p>(v. 16–17). On this matter, the community must rest assured that one who </p>
<p>bore actual witness to those events now conrms that this is not a fairy tale.</p>
<p>While evidencing some dierences, the background here is that of the </p>
<p>transguration tradition of Jesus on the mount, found in the gospels (Matt </p>
<p>17:1–6; Mark 9:1–7), where three disciples John, Peter, and James, were </p>
<p>eyewitness of Jesus’ glorication.</p>
<p>60</p>
e same statement about Jesus’ divine
<p>son-ship had been earlier spoken at his baptism by John the baptizer (Matt </p>
<p>3:16–17; Mark 1:9–11; Luke 3:21–22), commemorating the beginning of </p>
<p>his ministry. In that case, as is the case here, a voice from heaven spoke the </p>
<p>words, “Behold, this is my beloved son.” </p>
<p>Nonetheless, it does seem peculiar that this would be the event out </p>
<p>of the life of Jesus that the author would choose to highlight as evidence of </p>
<p>God’s power, since one would have thought the crucixion and resurrection </p>
<p>of Jesus were, by far, more central for Christian apologetics; at least, they </p>
were for Paul. Also, since the divine voice was also heard saying the same
<p>words about Jesus—at his baptism by John and at the transguration—why </p>
<p>would the latter have precedence over the former? However, if these events </p>
<p>are ones that opponents have pointed to as cleverly devised myths/tales </p>
<p>with no basis in historical fact, in order to cast doubt at the teachings of </p>
<p>the author to the community, then it makes sense that the author would be </p>
<p>responding directly to them. </p>
<p>60. Bauckham 1983: 205–10, articulates arguments for 2 Peter’s independent prov-</p>
<p>enance of the tradition, but also concludes that the reference is indisputably to the </p>
<p>Transguration. </p>
