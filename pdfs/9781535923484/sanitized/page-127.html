<p>creation, and does not ever seem to have been carried out at any point in </p>
<p>history.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>In the HB/OT, reference to God slumbering (nustazō) is usually a </p>
<p>ridicule of a God and show of disdain for the God’s lack of control, power, </p>
<p>and authority.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>e same attitude is reected in the false-teacher’s ridicule</p>
<p>of the delayed return (parousia) of the Lord (3:4), spoken with the intent </p>
<p>to cast doubt as to the trustworthiness of the teachings earlier delivered to </p>
<p>the community by the author. It reects not just the doubts of a struggling </p>
<p>agnostic, but rather the convictions of one who has come to the conclusion </p>
<p>that he/she cannot believe in the teachings about Jesus that are espoused </p>
by the author, because he/she foresees no evidence of divine punishment.
<p>erefore, 2 Peter sees no hope such ones as their questioning of God’s </p>
<p>authority would simply bring upon them swi judgment. In contrast to the </p>
<p>view of the false-teachers, the fact that the pronouncements were made </p>
<p>so long ago makes the arrival of this judgment that much more certain to </p>
<p>happen soon. at is why the next section (vv. 4–11) then proceeds to list </p>
examples of divine judgments that, in the past, came against those who
<p>disobeyed God; to serve as warning to the false-teachers and their followers </p>
of the certainty of divine judgment if they remain in the path they are on.

<p>For, if God did not spare angels that sinned, but in chains con-</p>
<p>ned them in darkness in Tartarus, until they were delivered </p>
<p>into judgment, </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>nor was the ancient world spared, even though </p>
<p>as the eighth, Noah, preacher of righteousness, was saved from </p>
<p>the deluge that brought judgment on the ungodly, </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>and the cities </p>
<p>of Sodom and Gomorra were reduced to ashes and made them </p>
<p>an example of what will come to the ungodly.</p>

<p>But righteous Lot, </p>
<p>greatly troubled by the lawlessness and their behavior of unbridled </p>
<p>living, [God] rescued. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>For this righteous one, seeing and hearing </p>
<p>their lawlessness as he lived among them from day to day, was </p>
<p>tortured in his righteous soul. </p>
