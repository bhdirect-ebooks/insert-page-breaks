<p>Personal Reflections of Impending Death by Author </p>
<p>(1:12–15)</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>erefore, I will deliberately always remind you about this, al-</p>
<p>though you already know and are established in the revealed truth. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>And I consider it right, for as long as I am in this tent of a body, </p>
<p>to stir up your memory </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>because I know, soon I will put o my </p>
<p>tent just as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me. </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>But I will </p>
<p>be diligent so that at any time, aer my departure, you will be able </p>
<p>to remember these things. </p>
<p>is section represents a “testament” of the author; testaments are part of </p>
ancient writings that bear farewell statements of great individuals just be-
<p>fore their demise. e record of testaments that we have from the Jewish </p>
<p>tradition tend to be ctive recordings of the last words of dying patriarchs </p>
<p>or matriarchs, and drawing authority on such premise of the nal will for </p>
<p>followers or disciples of such as person.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A well known Jewish example of this genre is the apocryphal writ-</p>
<p>ing from the second century CE, Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In it, </p>
<p>we have what the author(s) imagined to have been the last words (“testa-</p>
<p>ments”) of Jacob’s twelve sons, recorded at their deathbed, as their nal </p>
<p>wish and instruction for their progeny. In the NT, farewell speeches appear </p>
<p>in John 13–17; Acts 20:17–38 and 2 Tim 4:6–8, all which predict arrival of </p>
<p>opponents following the departure of the apostolic gure.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, other elements found in testaments are missing in the NT </p>
<p>examples. As Kugler points out, in the NT examples there is no “deathbed </p>
<p>scene, ancient gure from Israel’s past, death, burial, [and] response. More </p>
<p>importantly [they] lack the most consistent element, the third-person nar-</p>
<p>rative framework.”</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>Because of their nature as nal statements of a departing leader or </p>
<p>signicant gure, testaments tend to focus on ethics exhorting readers to </p>
<p>keep on the path of teachings already relayed by the departing gure.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>is would t well with 2 Peter’s instructions so far in this letter which have </p>
<p>laid out the virtues that are to build the community unto eternal life (vv. </p>
<p>5–11). e main parallels with testaments in this section are the author’s </p>
