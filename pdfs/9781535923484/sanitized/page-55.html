<p>of “delement” which also may presume sexual or other moral, miscon-</p>
<p>duct. Furthermore, the insinuation that the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah </p>
<p>involved the sexual desire of a dierent esh also again seems to presup-</p>
<p>pose some form of angelic sexual contact. All these juxtapositions of what </p>
<p>Jude considers godly or moral contra that which he perceives to be sexual </p>
<p>deviance seems to imply that these are caricatures of two diametrically op-</p>
<p>posed extremes, which, like light/darkness, day/night or true/false, make a </p>
<p>stark distinction between the two spheres of either morality or spirituality. </p>
<p>Similarly, Charis, cannot simply be narrowly dened here, if through-</p>
<p>out, aselgeia’s constant contrast is with the notion of godliness.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>erefore,</p>
<p>the meaning of grace here has to be the larger meaning encompassing salva-</p>
<p>tion, since aselgeia is more than simply sexual aberration and represents a </p>
<p>form of sinfulness that ultimately results in the denial of our only master </p>
<p>and Lord, Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>Jude’s emphasis that the only (monos) lord and master is Jesus (cf. </p>
<p>also v. 24) also reects a clear anti-Empire rhetoric that sets up Jesus as </p>
<p>the anti-Caesar, who deserves the readers’ total loyalty.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>e Majority Text</p>
<p>adds theos (“God”—“the only master, God and Lord, Jesus Christ”), mak-</p>
<p>ing the contrast that much more plain, given that the Roman Emperor in </p>
the Imperial cult was considered divine—a god or son of the gods.
<p>32</p>
<p>As</p>
<p>Philip Harland points out, “Fittingly honoring gods and emperors was a </p>
<p>means by which families, associations, cities, and larger regions helped to </p>
<p>ensure the safety and security of their communities.”</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>is would place</p>
<p>Jude’s community in direct challenge to, not only other groups and asso-</p>
<p>ciations within the Empire, but also at odds with the expectations of the </p>
<p>Roman government. However, it is important to clarify that even though </p>
<p>Jude’s rhetoric and beliefs may indicate anti-Empire sentiments, it is unlike-</p>
<p>ly that Jude himself, and Jude’s community, was overtly actively involved </p>
<p>30. See Beard et al. (1998: 224–25), on eusebeia in Roman religions—practical </p>
<p>involvement in cultic and prayer activities of the religion rather than a contemplative </p>
<p>aspect of faith.</p>
<p>31. For example, inscriptions from Asia Minor: ISmyrna 731—“. . . Ceasar Domitian </p>
<p>son of god Vespasian Augustus”(AGRW 116), and IEph 3801 (c. 45–54 CE) Asia Minor </p>
<p>marble slab: “Caesar-loving highpriest of Asia and life-long director of contests for god-</p>
<p>dess Roma and god Augustus Caesar, Zeus Patroos (“Ancestral”), emperor and greatest </p>
<p>highpriest, father of the fatherland and of the whole race of humankind” (AGRW 160).</p>
32. Rohun Park 2007: Conversely, Park connects this title to divinity of Jesus. While
<p>plausible, it is unwarranted in the way Jude presents Jesus.</p>
