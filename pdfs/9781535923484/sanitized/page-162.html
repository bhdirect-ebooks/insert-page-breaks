<p>2 Peter 3:5–7</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>is compared to baptism. Here, 2 Peter does not mention baptism or even </p>
<p>Noah, whom he had already mentioned in 2:5 as an example of the righ-</p>
<p>teous person who can expect salvation at the time of judgment. So while </p>
<p>emphasizing the role of water in this section, its role both in creation and </p>
<p>judgment, 2 Peter is not inuenced by 1 Peter 3:21’s connection of the Noah </p>
<p>event to baptism. </p>
<p>While there is no doubt that the creation myth from Genesis looms </p>
<p>large in this section of 2 Peter, there is also the possibility that, due to the </p>
<p>combination of water and re imageries here, the background may be the </p>
<p>Stoic teaching of elemental re as source of all things which followed cy-</p>
<p>clical patters of dissolution, water-re-water.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>It is true that the image of</p>
<p>re as the instrument of judgment in the anticipated day of the Lord is </p>
<p>reected in some Jewish writings (Deut 32:22; Isa 33:11–12; Zeph 1:18; </p>
<p>Zech 12:6, Mal 4:1). </p>
<p>However, 2 Peter still maintains that it is the same word (logos) that </p>
<p>brought the waters of creation that will also bring the re of destruction. </p>
<p>While the water also did bring complete decimation of life in the world </p>
<p>(Noah), it did not destroy the world. It is, therefore, unlikely that the re </p>
<p>would completely annihilate the world, but rather it would be expected to </p>
<p>purge it of impurities. </p>
<p>e language of destruction (apollymi) and judgment (kriseos) is </p>
<p>specic to the ungodly (asebēs) and not to creation as a whole, at least not </p>
<p>in this section. Even the language in 3:9–12 about the dissolving (lyō) of </p>
<p>the heavens and the melting of the elements by heat (kausoō) may not indi-</p>
<p>cate the total annihilation of the present creation to be replaced by a totally </p>
<p>dierent and new one (3:13). Rather, it points to a wiping clean of the cre-</p>
<p>ation, just like the ood did in wiping out the old and beginning anew, so </p>
<p>that what is le is completely transformed and renewed.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It would seem, then, that the author does not quite answer the issue of </p>
<p>the delayed return of the Lord in the rst response, focusing instead on the </p>
<p>longevity of the creation. He alludes to the antediluvian destruction of the </p>
world during the time of Noah as a sure sign that divine judgment is certain
<p>to visit the ungodly again soon. </p>
