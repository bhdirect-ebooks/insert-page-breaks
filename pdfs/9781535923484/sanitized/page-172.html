<p>2 Peter 3:17–18</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>Final Exhortation and Conclusion (3:17–18)</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>You therefore, beloved, knowing beforehand, [continue to] </p>
<p>guard yourselves against the misleading lawless error [which </p>
<p>would cause you] to fall out of your foundation. </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>But grow in </p>
<p>grace and knowledge of our lord and savior Jesus Christ. To him </p>
<p>be glory both now and forever, amen. </p>
<p>e author brings his epistle to a close with an expression of condence in </p>
<p>both the knowledge that his readers have (thanks to his letter?) about the </p>
<p>dangers surrounding them, and how to overcome them. He is condent </p>
<p>they are in a secure spot. No doubt, his condence is based on the convic-</p>
<p>tion that he has now alerted them about the dangers that the false-teachers </p>
<p>pause, especially with their teachings to which the misleading lawless er-</p>
<p>ror (athesmos planē) must refer. e phrase combines the idea of lawless-</p>
<p>ness and deception (2:7, 18), and most likely has as its subject the content of </p>
<p>the false-teachers’ teachings. ere no longer is ignorance for his audience, </p>
<p>and therefore, they should be able to deal with the highlighted dangers, and </p>
<p>avoid falling from their solid foundation. </p>
<p>eirs is a stērigmos, a rmly xed position, which they should make </p>
<p>every eort to maintain. Since the knowledge (gnosis) they had beforehand </p>
<p>was sucient to set them in the rm spot, growing in grace and knowl-</p>
<p>edge of our Lord and Jesus would only further ground them in their secure </p>
<p>place. It is the sure way to remain rmly rooted in the apostolic teachings </p>
<p>and in the faith in the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p>He closes the letter in similar fashion to his opening—with a refer-</p>
<p>ence to the “Lord and Savior.” We have already made the case for the politi-</p>
<p>cal nature of this reference to Jesus as Lord and Savior (see comments on </p>
<p>1:11). e letter opened with the address to the readers as To those equally </p>
<p>honored (isotimon–hapax) with us to receive (lanchanō) the faith in righ-</p>
<p>teousness of our God (theou) and Savior, Jesus Christ, and now closes </p>
<p>with the author imploring them to grow in grace and knowledge (gnosis) </p>
<p>of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Assured that they are part of the elect </p>
<p>community of God, the author now entreats them to make certain their </p>
<p>foundation, by continuing to grow in the faith. Growth in a plant is the sure </p>
<p>way to evidence its health and vitality. In the same way, the community’s </p>
<p>continued growth in the faith is thus represented as the sure way to stay </p>
<p>grounded in the faith.</p>
