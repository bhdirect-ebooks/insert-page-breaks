<p>Salutations and Bestowing of Honor on Readers</p>

<p>stowed on an former slave who had served faithfully as a priest of the gods, </p>
<p>while a second slab mentions members being given crowns of honor with </p>
<p>inscriptions (cf. crown in Rev. 2:10).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From a Greco-Roman perspective, the only problem in ascribing hon-</p>
<p>or through Jesus is the fact that Jesus had died an ignoble and dishonorable </p>
<p>death of crucixion—the kind that Roman citizens were exempt. Making </p>
<p>the claim that Jesus is conduit for the said honor would be rather absurd. </p>
<p>Possibly, this may be part of the reason why 2 Peter never mentions the </p>
<p>crucixion and, instead, reckons that Jesus was given honor by God in an </p>
audible conrmation of his divine origin (1:17). It is a level of honor that aords the greatest possible outcome—a measure of imputed divinity upon
<p>the readers (1:3–4). </p>
<p>Whether the rest of the statement is to be translated as our God and </p>
<p>savior, Jesus Christ or our God and our savoir Jesus Christ, has been </p>
<p>interpreters’ dilemma. e former would identify Jesus as God, while the </p>
<p>latter distinguishes between Jesus and God. e grammatical rule (Gran-</p>
<p>ville-Sharp Rule) that states that when a single article (tou—the) governs </p>
<p>both subjects (nouns God and savior), implies that the former translation </p>
<p>should be preferred here.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> Similarly, in 1:11, 2:20, 3:2, 18, where combina-</p>
<p>tions of God and Jesus appear, suggest this is an important classication by </p>
<p>the author. </p>
<p>is seeming ascription of deity to Jesus, the focus of many com-</p>
<p>mentators, may owe its signicance of ascription to a political response to </p>
<p>Roman ascription of deity (apotheosis) to human rulers.</p>

<p>Such ascriptions,</p>
<p>placed on epigraphs in public places, were common in many cities of Asia </p>
<p>Minor. For example, a marble found in Mysia (Kyzikos), Asia Minor, hon-</p>
<p>ors the daughter of king Polemon for her piety towards “the greatest of </p>
<p>the gods, Tiberius Augustus Caesar (tou megistou theon Tiberiou Sebastou </p>
<p>Kaisaros) .”</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>In more than one example, a bronze tablet from Assos, Asia</p>
<p>Minor (IAssos 26, c. 37 CE), has an oath to Caesar inscribed: “We swear to </p>
<p>Zeus Soter (“Savior”), god Caesar Augustus, . . . to have good will towards </p>

<p>11. Some ancient mss (P ψ), possibly uncomfortable with the dilemma or by copyist </p>
<p>error, le out the direct article (tou) in an attempt to clarify that this was a reference to </p>
<p>God and Jesus, as two distinct persons.</p>
