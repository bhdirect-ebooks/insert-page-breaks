<p>Encouragement to Believers</p>

<p>one who has no spirit of God can exemplify strong self control. e binary </p>
<p>holds, only in so far as, this remains a metaphoric comparison.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if the comparison is between the community and the </p>
group of inltrators, rather than individuals (vv. 20–21), then the author
<p>is contrasting the presence of the Holy Spirit in the community to the lack </p>
<p>thereof among the inltrators. And since the community is being kept, or </p>
<p>sustained, by Jesus until the eternal life (vv. 1, 24), Jude can thus speak with </p>
<p>condence about the common community ethos contra that of the inltra-</p>
<p>tors. is strong polemical binary then is a boundary marker, more than </p>
<p>a rendering of the outsiders’ character, since the primary intent is to show </p>
<p>how diametrically opposed the ethos of the two groups are.</p>
<p>Encouragement to Believers (vv. 20–21) </p>
<p>20</p>
<p>But you, beloved, build yourselves up in your most holy faith, </p>
<p>oer prayers in the holy spirit, </p>
<p>21</p>
<p>guard yourselves in God’s love, </p>
<p>anticipating the mercy of our lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. </p>
<p>One again, “But you . . .” continues the contrast being developed between </p>
<p>the inltrators and Jude’s audience. Jude distinguishes between his readers </p>
<p>and those he perceives to be in danger of judgment. It also marks a shi </p>
<p>in focus from the concern about the negative elements of the inltrators </p>
<p>to positive instructions to the author’s beloved, the recipients of his letter. </p>
<p>e previous condemnation is thus to be understood as clearly di-</p>
<p>rected to those who have been identied as inltrators, while now the fo-</p>
<p>cus is on the faithful. In direct contrast to the inltrators, who are causing </p>
divisions (v. 19—apodiorizontes), Jude’s audience is called upon instead,
<p>to build or construct (epoikodomeō) themselves up, as a community. e </p>
<p>third person masculine plural participle indicates that the injunction is for </p>
<p>the whole group. is building-up, then, is a group eort to support one </p>
<p>another even as the inltrators have tried to tear them apart by causing </p>
divisions. e premise on which this building-up will take place is faith
<p>and prayer—the two things that require a sense of communal participation. </p>
A second direct contrast with those dividing the community concerns
<p>the presence of God’s spirit. ose detractors, the author arms, have no </p>
<p>spirit (presumably the spirit of God) while his audience is encouraged to </p>
<p>make their prayer in the Holy Spirit (spirit of God). Each is the antithesis </p>
<p>of the other. While the former lack the spirit of God, the latter must seek </p>
<p>the community’s wellbeing via spirit based prayers and faith. e contrast </p>
