<p>2 Peter 2:20–22</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>would advocate.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> And so, while 2 Peter here seems to emphasize the no-</p>
<p>tion of knowledge as central to one’s salvation, gnōsis in 2 Peter carries with </p>
<p>it both moral concerns and eschatological expectations.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ultimately, this knowledge is not simply a general familiarity but a </p>
<p>true apprehension of something in its entirety, together with all its implica-</p>
<p>tions. It is a full acknowledgment of and trust in something, such that one </p>
<p>is fully transformed by it. is is the saving knowledge that 2 Peter is refer-</p>
<p>ring to. at is why the danger of having arrived at such a place in one’s ex-</p>
<p>perience with Jesus Christ, who is both Lord and Savior (1:11; 3:2, 18), sets </p>
<p>an even worse scenario for the apostates since the same knowledge would </p>
<p>make it clear the fate that is to befall them. Similar warnings are found in </p>
<p>the words of Jesus about the possible return of unclean spirits should they </p>
<p>return to a person aer they have been cast out—his condition is worse in </p>
<p>the end than in the beginning (Matt 12:43–45; Luke 11:24–26). While it is </p>
<p>still not clear how the last state of the apostates is worse than the rst, it may </p>
<p>be based on the understanding of an expression also used by Jesus that, “to </p>
<p>whom much is given much is expected” (Luke 12:48).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>63</p>
<p>e language of hunting returns to explain the state of the false-teach-</p>
<p>ers. Just like they ensnared the new converts, they themselves have been </p>
<p>entangled again and overpowered by their own corruption, making their </p>
<p>fate inevitable. ey are so bound up in their sinfulness there is no hope of </p>
<p>escape. e way of righteousness and the commandments represent the </p>
<p>same thing as the Christian experience, based on the teachings and com-</p>
<p>mands of God given by Jesus through the apostles (cf. 1:19–21; 2:2; 3:2). </p>
<p>e author then nally turns to two pointed proverbs to drive his </p>
<p>point home—“A dog returns to its vomit” (from Prov 26:11) and “A pig </p>
<p>is bathed only to wallow in the mud.” e proverbs simply amplify the </p>
<p>rhetoric in comparing the false-teachers to two derided animals (Lev 11:7; </p>
<p>Deut 14:8; 1 Kings 21:19) known to have habits of returning to lth aer </p>
<p>being cleaned or aer they had regurgitated it. It is, therefore not meant </p>
<p>primarily as an identication of the false-teachers with dogs and pigs—</p>
<p>two animals known in Jewish tradition to be unclean and loathsome for </p>
<p>their repugnant habits. It simply conrms what has already been said about </p>
<p>them; they return to their prior way of life, which does not conform to the </p>
<p>tenets of the Christian faith. </p>
