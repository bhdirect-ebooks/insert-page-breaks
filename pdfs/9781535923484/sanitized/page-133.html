<p>Guarantee of Divine Judgment in the Present</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>In this section, 2 Peter concludes his examples of judgment and rescue with </p>
<p>a general statement about God’s ability to judge and save, and verse nine is </p>
<p>a summation of 2 Peter’s arguments from 2:1 about what God does, in judg-</p>
<p>ment, to those who are unrighteous, and the promise of rescue to those </p>
<p>who are godly. Just in case his readers are overwhelmed by the unrelenting </p>
<p>portrayal of God’s judgment of sinful people in last eight verses, 2 Peter </p>
<p>makes a reassuring proclamation that this same God who judges, is also </p>
<p>very aware of his duty to rescue the godly (eusebēs), and is capable of it as </p>
<p>evidenced by the examples given. As Gene Green puts it: “In a world where </p>
<p>the gods are considered to be capricious and could do a person harm as </p>
<p>well as good, the condence in God as the Deliver is striking indeed…”</p>

<p> </p>
<p>e communities of Noah and Lot, provide the backdrop examples of </p>
<p>what would happen to disobedient people, while Noah and Lot themselves </p>
<p>are the counter-examples of those rescued in the midst of their communi-</p>
<p>ties’ annihilation. Note the use of the same vocabulary for rescue (rhyomai) </p>
used earlier in the description of Lot’s story of divinely assisted escape from
<p>Sodom, and now used here in the generic statement of God’s deliverance </p>
of the godly from divine judgment. is promise of God’s ability to secure
<p>(tēreō) is not just for a limited period, but it goes all the way to the Day of </p>
<p>Judgment (hēmera kriseos), the eschatological end of all time, when God </p>
<p>would judge the all creation based on their works (also called day of the </p>
<p>Lord—Isa 34:8; Prov 6:34; 1 Enoch 22:11).</p>
<p>Following the juxtaposition of the assurance of rescue of the godly, </p>
<p>and judgment of the unrighteous, 2 Peter proceeds to detail who these un-</p>
<p>righteous are. In the same way that he provided a catalogue of virtues that </p>
<p>should characterize the believers (1:5–10), he now similarly catalogues the </p>
<p>characteristics of the ungodly. e list includes categorization of the false-</p>
<p>teachers as walking in the esh (opisō sarkos) and in polluting lust (en </p>
<p>epithymia miasmos), despising authority (kyriatētos), arrogant (tolēros), </p>
<p>and obstinate self-pleasers (authadēs—only other reference in Tit 1:7), </p>
<p>and not afraid to blaspheme the glorious ones (doxas). It is possible that </p>
<p>the rest of the categories elaborate what walking in the esh means for 2 </p>
<p>Peter or that each violation stands alone. </p>
<p>is section derives from Jude 8, which also identies the inltrators </p>
<p>as dreamers. In keeping with modications of his sources, 2 Peter avoids </p>
<p>the reference to dreamers, focusing instead on their polluting acts, dis-</p>
<p>obedience, and arrogance. He also eliminates the reference to archangel </p>
