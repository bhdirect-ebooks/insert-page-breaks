<p>Jude 3–4</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>time of God’s ultimate nal judgment over creation (Joel 2:11, 31; Zeph </p>
<p>1:14; Mal 4:5; Rev 6:17; 16:8). In 1 Enoch 22:11; 4:4, a similar expression </p>
<p>is used in the same manner.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>Jude’s language of “the great judgment,”</p>
<p>however, echoes more precisely 1 Enoch 22:5, 11; 84:4, which is distinct </p>
<p>from the more common biblical expression, “the day of the Lord!.” While </p>
<p>both mean the same thing, the language of Jude approximates more closely </p>
<p>with 1 Enoch. is is further supported by the reference to “chains and fet-</p>
<p>ters” with which Jude describes the angels as being detained (1 En. 22:12). </p>
<p>Finally, in 1 Enoch 22:9–12, the righteous and the sinners are kept apart, </p>
<p>awaiting the great Day of Judgment when eternal blessings for the former </p>
<p>and eternal torment for the latter will be meted out. </p>
<p>e warning is, therefore, made abundantly clear to the inltrators. </p>
<p>Like the angels, they are transgressing the set boundaries by crossing into </p>
Jude’s community and thus setting in motion divine judgment. e element
<p>of exclusivity (belonging to one group) was a central emphasis of group </p>
<p>identity among Christians, even though it was not unique to them, and </p>
<p>may likely not have been the norm as people maintained memberships in </p>
<p>various groups for social, economic, and even cultic reasons.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>It is such a</p>
<p>practice that Jude may have in mind as he focuses attention on the need </p>
for the group’s exclusive divine loyalty. Such strong language also indicates
<p>that a lot is at stake and Jude sees no wiggle room; it is a matter of life and </p>
<p>death, literally.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>In like manner, the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, which also </p>
<p>gave themselves over to sexual immorality and followed aer dif-</p>
<p>ferent type of esh, were exposed to an eternal re to suer pun-</p>
<p>ishment without end. </p>
e third example of divine judgment due to transgression is once again
<p>from Genesis! To continue painting the anticipated unfolding of the dire </p>
<p>fortunes of the inltrators, Jude now turns to the Gen 19:1–25 where the </p>
<p>focus is specically on sexual sin (porneia). Just as the angels mentioned </p>
<p>above are described in the present tense, as continuing to await in chains </p>
<p>for ultimate judgment, similarly the judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah is </p>
<p>also portrayed as still continuing—punishment without end. </p>

<p>48. Harland 2003: 264. “Unlike other associations, participations among Jews and </p>
<p>Christians stopped short of a conscious or active involvement in religious rituals for em-</p>
<p>perors as gods.” However, “[t]he potential for intermittent conicts should not blind us </p>
<p>to areas of participation in civic life by these minorities” (267).</p>
