<p>many trades appropriately honoring the gods was important.”</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>is is also</p>
<p>still true in many African, South American, and Asian communities and </p>
<p>that is why there is general anity to such biblical characters like Jacob, </p>
<p>Joseph, and Daniel given their abilities to interpret dreams.</p>
<p>55</p>
erefore, since dreams were reckoned as pathways of divine con-
<p>tact in the Mediterranean world (Jer 27:9; Daniel 2, 7; Acts 2:17, 10:1–48, </p>
<p>16:9), it is more likely that a deeper spiritual conict may undergird this </p>
<p>accusation. In the Gospels, for example, Joseph, betrothed to Mary was the </p>
<p>recipient, on three dierent occasions of dream messages about his ancée </p>
<p>Mary’s faithfulness, the need to retreat to safety for the sake of Jesus’ life, </p>
<p>and about when to return home, aer Herod’s death (Matt 1:20–21; 2:13; </p>
<p>2:19–20). Similarly, Pilate’s wife warned him about Jesus’ innocence based </p>
<p>on a dream she had about him (Matt 27:19). </p>
<p>Interpretation of dreams in antiquity was taken quite seriously as </p>
a means of divine revelation which proper interpretation was limited to
<p>those with the gi to do so. For example, in the Dream Interpretations by </p>
<p>Artemidorus of Daldis (second century CE), we are introduced to profes-</p>
<p>sional dream interpreters in the Greco-Roman society who functioned as </p>
<p>representatives of the Greco-Roman gods and goddesses.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>What such a</p>
<p>background puts in context is the plausibility that Jude’ opponents are bas-</p>
ing their conduct on claims of divine revelation in the tradition of dream
<p>interpreters, which Jude then attacks as the rejection of the rightful lordship </p>
<p>of God.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>And, in that regard, it may be safe to say that Jude’s use of the term</p>
<p>“dreamers” is denitely not simply metaphorical in this instance. However, </p>
<p>it would be faulty to assume that the dream tradition was a reection of </p>
<p>Gnostic background for the inltrators, as some commentators have.</p>

<p>55. Virtually every leader of African indigenous churches identied dreams as the </p>
<p>source of their calling.</p>
<p>56. Harland 2003: 62–3; Artemidorus 1975: 7. ough Artemidorus wrote in the 2nd </p>
<p>century CE, he uses older sources that indicate that the tradition of dream interpreters </p>
<p>was in existence even before rst century CE Greco-Roman society. While revisiting the </p>
<p>question of whether dreams come from gods or an inner self, Artemidorus seems to want </p>
<p>distinguish his perception from the popular understanding of their source (1:6). </p>
<p>57. For example, in an inscription from Delos (c. 200 BCE), the priest Apollonios </p>
<p>writes concerning the instructions to dedicate a temple to Serapis. AGRW 221 = IG XI,4 </p>
<p>1299: “…the god instructed me through a dream that I should dedicate his own temple of </p>
<p>Sarapis (Sarapieion), and that he was not to be in rented rooms anymore.”</p>
