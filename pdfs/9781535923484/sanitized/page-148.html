<p>2 Peter 2:17–19</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>desires (epithymia sarkos). Deriving from Jude, the reference to eshly de-</p>
<p>sires has been understood as a plausible reference to sexual sin, with some </p>
<p>commentators identifying it specically with homosexuality, by account of </p>
<p>the mention of esh (sarkos) here as harking back to Jude 7–8.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>in our reckoning, it still remains within the realm of accusations that con-</p>
<p>stitute stereotypes of enemies as sexual perverts. </p>
<p>ere seem to be at least four distinct groups identied in this section—</p>
<p>false-teachers (bombastic preachers), true Christian believers—Petrine </p>
<p>community, recent converts, and those living in error (planē—paganism </p>
<p>or idolatry).</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>e recent converts came out of the last group, who continue</p>
<p>in their error, but the false-teachers are misleading them to think that they </p>
<p>do not have to fundamentally change their lives now that they had become </p>
<p>part of the Petrine community. It is this that the author of 2 Peter consid-</p>
<p>ers a bait that the false-teachers are using to mislead the new converts, in </p>
<p>contrast to the author’s already laid out moral expectations for all Christian </p>
<p>believers (1:5–7). </p>
<p>e false-teachers cannot oer the liberty they promise since they </p>
<p>themselves remain enslaved (douloō) to corruption (phthora—“the de-</p>
<p>pravity that exists in the world because of inordinate desire”).</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> e corrup-</p>
<p>tion referred to is not simply moral depravity but the same word appears </p>
<p>in 2:15 (same vocabulary phthora) to establish that this is a more pervasive </p>
degeneracy whose ultimate fate is divine judgment. What they are describ-
<p>ing as freedom is in actuality slavery since, as the aphorism he concludes </p>
<p>with makes clear, one is a slave of what masters him/her. </p>
<p>e contrast to the author’s self-description as a slave (doulos) of </p>
<p>Christ (1:2) cannot be lost here. In essence, he is saying “we are all slaves </p>
<p>to someone or something”—one is a slave to what masters him/her. Never-</p>
<p>theless, we do seem to have a choice in the matter even though the author </p>
<p>virtually eliminates any possibility of the false-teachers claiming Christ’s </p>
<p>lordship since he considers even their current claim to be under the Lord-</p>
<p>ship of Jesus a false claim. On the other hand, he may perceive it from the </p>
<p>vantage point of seeing their current position as being the choice they have </p>
<p>already made, and the nal section of this chapter seems to make the case </p>
<p>for such reasoning. </p>
