<p>2 Peter 2:12–16</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>there were behavioral standards set to maintain order and decorum in the </p>
<p>feasts, and any that would break the regulations risked being ned, being </p>
<p>kicked out, and even loss of membership.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>It is such kind of unbecoming</p>
<p>conduct in light of group gatherings that Harland has indicated the anti-</p>
<p>banquet behavior groups would levy against opponents, which in this case </p>
<p>of 2 Peter, is labeling of the false-teachers as anti-banquet and therefore </p>
<p>generally anti-society.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e description of insatiable sexual desire continues the stereotyping </p>
<p>that casts the barbarian as an out of control sexual slave unt for mem-</p>
<p>bership in a civil society. In later years, Christian gatherings were to be </p>
<p>characterized (falsely!) by opponents as meetings where uncontrolled </p>
<p>and reprehensible sexual acts were performed.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>It is therefore interesting</p>
<p>here that it is the Christian author who labels his opponents as sexually </p>
<p>immoral.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>e phrase on adultery is grammatically awkward since literally it </p>
<p>reads, “they, with eyes full of an adulteress.”</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>is may explain why Greek</p>
<p>manuscripts that contain the epistle of 2 Peter, such as ) A 33, by replacing </p>
<p>moichalidos with moichalias, oer the more rened alternative having eyes </p>
<p>full of adultery. It is also true that when the accusation of adultery is typi-</p>
<p>cally levied against a group in the OT and NT, it is an accusation of idolatry </p>
<p>against those who have rejected God’s commands (Matt 12:39; 16:4; Mark </p>
<p>8:38; Jas 4:4, Rev 2:22). Proverbs 30:13 (LXX) describes a wicked genera-</p>
<p>tion with loy eyes (hyphēlous ophthalmous) and, decries the ways of the </p>
<p>45. Smith and Taussig 2012: 16–17.</p>
<p>46. Writing about the perception of Jews among the Greco-Romans, Harland 2009: </p>
<p>176, explains: “In virtually all the cases in this chapter, the inversion or perversion of </p>
<p>the shared meal, along with inherent sacricial connections, stands out as a symbol of </p>
<p>the group’s relation to surrounding society, as a sign of an anti–societal threat and the </p>
<p>epitome of social and religious disorder.”</p>
<p>47. Harland 2009: 171. “is combination of inverted banqueting and perverted </p>
<p>sexual practices would recur in the list of counter-cultural practices attributed to the </p>
<p>early Christians as well. Livy provides another clear case where ction informed by </p>
<p>ethnographic stereotypes of the criminal tendencies of foreign peoples informs the de-</p>
<p>scription of real-life associations, in this case an association with mysteries. Inversion of </p>
<p>proper banqueting and drinking practices, as well as distorted sacricial rites, are again </p>
<p>at the heart of the allegations.”</p>
<p>48. Wisdom and Philo use similar language to caricature non-Jews. “. . . we are wit-</p>
<p>nessing the expression of Judean or Christian identities in relation to the associations in </p>
<p>a way that illustrates the internalization of external categorizations. . . .” (Harland 2009: </p>
<p>177–78).</p>
<p>49. BDAG 656, translates it as “eyes full of (desire for) an adulteress.”</p>
