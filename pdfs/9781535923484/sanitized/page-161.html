<p>God’s Judgment Is Certain to Come</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>through re, the sentence that describes the role of water makes for a di-</p>
<p>cult reading. It is not clear how water was instrumental (through, by means </p>
<p>of) in the creation of the world with the exception that it evokes Genesis </p>
<p>1:6–9 where God separates the “waters above” from the “waters below,” and </p>
<p>gathers the waters below together, revealing land. However, since his focus </p>
<p>so far has been on the performative word (logos) of God, he maintains the </p>
<p>signicance that logos played in all this (v. 5). e creative waters came </p>
about by the word of God and so will the re of divine judgment, from the
<p>same word. </p>
<p>e “scoers” (they) can only arrive at their faulty conclusion by delib-</p>
<p>erately ignoring (lanthanei) evidence (words) already present before them. </p>
<p>An alternative translation has the “scoers” not deliberately forgetting, but </p>
<p>as forgetting, as a result of, their strong inclination to believe that God’s </p>
<p>promises are unfullled.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Either way, this forgetfulness of the “scoers”</p>
<p>anticipates the encouragement of the 2 Peter’s readers not to be ignorant </p>
<p>(lanthanō) concerning the judgment that will soon arrive with the day of </p>
<p>the Lord (v. 8). </p>
<p>e author’s interest here is to maintain the argument begun in 3:1, </p>
<p>the role of the God’s prophetic word (logos) reected in the old prophet’s </p>
<p>words (rhemata) and the apostles’ commandments (entole). So, not only </p>
<p>did the prophets and apostles speak on behalf of God, at the very beginning </p>
<p>it was this same word of God (tou theou logō) that brought into existence </p>
<p>the whole of creation (v. 5). It was the same word also that brought judg-</p>
<p>ment. God’s word (logos) is the means of both creation (v. 5) and destruc-</p>
<p>tion (v. 7), while it also sustains creation. is imagery of an ecacious </p>
<p>logos, reects some parallels in the Gospel of John 1:1–4, where the logos is </p>
<p>the means of creation. </p>
<p>Consequently, further elaboration is of what the “scoers” fail to </p>
<p>understand—the nature of the cosmos and God’s involvement both in its </p>
<p>creation and judgment. As the initial development of his argument about </p>
<p>God’s conception of time, 2 Peter reverts to the creation imagery that </p>
<p>heavily draws on Jewish creation narratives (Gen 1, Job 28:25, Prov 8, 1 </p>
<p>Enoch 83:3). is section invokes the story of creation in Genesis 1, and </p>
<p>also Genesis 6 where the antediluvian world was destroyed due to human </p>
<p>disobedience. </p>
<p>e same event is referenced in 1 Peter 3:18–22, where the focus on </p>
<p>judgment also relays the story of Noah’s (and his family’s) rescue which </p>
