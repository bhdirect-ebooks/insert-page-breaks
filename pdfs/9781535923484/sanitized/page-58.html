<p>anti-Empire stance. e reference to ho kurios (the Lord) as the one who </p>
<p>once (hapax)</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>saved (sōzō) can be a contrast between God’s ability to save</p>
<p>versus proclamations of Caesar as savior. at Caesar was publicly hailed as </p>
<p>despotes kai soteros (master and savior), makes this contrast rather point-</p>
<p>ed.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>It also continues the military imagery that we noted earlier (cf. p.31).</p>
In this case, it foregrounds the Lord as the true divine warrior that rescued
<p>his people from bondage.</p>
<p>Jude also points out that, while usually the Exodus is held up as an </p>
<p>example of God’s salvation of Israel (the perspective that is consistent with </p>
<p>the Passover celebration and the accompanying Seder meal where the em-</p>
phasis is on the remembrance of divine salvation of Israel), the lesson he
<p>chooses to highlight is that of those who were subsequently destroyed for </p>
<p>unbelief, even aer initially being saved. e emphasis here then is on judg-</p>
<p>ment, even as the aspects of God’s salvation are on display. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Not even the angels, who in the early days did not carefully guard </p>
<p>themselves but forsook their own dwelling/home, in eternal dark-</p>
<p>ness and fetters/chains they are reserved/detained, the rest of their </p>
<p>days, for the great judgment. </p>
Jude continues with his second example of divine judgment for disobedi-ence by turning to the story of divine beings. To make clear the ominous nature of the divine judgment that the inltrators are inviting on themselves and their followers, Jude turns to the legendary divine judgment meted on divine beings in Gen 6:1–4. However, accusations against the “angels” for
<p>Jude are primarily on their failure to observe boundaries and, not on sexual </p>
<p>sin, and reects more of the depiction found in 1 Enoch (1 Enoch 10:4–6; </p>
<p>12:4; 15:3) than in Genesis 6.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>Over time in Jewish history, the text from</p>
Genesis 6 had come to exemplify the inescapability of divine judgment.
<p>In referencing the version found in second century BCE book of 1 </p>
<p>Enoch (10:4–6), the judgment is not on humans but on those identied as </p>
<p>42. Hapax, which usually means “once and for all,” here means “once.” (Cf. BDAG </p>
<p>97:2)</p>
<p>43. According to historian Suetonius, (Jul. 49) in his Vit Caes.(e Twelve Caesars), </p>
<p>Julius Caesar, named “theos kai soteros” (god and savior) following his conquest of the </p>
<p>Eastern Mediterranean, was rst to be deied aer his death in 14 CE. Cf. Fantin (2011), </p>
<p>on similar terminology in Pauline letters and on the Gospels see Verheyden and Van </p>
<p>Belle 2014.</p>
<p>44. Charles 1994: 7. “. . . whereas in 1 Enoch 6–10, Jub. 5:1 and 2 Apoc. Bar. 56:12–16 </p>
<p>the angels’ fall is related explicitly to eshly lust and in Origen26 the fall is attributed to </p>
<p>pride, in Jude it is a fall from authority, domain and position.”</p>
