<p>understanding that they are putting themselves in a precarious position </p>
<p>and thus must exercise every caution possible. </p>
<p>ey should not think of themselves are invulnerable. ey have to </p>
<p>attempt the saving with mercy while at the same time hating (miseō) the </p>
<p>deled clothing hanging on [the] esh (sarx—representing the sin) of </p>
<p>those wavering.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>e image here is one where the wavering persons are so</p>
<p>corrupted by the inltrators’ teachings that every aspect of their live, repre-</p>
<p>sented by the imagery of the inner clothing (kitona means undergarments </p>
<p>worn next to the body (esh)), and whose soiling then would emanate </p>
<p>from the body itself) is so stained that it can stain whoever is handling it. </p>
<p>Reference to esh here also has to be understood in light of the Pau-</p>
<p>line distinction between “sinful nature” (esh—Rom 7:18, 25; Gal 5:13, 24; </p>
<p>Col 2:23) and “godly nature” (spirit—Gal 5:16–18) which also aligns with </p>
<p>its use in vv. 7–8 concerning the sinful acts of the angels.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>What is called</p>
for then is a balance between mercy (a measure of divine mercy shown to
<p>the community, v. 1) and hatred of sin—loving the sinner and hating the </p>
<p>sin. Abundant caution is what the author calls for when dealing with the </p>
<p>ensnared ones, since there is always the danger of being ensnared.</p>
<p>Conclusion and Benediction (v. 24)</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Now, for the one able to guard you without stumbling, and cause </p>
<p>you to stand before the face of judgment itself, without blemish, </p>
<p>and in extreme gladness, to the only God our savior, through Jesus </p>
<p>Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and all authority for </p>
<p>all time now and forever more, amen.</p>

<p>is benediction is perhaps the best-known segment of Jude, recited oen </p>
<p>at the close of church services. While Jude is clearly an epistle in the Hel-</p>
<p>lenistic epistolary convention, this benediction seems well suited to oral </p>
<p>performance, and no wonder it is the most popular part of the letter.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>Jude began the epistle with the assurance to his audience that they are </p>
<p>kept in Christ Jesus (v. 1), and now he rounds up the epistle with a similar </p>

<p>111. See Metzger (1994: 661) who points out that some manuscripts omitted “for </p>
<p>all time and forever” because they may have thought such a phrase does not belong in a </p>
<p>doxology. However, many manuscripts () A B C L vg syr</p>
<p>h</p>
<p>, etc.) included it.</p>

<p>letters were meant to be read out loud to the original recipients.</p>
