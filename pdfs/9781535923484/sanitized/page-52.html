<p>Jude 3–4</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>his concern for their struggles in relationship to the shared Christian faith. </p>
<p>He is under conviction of the gravity of the situation that he feels obligated </p>
<p>to write a letter that in essence pronounces warfare against those who he </p>
<p>believes to be active enemies presently assailing the community of Chris-</p>
<p>tians.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>It would seem to be the case that the community is struggling in</p>
<p>regards to faith, perhaps, due to persecution. e sense of urgency that the </p>
<p>author announces in v. 3, by pointing out how this letter is a product of </p>
<p>a compulsion and earnestness, points to a scenario where the readers are </p>
<p>nding it dicult to maintain their faith in Jesus Christ, and maybe ques-</p>
<p>tioning their place in the larger community of believers. </p>
<p>Like any conict, there are casualties expected and so the urgency to </p>
<p>struggle is with the awareness that something has to be done, and there is </p>
<p>no choice about getting involved. What they contend for is described as </p>
<p>that which was received by the saints, once and for all. If those from whom </p>
<p>they received it had not guarded it, then there may have been nothing to </p>
<p>inherit. </p>
<p>For this reason, the readers have to exert eort to protect the pre-</p>
<p>cious gi that they have received. is suggests that there is an identiable </p>
<p>body of normative, authentic and authoritative teaching to which Jude </p>
<p>refers, which was inherited and now is entrusted, to the community for </p>
<p>“safe-keeping.” ey must not allow it to be in any way altered or damaged. </p>
<p>Not only was it a once-and-for-all exercise, which cannot be replicated, it </p>
<p>was also a once-and-for-all body of teaching, to which there can be no ac-</p>
<p>cretions or deletions. Anybody claiming otherwise is thus to be regarded </p>
<p>as deceptive and be treated as an enemy of truth. ese are the people who </p>
<p>are about to be revealed in the next verse as those who have inltrated the </p>
<p>community of Jude and brought with them a teaching other than the one </p>
<p>that was delivered to the community of the holy ones/saints, and is now </p>
<p>inherited by the community.</p>
<p>Arrival of Infiltrators (v. 4)</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>For some men have stealthily inltrated [among you], whose </p>
<p>judgment was long ago/before written about; ungodly, they who </p>
<p>instead of our God’s grace have preferred giving themselves over </p>
<p>into licentiousness and denied our only master and Lord, Jesus </p>
<p>Christ. </p>
<p>23. Ananke (“eagerness”)—urgent desire, to write to them need not indicate a quickly </p>
<p>written letter but reects common rhetoric in Greek letter openings (urén 1993: 456).</p>
