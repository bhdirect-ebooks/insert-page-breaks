<p>False-Teachers And eir Inevitable Judgment</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>appears in 2:3, 3:7, and 3:16, again with the subject being the false-teachers’ </p>
<p>fate of doom.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e multiple uses imply a strong conviction in the author’s mind con-</p>
<p>cerning the unchangeable fate of the false-teachers. ere is little doubt </p>
<p>in his mind of their ultimate end which they bring upon themselves by </p>
<p>virtue of their teachings—rejecting the authority of Jesus (and ultimately </p>
<p>God), the master who purchased them. is destruction that they bring </p>
<p>on themselves is going to happen suddenly and quickly (tachinos), mean-</p>
<p>ing they will have no time to change their minds. In essence, there will be </p>
<p>no warning about the judgment—it will be swi and comprehensive. It is a </p>
<p>total annihilation with no hope for recovery. </p>
<p>e phrase used to describe Jesus’ lordship in v. 1, is likely a compres-</p>
<p>sion from its source in Jude 4 who speaks of denying our only (monos) </p>
<p>master and Lord, Jesus Christ. It loses its direct political anti-Caesar punch </p>
<p>(see notes on 1:2, 17, 3:18) and focuses more on the idea of procurement of </p>
<p>a slave by a master. e word despotēs is used in both Jude and 2 Peter and </p>
<p>is translated as “master” or “lord.” It usually appears in the NT as a designa-</p>
<p>tion of a “one who has legal control and authority over persons, such as </p>
<p>subjects or slaves” (e.g., Luke 2:29; Acts 4:24; Rev 6:10).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here, Jesus is the master, on the same grounds that the author can de-</p>
<p>scribe himself, as a slave of Christ in 1:1, in submission to Christ’s author-</p>
<p>ity. In contrast, the false-teachers’ rejection of Jesus’ authority over their </p>
<p>lives, is evidenced by their failure to live up to the outlined virtues (1:5–7), </p>
<p>and in their own heretical teachings (hairesis) that contradict the virtues </p>
<p>and result in unbridled living (aselgeia). </p>
<p>Excursus: Aselgeia</p>
<p>As we have mentioned before, the stereotypical portrayals of licentiousness </p>
<p>(aselgeia) imply more than just the sexual aberration that the word is generally </p>
understood to mean, but includes an attitude of not recognizing divine author-
<p>ity, and moral codes in society, seeing no need for restraint, and instead, pen-</p>
<p>chant for excess. This ﬂies in the face of the very ethos that 2 Peter’s virtue </p>
<p>list in (1:5–7) outlines as the foundational elements that the community’s </p>
<p>5. Of the eighteen total appearances in the New Testament, ve are found in 2 Peter.</p>
