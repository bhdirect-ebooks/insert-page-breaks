<p>Stereotypical Characterization of False-Teachers</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>e comparison with wild beasts nds a slightly dierent meaning </p>
<p>if the focus is less on the slaughtering part and more with the fact that </p>
<p>they have placed themselves at the lowest level of life. During this period </p>
<p>of Greco-Roman history, philosophers had sought to distinguish humans </p>
<p>from the rest of the animal kingdom and they argued that it is largely their </p>
<p>ability to reason through speech, that makes humans humans, and distin-</p>
<p>guish them from animals.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Animals were presumed to be incapable of not only formulating vir-</p>
<p>tues, but they also could not live up to them even if they understood them. </p>
<p>Humans, on the other hand, are able to distinguish between aspects like </p>
<p>good and evil, justice and injustice, and therefore are not controlled by their </p>
<p>instinct, like the animals are. It is in this regard that Aristotle labels humans </p>
<p>as political animals (zoon politikon) which would stand in stark contrast </p>
<p>to 2 Peter’s characterization of the false-teachers as irrational beasts (aloga </p>
<p>zoa).</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If then, according to Aristotle, humans are the only animals (zoon) </p>
<p>that use language to articulate between that which is in any sense good or </p>
<p>evil, and to distinguish between justice and injustice, then 2 Peter’s charac-</p>
<p>terization of the false-teachers as irrational beasts (alogon zoon), worthy </p>
<p>only of slaughter (eis alosin kai phthoran), is to remove them completely </p>
<p>from the realm of that which is human. </p>
<p>It is this irrational nature of the false-teachers that is reected in </p>
<p>their ignorance (agnoeō) that results in blasphemy thus drawing, upon </p>
themselves, divine judgment. Since salvation for 2 Peter is on the basis of
<p>knowledge (gnosis) (1:5; 3:18), it is clear that their ignorance is not simply </p>
<p>lack of information, but rather a conscious eort on their part to reject </p>

<p>40. Aristotle, Pol., I.2.1252b line 27–1253a line 17. “Hence it is evident that the state </p>
<p>is a creation of nature, and that man is by nature a political animal [zoon politikon KB]. </p>
<p>And he who by nature and not by mere accident is without a state, is either a bad man </p>
<p>or above humanity; he is like the “Tribeless, lawless, heartless one, “whom Homer de-</p>
<p>nounces—the natural outcast is forthwith a lover of war; he may be compared to an iso-</p>
<p>lated piece at draughts. Now, that man is more of a political animal than bees or any other </p>
<p>gregarious animals, is evident. Nature, as we oen say, makes nothing in vain, and man is </p>
<p>the only animal whom she has endowed with the gi of speech. And whereas mere voice </p>
<p>is but an indication of pleasure or pain, and is therefore found in other animals (for their </p>
<p>nature attains to the perception of pleasure and pain and the intimation of them to one </p>
<p>another, and no further), the power of speech is intended to set forth the expedient and </p>
<p>inexpedient, and therefore likewise the just and the unjust. And it is a characteristic of </p>
<p>man that he alone has any sense of good and evil, of just and unjust, and the like, and the </p>
<p>association of living beings who have this sense makes a family and a state. </p>
