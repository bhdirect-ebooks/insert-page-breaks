<p>Jude 12–13</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>in the close connes of the intimate meals. Instead, this is more likely a </p>
<p>characterization of the general attitude they exhibit, with little fear of re-</p>
<p>crimination.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>at is where the notion of “wild” is evidenced—a failure to</p>
<p>regulate their behavior in accordance with given community guidelines. </p>
<p>It is with impunity that they carry themselves. erefore comparison to </p>
<p>uncaring shepherds recalls Ezekiel 34 where Israel’s leaders are accused of </p>
<p>being shepherds that eat the ock instead of taking care of it. </p>
<p>It is this comparison with shepherds of Israel that allows some com-</p>
<p>mentators to identify the inltrators as teachers, even though Jude never </p>
<p>identies them as such. It would seem then that these commentators </p>
<p>wrongfully fuse the image of the false-teachers (pseudodidaskaloi) of 2 Pe-</p>
<p>ter into this metaphor to identify Jude’s inltrators as teachers, even though </p>
<p>Jude never calls them teachers—false or otherwise.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jude then continues his metaphors describing the inltrators with </p>
<p>four more images that derive from elements of nature—clouds with no </p>
<p>rain (air), trees with no fruit (land), sea full of foam (water) and wan-</p>
<p>dering stars (heavens) to continue his descriptions.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>Faith in the Bible is</p>
<p>usually analogous to rootedness and stability (e.g., Psalm 1—tree planted </p>
<p>by the waters) while wickedness is characterized as the inability to settle </p>
<p>Sir 5:9–10; Eph 4:14; 2 Pet 2:14; Jas 1:6), and this provides that background </p>
<p>for the tree metaphor in Jude. Almost identical language is found in Isa </p>
<p>57:20–21, describing the wicked: “But the wicked are like the tossing sea </p>
<p>that cannot keep still; its waters toss up mire and mud.ere is no peace, says </p>
<p>my God, for the wicked.” </p>
<p>e danger these inltrators pose, is that they move from one place </p>
<p>to another—whether physically or theologically, it is unclear—and they do </p>
<p>not seem to have the capacity to hold fast to the group’s teachings. Instead, </p>
<p>they are subject to any passing fad. Similar concern and language is reect-</p>
<p>ed in Eph 4:14–15, where the author implores unity to his audience: “As a </p>
<p>result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and </p>
<p>carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by crainess </p>
<p>in deceitful scheming . . .” e phrase untamed or wild (agria) waves, also </p>
<p>retains the image of out of control state of the inltrators that is reected </p>
<p>in their comparison to irrational brutes in v. 10. Allusion to 1 Enoch 80 is </p>
<p>also possible here. is inability to be contained (or to contain one-self) </p>
