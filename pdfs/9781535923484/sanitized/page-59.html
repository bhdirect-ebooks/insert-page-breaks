<p>ree Examples of Divine Judgment of Ancient Israel, as Warnings</p>

<p>“fallen angels.” is forms a better background for Jude’s statement. ey </p>
<p>broke the regulations of staying within specied heavenly boarders, and </p>
instead transgressed, and trespassed, the appointed divine limitations. And
<p>so, like those arrested on the wrong side of the fence, they are detained </p>
<p>awaiting judgment. e home that they forsook is not identied here. How-</p>
<p>ever, Jude’s later use of 1 Enoch 6–16 allows us to presume their home is the </p>
<p>one referred to in 1 Enoch 6:2 (ouranos—heaven). However, unlike 1 Enoch </p>
<p>which simply reports that they “descended” from heaven, Jude makes it </p>
<p>clear that they are heavenly beings who forsook (apolipontas) their heav-</p>
enly abode and thus transgressed divine boundaries.

In essence, he is implying that the divine beings (angels), who may
<p>have an even greater status than humans before God, when it came to </p>
judgment, even they were not spared. And, if this happened to the divine
<p>beings, there is little hope for humans who deliberately reject the truth, as </p>
<p>the author perceives it, and mislead others to do the same. Such reasoning </p>
<p>is derived from the exegesis principle of qal va-homer (arguing from the </p>
greater to the lesser). “If angels were not spared divine judgment for their
<p>fault, do you—mere humans—think you could escape?” </p>
<p>One could not paint a direr scenario of the consequences, their in-</p>
evitability and inescapability. e divine beings forsook their home, their
<p>rightful domicile and the presence of God, much in the same way that the </p>
<p>inltrators are departing from their true home—union with God through </p>
Jesus Christ—and are inviting upon themselves divine judgment. e verb
<p>tereō (to keep, to preserve) is used twice in the sentence, and contrasts with </p>
<p>its use later in v. 21 where it is used in reference to those being kept safe by </p>
God, awaiting divine mercy. Here, however, the reference is to the angels
<p>who did not carefully “keep” themselves within their given boundaries and </p>
<p>are therefore being kept (or more accurately, are being guarded or in cus-</p>
tody) awaiting nal divine judgment.
<p>46</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Judgment, therefore, is the immediate context for both vv. 6 and 21. </p>
<p>For the angels, it is an act of being detained for a negative outcome that is </p>
<p>already predetermined. Similarly, in v. 21, the believers are kept or guarded </p>
<p>also with a predetermined future in mind; however, for them it is positive </p>
—divine mercy and eternal blessing.
<p>e reference here to judgment day, though rare in NT, may be draw-</p>
<p>ing from the HB/OT’s expression the “day of the Lord” understood as the </p>
<p>45. Cf. Charles 2005: 40–44.</p>
<p>46. e detention of angelic beings is also referenced in apocalyptic writings such as </p>
<p>2 Apoc. Bar. 56: 13; Jub. 5:10; and Rev 18:2; 20:7.</p>
