<p>Examples of Past Divine Judgments and Rescues</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>e logic behind such reasoning would be that since, like Noah, Lot was </p>
divinely rescued from judgment on a sinful community, then he must be
<p>righteous (2:9). </p>
<p>However, the image we have of Lot in Genesis makes his candidacy </p>
<p>for entitlement of a righteous man rather questionable, to say the least! His </p>
<p>preference for the cities, in contrast to Abraham’s choice of the country, </p>
<p>seems to indicate a tradition that makes Lot seem greedy (Gen 13:10–13); </p>
<p>his attempt to give his daughters to be raped by the men in Sodom in order </p>
<p>to save strangers, leaves the impression of an extremely callous father (Gen </p>
<p>19:8); his hesitation to ee Sodom indicates lack of faith (Gen 19:16); and, </p>
<p>his drunkenness and his eventual incest with his own daughters, make him </p>
<p>out to be a disgrace (Gen 19:33–35). In contrast though, it was Lot who </p>
<p>took in the strangers into his home showing hospitality (Gen 19:1–4), and </p>
<p>he attempted, no matter how awkwardly, to protect them from the sinful </p>
<p>men of Sodom (Gen 19:6–10). </p>
<p>As it turns out, however, the Second Temple period Jewish literature </p>
<p>virtually rehabilitated Lot and presented him as virtuous (arête). In the </p>
<p>Wisdom of Solomon (Gen 10:1–13), for example, Lot is listed together with </p>
<p>Noah, Abraham, Jacob and Joseph as a “virtuous man,” and he is rescued </p>
<p>(errusato) by Wisdom, much in the same way that God rescues (errusato) </p>
<p>him in 2 Peter 2:7. Similarly, for Philo (Vit. Mos. 57–59), it is a “virtuous </p>
<p>man” (Lot) who is rescued from destruction of Sodom and Gomorra. Jose-</p>
<p>phus’ retelling of the Lot stories presents him as a “generous and hospitable </p>
<p>man,” attributes he had learned from his uncle Abraham and which earned </p>
<p>him the honor of being listed in the ancestry to the David.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>In similar</p>
<p>fashion, Midrashic writings point to Lot’s hospitality as a basis for his com-</p>
<p>mendation and piety—Gen. Rab. 49:13 and Pirqe R. El. 25 (see also 1 Clem </p>
<p>11:1).</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While all these Jewish writings certainly provide a plausible way of </p>
<p>looking at the rehabilitation of Lot, it is still rather dicult to comprehend </p>
<p>the description of him in 2 Peter as tortured (basanitzō) by the sinfulness </p>
<p>of the city of Sodom given he willingly settled among them (Gen 13:10). </p>
<p>e reading of basanitzō as psychological oppression has been contested </p>
<p>since its appearances elsewhere suggest torment associated with torture </p>
<p>(e.g., Rev 9:5; 14:11; 18:10, 15).</p>
