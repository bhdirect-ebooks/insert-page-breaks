<p>2 PETER 1</p>
<p>Salutations and Bestowing of Honor on Readers (1:1–2)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Simeon Peter, slave and apostle of Jesus Christ. To those equally </p>
<p>honored with us to receive the faith in righteousness of our God </p>
<p>and savior, Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Grace and peace be multiplied to you by/</p>
<p>through the knowledge of God and of our Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>e rst chapter of the 2 Peter outlines the author’s desire for the commu-</p>
<p>nity to be built up through adherence to certain ethical practices (1:4–7), </p>
positioning them not as human injunctions, but as divinely inspired in-
<p>structions for godly living. ese, he argues have arrived at the communi-</p>
<p>ty’s doorstep via an unbroken chain of reliable human messengers, having </p>
had their divine origin which gives them their divine authority. God passed
<p>these on to Jesus, who in turn gave them to the apostles and the apostles </p>
<p>faithfully relayed them to the author to communicate them to the commu-</p>
<p>nity, with the common thread that connects them all being the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p>Employing rhetorical persuasion, the author incrementally builds his argu-</p>
<p>ment structuring it as a well organized refutation of what he identies as </p>
<p>enemies’ fables that have misled the community.</p>
<p>is is a standard letter introduction in Greco-Roman antiquity, with </p>
<p>author’s name rst followed by recipients. e author identies himself </p>
<p>here with the name Simeon Peter, a name used in the gospels for one of the </p>
<p>disciple of Jesus (Mark 1:16–30). According to the Gospels, Jesus gave him </p>
<p>the name Peter (Aramaic equivalent Cephas) meaning “rock,”(Matt 16:17) </p>
<p>and establishes him as a leader of the early church (Acts 4, 5, 8, 9, 15). e </p>
<p>spelling of the name here is rare; Sumeon which is a transliterated Semitic </p>
<p>name and which only appears once elsewhere in the NT as Peter’s name, in </p>
<p>Acts 15:14.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. Its appearance in Rev 7:7 is in reference to the tribe of Simeon. e more common </p>
<p>transliteration of Simon was also one of the most common Hellenized Semitic names.</p>
