<p>2 PETER 2</p>
<p>Aer setting up what he considers the foundation of reliable prophetic </p>
<p>characterization in chapter 1, the author of 2 Peter proceeds in the next </p>
<p>chapter to contrast that image with that of the false-teachers (pseudodi-</p>
<p>daskaloi) who he now characterizes as bearing similarities to the false-</p>
<p>prophets (pseudoprophētai) of old (2:1) in their perdiousness. e </p>
<p>dependability of the eyewitness, the assuredness of the presence of God’s </p>
<p>spirit in the message of the true prophets and the assuredness of Scripture, </p>
<p>are all contrasted with the deceitful teachings, immoral lifestyle, and ethical </p>
<p>out-of-control-ness, and deceptive ways of the false-teachers. e former </p>
<p>are reliable while the latter only mislead, and inevitably lead to destruction, </p>
<p>to eternal damnation. </p>
<p>e rhetoric employed casts the false-teachers as the direct opposite of </p>
<p>the true prophets (inclusive of the author), portraying them as dangerous in </p>
<p>their deceptive teachings, immoral in their character, and arrogantly reject-</p>
ing divine authority embodied in Jesus. e rhetoric employs stereotypi-
<p>cal language common in Greco-Roman group identity conicts to further </p>
<p>present the false-teachers as ungodly, sexual deviant, murderers and ethi-</p>
<p>cally immoral.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>ey are thus variously characterized as debased, driven by</p>
<p>wild–animal–like instincts, and completely lacking in self-control, com-</p>
<p>mon human civility and morality (cf. 2 Pet 2:2–3; 12–13). </p>
<p>In 2 Pet 2:15, the author accuses the false-teachers of abandoning the </p>
<p>“straight path,” and meaning they formally belonged with the group but are </p>
<p>now nding that their views are in conict. ey have lost their place in the </p>
<p>community and they try to draw others out with them (3:14b).</p>

<p>But also false-prophets arose among the people, just as among </p>
<p>you there will arise false-teachers who will bring in along with </p>
<p>them destructive teachings and they would deny the master who </p>
