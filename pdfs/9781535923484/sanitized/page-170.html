<p>2 Peter 3:11–16</p>
<p>150</p>
<p>Secondly, this exhortation to cultic cleanness that makes one worthy </p>
<p>of acceptance by God parallels the classication of sacricial animals as </p>
<p>spotless and without blemish (Exod 12:5; 29:1; Lev 1:3, 10; Num 6:14). </p>
<p>Acceptance before God of the ancient animal sacrices was premised on </p>
<p>this criteria of spotlessness and cleanness, and that remains the same crite-</p>
<p>rion for acceptance of the Petrine community before God. However, while </p>
<p>the understanding in the Hebrew Bible was generally a literate application </p>
<p>of this phrase to the sacricial animals, in 2 Peter it becomes a metaphor for </p>
<p>spiritual and moral uprightness before God. </p>
<p>Similar cultic language is applied to the church in Eph 5:27, Phil 2:15, </p>
<p>Heb 9:14, and to Christ in 1 Pet 1:19. In Jude’s benediction the author com-</p>
<p>mits the church to the God who is able to make it stand without blemish (v. </p>
<p>24), while 2 Peter urges the church to strive to be found in the state of spot-</p>
<p>lessness and blamelessness. Considering that everything will be exposed on </p>
<p>the Day of the Lord (3:10), the church then ought to be found in a spotless </p>
<p>and blameless state. </p>
<p>Twice before, the author has used the same phrase—to make every </p>
<p>eort: the rst in 1:10 is in light of the issue of calling and elections, which </p>
<p>he urges the readers to “make every eort,” to conrm. e second instance </p>
<p>he is the primary subject committing himself to “make every eort” to re-</p>
<p>mind the community of the teachings he has imparted, even as he expect </p>
<p>soon to depart from them permanently (1:15). In both instances, just as </p>
<p>it is in this case, the focus is on the need to keep virtues that beget the </p>
<p>metaphorical “sacricial purity,” in the eyes of God. And it is in that spirit </p>
<p>that he will continue in verse 17, the injunction to the community to be on </p>
<p>guard against error of lawlessness. </p>
<p>Being found spotless and blameless makes sense, especially as a meta-</p>
<p>phor to godliness, in 2 Peter’s terminology. However, it is unclear why he </p>
<p>includes the idea of being found in peace (hēirene) in verse 14. While the </p>
<p>patience of our Lord can be understood in light of verse 9, where God’s </p>
<p>longsuering is for the sake of salvation, it is not clear what the object of </p>
<p>peace is here. If it is God, then it would be translated as being “at peace </p>
<p>with God” (NIV). On the other hand, if is understood as a supplement </p>
<p>of spotless and blameless, then focus would be on the community and the </p>
<p>translation would be, “found at peace, without spot or blemish” (ASV, </p>
<p>KJV).</p>
<p>ere is, however, no reason to believe that there was an ongoing un-</p>
<p>ease or upheaval in the community in spite of the highlighted activities </p>
