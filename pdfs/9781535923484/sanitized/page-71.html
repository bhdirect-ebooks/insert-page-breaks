<p>Nature of Inltrators as Bringers of False Hope</p>

on the outside. e spillas (morally wrecking individuals) can then be in
<p>line with the epithumia (lust, uncontrolled passions) in v. 16, who, due to </p>
<p>their overriding lack of self-control, succumb to their lustful desires. </p>
<p>Jude’s complaint is analogous to that made by Philo concerning Ro-</p>
<p>man aer-dinner-banqueting (Philo, Cont. 6.48–54)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>79</p>
<p>which, though not</p>
<p>concerned with inltration, is nevertheless, focused on the opinion within </p>
<p>his Jewish audience concerning the acceptability of what he deems as mor-</p>
<p>ally reprehensible behaviors prevalent in Greco-Roman gatherings.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>As</p>
<p>Harland warns, such characterizations have to be taken with a pinch of salt, </p>
<p>given their one-sided, polemic-driven rhetoric.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>is trope of sexual deviance and comparison to animal instinct, </p>
<p>once again, appeals more to a stereotyping of the inltrators than it would </p>
<p>as a reliable historical description of their character or moral aberrance. </p>
<p>Such an understanding nds support in the characterization that Jude em-</p>
<p>ploys in next three verses to describe the inltrators. Not only are these </p>
<p>stereotypical, he also utilizes metaphors whose literal understanding is not </p>
<p>sucient to reconstitute, with any certainty, the historical veracity of the </p>
<p>inltrators. </p>
<p>e idea of fearlessness (aphobōs) in the “fearlessness, shepherds/</p>
<p>feeding themselves” is not a positive one, say, in the way that a brave sol-</p>
<p>dier in war would show fearlessness. Rather, it is with impunity that the </p>
<p>inltrators exhibit an astounding lack of shame that evidences in their un-</p>
<p>abashedness in the face of wrongdoing, and marks them as lacking basic </p>
<p>moral judgment. Not only a disregard of the etiquette of these love feast </p>
<p>gatherings, but their daring uninhibited behavior which shows lack of at-</p>
<p>tentiveness to implications for their actions. </p>
<p>And, for a society governed by honor and shame, no greater public ac-</p>
<p>cusation could be made against someone than that he/she has no honor!</p>
<p>82</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is is the accusation leveled against the inltrators by Jude. It is unlikely, </p>
<p>however, that they exhibited their abandon to immorality during the love </p>
<p>feasts since this would obviously expose them out immediately to the group </p>
<p>79. “Some perhaps may approve the method of banqueting now prevalent every-</p>
<p>where through hankering for the Italian expensiveness and luxury emulated both by </p>
<p>Greeks and non-Greeks who make their arrangements for ostentation rather than festiv-</p>
<p>ity. . . e last tables brought in are reserved for the drinking bouts and the aer-dinners </p>
<p>as they call them.”</p>
