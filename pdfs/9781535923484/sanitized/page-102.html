<p>2 Peter 1:5–11</p>

<p>Unfruitfulness here may have the eschatological implication of loss </p>
<p>of salvation, in the same way the unfruitful trees in the gospels are up-</p>
<p>rooted or chopped o (Matt 3:10; 12:33; 21:19–21; Mark 11:13–21; Luke </p>
<p>3:9; 6:43; 13: 6–7). erefore, the unfruitfulness in v. 8 is not simply a sense </p>
<p>of unproductivity, but a more dire situation where the failure to produce </p>
<p>fruit is an indication of the internal spiritual deadness that would result in </p>
<p>judgment. It seems to recall the enacted parable of Jesus with the gure tree </p>
<p>which he cursed when he found it to have no fruit in its due season (Matt </p>
<p>21:19–21; Mark 11:13–20) and it withered. </p>
<p>is eschatological dimension is further engrained by the warning </p>
<p>that follows in v. 9: the readers are to bear evidence of their exalted state, as </p>
<p>those privileged to be called and elected, of God (v. 10). is language of </p>
<p>election reminds them that the virtues are to be a response to God’s grace </p>
<p>(v. 2) and not a means of archiving any standing before God. It is princi-</p>
<p>pally because they are called and chosen, that the virtues must govern their </p>
<p>behavior. And, since they now belong, they need to reect that in how they </p>
<p>live their lives. </p>
<p>erefore, the lack of two elements of comprehension, sight (blind) </p>
<p>and memory (forgetful), v. 9, characterize one who is decient in the vir-</p>
<p>tues outlined above. Blindness and forgetfulness indicate an absence of dis-</p>
<p>cernment concerning the signicance of the cleansing of sin, which would </p>
<p>warrant a complete transformation of one’s behavior. ey already know </p>
<p>(1:12) but they fail to act upon it. It is not total absence of something but </p>
<p>a faulty or unclear comprehension. It is interesting that virtues, otherwise </p>
<p>highlighted as the epitome of religious practice in Greco-Roman religion, </p>
<p>are listed here serving only as a measure of spirituality and not as the end. </p>
<p>Of course, the idea of blindness here is understood metaphorically </p>
<p>as reference to behavior rather than physical malady—the person who </p>
<p>fails to have the virtues previously outlined, can be characterized as blind, </p>
<p>unable to see where they are going or what they are doing. If the virtues </p>
<p>characterize the called and chosen, then those who do not evidence them </p>
<p>are so nearsighted as to be blind. Blindness is usually used in the NT to </p>
<p>characterize inability to comprehend the teachings of the gospel message </p>
<p>(Matt 12:22; 15:14; 23:16–19; 23:26; Luke 4:18; John 9:39; 2 Cor 4:4; Rom </p>
2:19; 11:8; Eph 4:18; 1 John 2:11; Rev 3:17) putting one in danger of divine
<p>judgment. e implications seem to be the same here. Any that fails to ex-</p>
<p>emplify the virtues listed is still blind and has failed to fully grasp what it </p>
<p>means to have one’s sins forgiven. is is apostasy, where one who initially </p>
