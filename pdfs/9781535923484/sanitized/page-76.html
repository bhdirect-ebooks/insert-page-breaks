<p>to the community gatherings (v. 12; cf. v. 19). As a collective, the behav-</p>
<p>ioral patterns attributed to them by Jude represent the type of conduct that </p>
<p>would have resulted in being kicked out of any association. </p>
<p>e attitude of self-interest and self-promotion that prevails among </p>
<p>them, serves only to make them appear better than they actually are. Jude </p>
<p>sees in them an ungrateful, dissatised, self-seeking, deceitful and arro-</p>
<p>gant group, whose claims about anything cannot be trusted at all. To him, </p>
<p>everything they say is either wildly exaggerated or totally unfounded. Jude </p>
<p>describes their speeches as huperongka, a word found in the writings of </p>
<p>Philo, Josephus, and in the LXX (Septuagint—Greek translation of HB/OT) </p>
<p>where the general meaning is excess in terms of size, attitude or personal-</p>
<p>ity. at is why translators of Jude have chosen words such as haughty, </p>
<p>pompous, or bombastic to describe huperongka</p>
<p>. </p>
<p>95</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Conceit abounds in their attitude, blinding them to their own falsied </p>
<p>self-perception! eir intent is obvious, according to Jude; they want to </p>
<p>impress themselves in the eyes of the community and thus gain admiration </p>
<p>and respect, all along driven by self-deception. In contrast to the words </p>
<p>(rhemata) spoken by the apostles, which are reliable (v. 17), the words of </p>
<p>these inltrators are lled with hot air (huperongkos)—“words with no </p>
<p>trustworthiness” or “words that carry no truth.” Riddled with falsehood, </p>
<p>they fail to deliver what they promise since such claims cannot be backed </p>
<p>up by their actions.</p>
<p>Warning About Scoffers (vv. 17–19)</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>But you, beloved, remember the words spoken before by the </p>
<p>apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>for they used say to you, </p>
<p>“In the last days there will scoers, following aer their own evil </p>
<p>desires and godlessness.” </p>
<p>19</p>
ese are those who are causing divi-
<p>sions [among you], brutes of nature, having no spirit [of God]. </p>
<p>Turning his focus to his audience, Jude makes a striking contrast with those </p>
<p>previously described in v. 16. While the latter speak pompous words, the </p>
<p>community is encouraged rather to remember the words (remata) of Jesus’ </p>
<p>apostles.</p>
<p>“But you . . .” repeated also in v. 20, sets up a pattern of A B A’ B’, </p>
<p>where Jude addresses the dangers posed by the inltrators in A A’ and </p>
<p>strongly contrasts it with the caution to his audience B B’, to exemplify a </p>
