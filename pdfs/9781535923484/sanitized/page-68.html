<p>sense of empathy, sympathy, and disappointment with the addressees. It </p>
<p>also reects the author’s eschatological expectation of the imminence of </p>
<p>judgment—an expectation of the inevitably approaching judgment, which </p>
<p>would have otherwise been avoided, if only the addressees had paid atten-</p>
<p>tion to prior warnings! All they needed to do was to see the bad endings of </p>
<p>the examples cited from Scripture. What a pity!</p>
<p>Jude, by going back to the HB/OT for examples that should stand as </p>
<p>warnings for the inltrators, makes it clear that their path is one that leads </p>
<p>to an inevitable damnation. All three HB/OT characters given as examples </p>
<p>were judged by God for their actions—Cain murdered his brother Abel and </p>
<p>was banished to wander forever (Gen 4:1–14) and in later Jewish tradition </p>
<p>came to epitomize the archetype of ungodliness.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>Balaam tried to curse</p>
<p>Israel, but was subsequently killed by Israel (Num 31:8) and in later Jewish </p>
<p>tradition came to typify selsh greed, deception and pride.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>Korah led a</p>
<p>rebellion against Moses in the wilderness and was swallowed alive by the </p>
<p>earth (Num 16:1–35) and in later Jewish tradition came to be aligned with </p>
<p>the men of Sodom as those that would never make it to the world to come.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over time, these three came to represent classic examples of rebel-</p>
lion against divine ordinance in the Second Temple Jewish tradition, where
<p>they all represent those who “taught evil to others and they were punished” </p>
<p>for it.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>eir punishment parallels the eternal destruction that befell those</p>
<p>who le Egypt but were destroyed in the wilderness (v. 5). It is this inescap-</p>
<p>able judgment that the inltrators are courting, according to Jude. ere is </p>
no escaping such nal and comprehensive divine destruction. at is why
<p>the inltrators are following the path or way of the three. e metaphor </p>
<p>captures the direction that their choices are leading them to—a path to </p>
<p>eternal destruction. e same basic spirit of rebellion and deception said </p>
<p>to have characterized the triumvirate of wickedness Cain, Balaam and Ko-</p>
<p>rah, now characterizes the inltrators. </p>
