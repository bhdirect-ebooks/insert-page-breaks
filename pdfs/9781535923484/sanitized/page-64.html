<p>Jude 3–4</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>So, rather than it simply being a swipe at their wishful thinking, Jude </p>
<p>levies accusations against these inltrators for adherence to the dream </p>
<p>interpreters’ traditions or teachings, with their lopsided beliefs in such is-</p>
<p>sues as sexual deviance in dreams. For example, Artemidorus’ Dream In-</p>
<p>terpretations 1:45, elaborates on the dierent metaphorical interpretations </p>
<p>of the penis vis á vis family members, while in 1:76 he makes an extensive </p>
<p>discussion on what it means to have intercourse with one’s mother in a </p>
<p>dream. is may put in some context Jude’s connection of the inltrators </p>
<p>with sexual deviance, when he accuses them of deling themselves. </p>
<p>In opposition to the inltrators, based on what Jude sees as conduct </p>
<p>unbecoming of those who identify with the Christian community, any </p>
claim to divine origin by the dreamers is seen as misplaced. What they do is not to honor God but instead to reject divine authority and consequently
<p>blaspheme against God’s representatives. at is why the following contrast </p>
<p>in verse ten zeroes in on the fact that their actions reect a rejection of the </p>
<p>lordship of God and result in blaspheming of angels. </p>
As it were, if indeed these dreams were divine revelations, these inl-
<p>trators would neither reject the lordship of Jesus nor blaspheme against </p>
<p>Go d’s glorious ones, since they would know better. It is an accusation of </p>
a misplaced dangerous claim to divine authority by the inltrators which,
<p>according to Jude, results in rejection of the very faith they may be claim-</p>
ing to represent. Like the false prophets in the HB/OT who claimed divine
<p>revelation from dreams while they failed to speak the truth (Jer 23:15) so </p>
<p>do these dreamers.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>We are not told exactly what they do in deling their bodies. How-</p>
<p>ever, the language of deling (miainō) the esh seems to assume that the </p>
<p>sexual conduct discussed in v. 7, may give a broader context of their actions. </p>
<p>When the term miainō occurs in other parts of the NT, it is usually con-</p>
<p>nected to cultic elements, e.g., John 18:28: Titus 1:5; Heb 7:6, 12:15, 13:4; </p>
<p>Jas 1:27; 1 Pet 1: 4. (cf. G. Green, 2008, 75, on sexual sin and ceremonial </p>
<p>pollution) and their potential for pollution. So, the delement language </p>
<p>in Jude likely draws from such ceremonial uncleanness, of which sexual </p>
<p>impurity is common. </p>
<p>is notion is strengthened by the second part of the sentence, which </p>
<p>refers to the other spectrum of the inltrator’s fault, blaspheming against </p>
<p>glorious ones (understood to be angels from the following verse, v. 9). Pos-</p>
<p>sibly led by their own understanding of dreams, these inltrators may claim </p>
<p>a certain authority that they can appeal to as a justication of acts which </p>
