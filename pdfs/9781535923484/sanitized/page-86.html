<p>Fusing the Horizons: Preaching From Jude</p>

<p>ticated, and ﬁts well within the classical Greco-Roman rhetorical structures.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>And if the viliﬁcation, usually perceived negatively by most modern readers, </p>
<p>is simply part of conventional diatribe in public discourse understood by all </p>
<p>parties, then perhaps it is we who need to adopt to Jude’s rhetoric, or at least, </p>
<p>come to terms with it as a veritable ﬁrst century form of public discourse.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>On the reverse, Jude presents his target audience in very positive terms, </p>
<p>which implies that his intent in stereotyping the opponents is to distinguish </p>
<p>very clearly between his readers and his opponents. This, in and of itself, </p>
<p>may also reﬂect a stylistic aspect of his rhetoric of persuasion. As Joubert </p>
<p>explains, “[t]he ancient rhetoricians referred to this technique of estrang-</p>
<p>ing one’s opponents from the audience, by presenting them as negatively as </p>
<p>possible, as vituperatio.”</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>A skilled rhetorician is able to weave the praise</p>
<p>of his recipients while vilifying opponents as a weapon of persuasion.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>important thing is that, in the ancient world, all parties would be well aware </p>
<p>of this rhetorical device and the role that exaggeration and hyperbole plays in </p>
<p>a bid to draw pronounced difference between the groups, aware that Jude’s </p>
<p>main aim is to thoroughly dissuade his audience from being inﬂuenced by the </p>
<p>opponents, accused of inﬁltration. </p>
<p>If we get stuck on the ethics of it, then we fail to see the clear structural </p>
<p>binaries that control this discourse, which seek to draw a very clear demarca-</p>
<p>tion between the author’s audience and the perceived opponents.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>On the</p>
<p>other hand, this does not mean excusing some of the signiﬁcant dangers of ex-</p>
<p>treme stereotyping as evidenced in such horrendous situations as the Rwanda </p>
<p>genocide of 1994, where the language of hate was entwined in stereotypes of </p>
<p>the Tutsi minority by the Hutu majority to lead to the death of about a million </p>
<p>people. </p>
<p>Reading Jude in the African context, where the African has been the </p>
<p>victim of European racism and stereotyping raises a signiﬁcant concern and </p>
<p>problematizes the very language Jude uses. The violence meted on the African </p>
<p>peoples via slavery and colonialism was partly driven by the western caricature </p>
<p>and stereotyping of the African person as “uncivilized,” “unreligious” and </p>
<p>even less that human. Even the case of the Rwandan genocide is partly a </p>
