<p>Jude 12–13</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>could reach the most committed of the community, allowing their teaching </p>
<p>to spread faster. </p>
<p>If, as I suppose, the Christian communities organized themselves in </p>
<p>much the same way Greco-Roman voluntary associations did, then virtu-</p>
<p>ally everyone in the group knew everyone else and there were regulations </p>
<p>on who came to the gatherings.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>On the one hand, this does not preclude</p>
<p>the possibility that these inltrators are coming in pretending to be con-</p>
<p>verts, and then somehow managing to bring their brand of teachings to </p>
<p>the group, the traditional assumption of commentators on this text. Or else </p>
<p>they are former members of the group now returning and are welcomed, </p>
<p>but bring with them the corrupt teachings. </p>
<p>If both Jewish and Greco-Roman guilds and associations regulated </p>
<p>who came into their banquets, it makes sense to assume that the Christian </p>
<p>groups were doing the same. On the other hand, however, looking at the </p>
<p>regulations of how minority associations worked in Greco-Roman society, </p>
<p>these inltrators in Jude would have made it into the community feasts if </p>
<p>in the rst place they were not totally unknown to the community.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>is is</p>
<p>not to say that it was not possible since Christian outreach and hospitality </p>
<p>would have necessitated the welcome of the outsider. </p>
<p>What is hidden is not their identity but their intent and teachings.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e word spillas (stain, storm, rocks) is, perhaps, best transla<span class="_ _3" />ted as <span class="ff3 ls69 ws12e">hidden </span></p>
<p>rocks in the manner of dangerous rocks hidden near seashores that pause </p>
<p>unseen dangers to vessels.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>Inevitably, one wonders, if these were actual</p>
<p>inltrators coming from outside or, just like the stereotypical language the </p>
<p>author has used to caricature them above, these hidden rocks (spillas) are </p>
<p>simply a part of the community (or returning former members) whose </p>
<p>teachings the author disagrees with, and so seeks to expose.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, it is important to note that the rst interpreter of Jude, 2 </p>
<p>Pet 2:13, seems to understand its use in light of its moral meaning when he </p>
<p>changes spilades to spoloi (moral spots or defects). In the process of seek-</p>
<p>ing to oust them, the language of the inltrator then works, not simply to </p>
<p>show that they are coming from outside, but for Jude, they rightfully belong </p>
