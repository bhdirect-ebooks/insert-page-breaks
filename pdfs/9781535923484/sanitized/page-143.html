<p>Stereotypical Characterization of False-Teachers</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>e description of the false-teachers and their followers as blots (spi-</p>
<p>los) and blemishes (mōmos) (2:13) is in obvious contrast to the Petrine </p>
<p>community who are urged to strive to be spotless and blameless (aspiloi </p>
<p>kai amōmētoi) in 3:14, as they hasten the return of the Lord for the nal </p>
<p>judgment. Read in light of v. 12, these elements, whose antonyms are at-</p>
<p>tributed to the false-teachers (2:13) represent the unclean animals much in </p>
<p>the same say that the author’s audience represents the acceptable and un-</p>
<p>blemished animal sacrices (Lev 1:3; 22:20; Num 29:8; Deut 15:21; 17:1). </p>
<p>e same vocabulary is used of Jesus in 1 Peter 1:19, who is described as </p>
<p>the spotless (aspilos) lamb of God, in the manner of the Passover lamb that </p>
<p>cleanses sin. While, in Jude 24, it is Jesus who is able to present us before </p>
<p>God’s judgment, without any blemish (amomos). </p>
<p>An alternative reading of the text may also imply the reference to </p>
<p>the feast as a separate event from the public carousing that happens, in </p>
<p>which case the former is the community’s regular agapē fellowships while </p>
<p>the latter activities take place elsewhere. In that case, the sentence in verse </p>
<p>13 would read, “they nd sensual pleasure in daylight reveling—blots </p>
<p>(spilos), blemishes (mōmos), wild revelers (entryphōntes), and deceivers </p>
<p>(apatē)—while they also feast (syneuōcheomai) with you.” While this is </p>
<p>plausible, it would still not explain why the Petrine audience is unaware of </p>
<p>the false-teachers’ wild conduct or why they would tolerate it. Unless, of </p>
<p>course, they are totally unaware of any of the virtues that the author lays out </p>
<p>in chapter one, which would be quite unlikely. e anti-association or anti-</p>
<p>banquet idea is part of the overall Greco-Roman rhetorical strategy. ese </p>
<p>ancient discourses are best understood within the framework of intergroup </p>
<p>rivalries, identity construction, and group-boundary negotiation.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unlike, the use of blots and blemishes which are clearly metaphori-</p>
<p>cal, the next two accusations by 2 Peter have a greater likelihood of re-</p>
<p>ecting actual practices of the false-teachers. Description of wild revelers </p>
<p>(entryphōntes) and deceivers (apatē), while remaining within the realm of </p>
<p>stereotypes, may still capture some elements of their actions, especially if </p>
<p>they caused disruption in the community feasts.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> In Greco-Roman soci-</p>
<p>ety, public display of revelry was frowned upon, and was seen as a mark </p>
<p>of weakness and lack of self-control.</p>

<p>In gatherings like the associations,</p>
<p>while indeed getting drunk and exhibiting abusive conduct was common, </p>
