<p>Fusing the Horizons: Jude’s Inﬁltration Language in Light of an </p>
<p>African Proverb</p>
<p>A Swahili proverbs states, kikulacho kiko nguoni mwako (that which consumes </p>
<p>you is concealed within your clothing). This is an apt description of Jude’s </p>
<p>claim of his community’s inﬁltration by the opponents. According to Jude, </p>
<p>they have stolen into their midst and are wrecking havoc, seemingly unbe-</p>
<p>knownst to his audience. The common understanding of the Swahili saying </p>
<p>is that the source of one’s trouble is usually those closest to him or her. It is </p>
<p>usually used as a warning to the fact that those most likely to cause you the </p>
<p>gravest harm tend to be the ones closest to you, since they know both your </p>
<p>strengths and weaknesses. </p>
<p>Jude might as well have quoted this proverb to his readers for it captures </p>
<p>his concerns about his community, that those that are endangering their faith </p>
<p>have clandestinely become part of the community. They have endeared them-</p>
<p>selves to the believers and unless one is observant enough, he or she may </p>
<p>not realize that the inﬁltrators are doing grave harm to the community. They </p>
<p>exploit both the strengths and the weaknesses of Jude’s community and that </p>
<p>is why Jude’s letter is so urgent and uncompromising. The suitability of the </p>
<p>proverb is made even clearer by v. 23 of Jude where he uses the metaphor of </p>
<p>soiled clothing to describe the spiritual state of those who have been misled </p>
<p>by the inﬁltrators. Both the Swahili proverb and Jude urge caution, vigilance </p>
<p>and self examination!</p>
