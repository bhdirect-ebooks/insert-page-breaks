<p>Introduction to Jude and 2 Peter</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Date</p>
<p>e same split that we see in the arguments about authorship happens with </p>
<p>regard to the dating of the letter. Scholars who maintain the authenticity </p>
<p>arguments date the letter fairly early, either as early as the 50s/60s 0r 80s </p>
<p>CE, while those who think it is pseudepigraphical date it as late as the 90s </p>
<p>CE. e guideline dates that serve as points of reference are the well estab-</p>
<p>lished date of the destruction of the temple of Jerusalem by the Romans in </p>
<p>70 CE, and the traditional dating of the death of Jude’s brother James as 62 </p>
<p>CE. And since we have no record of Jude’s death, these serve as the plausible </p>
<p>references to the period within which the letter was constructed. Jude’s ref-</p>
<p>erence to himself as “the brother of James” (Jude 1) would assume he was </p>
<p>still alive and inuential in the early Christian community (even though </p>
<p>the reference does not require that James be alive) and would make most </p>
<p>sense if that is the authority with which he seeks to align himself in getting </p>
<p>his letter accorded the respect he desires. If that is the case then, one would </p>
<p>assume that the letter would have been written before 62 CE. </p>
<p>Relationship to 2 Peter also assists in trying to situate the letter, de-</p>
<p>pending on when one dates 2 Peter. Since 2 Peter utilizes and replicates a </p>
<p>substantial amount of the material in Jude, one must assume that there was </p>
<p>enough time for the letter of Jude to circulate among the churches and be </p>
<p>familiar to the author of 2 Peter but, at the same time, not be well known by </p>
<p>his audience who presumably did not know about Jude. at would be the </p>
<p>reason that the author of 2 Peter would have included such a fair amount of </p>
<p>the letter of Jude in his own letter while also performing some signicant </p>
<p>editorial work on it. </p>
<p>Eschatology</p>
<p>e issue of eschatology is important in both letters, but more pronounced </p>
<p>in 2 Peter where the scoers questioned what they perceived to be a delayed </p>
<p>return of Jesus (Parousia) in 2 Pet 3:8–10. Whether they had misunder-</p>
<p>stood the timeline as presented earlier by some Pauline letters or they had </p>
<p>simply misunderstood the anticipation of the earlier apostles, these scoers </p>
<p>referred to this perceived delay to argue that the message they had received </p>
<p>about the Gospel could not be sustained since none of the expected or pre-</p>
<p>dicted events had taken place. Second Peter then turned to Psalm 90 to </p>
<p>unearth a philosophical response to this accusation: “To the Lord a day is </p>
<p>like a thousand years and a thousand years, like a day.” </p>
