<p>Rescuing e Wavering</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>e same vocabulary in v. 6 is used of those that are kept (tēreō) await-</p>
ing divine judgment. Divine regulations must be therefore understood in
<p>both cases: both groups are being kept, but with radically dierent outcomes </p>
anticipated for each one. For the former, it is an expected divine and eternal judgment and for the latter, it is a divine blessing, of eternal life.
<p>Rescuing The Wavering (vv. 22–23)</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>And to those wavering,</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>show mercy.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Save these as if snatch-</p>
<p>ing them from re and showing mercy in fear; hating even the </p>
<p>deled clothing hanging from their bodies. </p>
<p>Following the example of God in v. 21, who exercises mercy awaiting the </p>
<p>coming judgment, the audience is encouraged to also exercise mercy to </p>
<p>those wavering (diakriō). It is not very clear who it is that Jude has in mind </p>
<p>when talking about the ones wavering. More likely than not it is not the </p>
<p>inltrators in view here, but those of the community who may have been </p>
<p>drawn away, or may be in danger of being drawn away by the inltrators. </p>
<p>e fact that there is hope for such ones contradicts the certainty of the </p>
<p>judgment that awaits the inltrators (v. 11). </p>
<p>is, instead, must be a third group, which is part of the beloved com-</p>
<p>munity, but they have found themselves being waylaid by the intruders and </p>
<p>are now in danger of falling o. e encouragement to seek aer such ones </p>
<p>is also in contrast to keeping away from the inltrators (v. 11). As such, </p>
<p>Jude calls on the community to show mercy and save them,</p>
<p>107</p>
<p> by snatch-</p>
<p>ing them from re (cf. Zech 3:2). e image of re here has to do with </p>
<p>its destructiveness and therefore refers to the teachings of the inltrators </p>
<p>that lead to destruction (cf. notes on v. 7). e re image also conjures the </p>
notion of divine judgment that is variously described, in Judeo-Christian
<p>sources (Isa 33:4; Jer 21:4; Amos 1:10; Matt 13:5, 18:8, 25:41; Mark 9:43–45; </p>
<p>1 Cor 3:11–15; 2 Pet 3:10; Rev 9:2; 20:9; 21:8; 1 Enoch 1:6–7; Jos Ant 1.2.3). </p>
<p>Jude, however, may be more specically drawing from Zech 3:3–4, </p>
<p>where Joshua’s lthy clothing signies Israel’s sinfulness which God re-</p>
<p>places with clean clothes.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>ose who have to do the saving in Jude are</p>
<p>advised to do it in fear (phobos), not in the sense of being scared but in the </p>
<p>106. Verb diakrinō, usually translated “to contend”, e.g., v. 9, here to means “doubt.” </p>
