<p>2 Peter 1:16–21</p>

prophetic words spoken by apostles had their origin in the divine Holy
<p>Spirit of God, and not in human imagination. It is the eyewitness claims </p>
<p>concerning the life of Jesus that opponents may have characterized as </p>
<p>cleverly devised myths/tales (sesophismenois mythois), with the intent of </p>
<p>derailing Petrine authority, allegations which the author now embarks on </p>
<p>stringently refuting. </p>
<p>Having made the declaration of his impending death (vv. 12–15), the </p>
<p>author now reminds the community of the basis of authority upon which </p>
<p>he shares his teachings with them. Switching from a rst person singular </p>
<p>when talking of his impending death to rst person plural we, the author </p>
<p>indicates his teaching is shared with others who also bore witness to its </p>
<p>reliability. </p>
<p>ese, therefore, are not simply personal opinions of the author but </p>
<p>are shared teachings which others, presumably apostolic community pres-</p>
<p>ent with Jesus at the mount of transguration (v. 18), who also bore witness </p>
<p>to them. In this regard, there was more than one eyewitness (epoptai) to an </p>
extraordinary event where divine conrmation of the divine status, author-
<p>ity and glory of Jesus were audibly pronounced and, by virtue of which </p>
<p>the author, and the other witnesses, gained special privilege or authority </p>
<p>regarding all matters relating to Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>An eyewitness account was</p>
<p>perceived to bear greater authority than hearsay, assuming it is the report </p>
<p>of one who was present at the event. at is why the role of the eyewitness </p>
<p>was to become crucial later as the Church deliberated what writings were </p>
<p>to be included in the NT canon. e two primary criteria were that a piece </p>
<p>of writing had to be traceable to an eyewitness of Jesus’ ministry, and sec-</p>
<p>ondly, should not have heretical teachings. </p>
<p>e content he refers to as having been made known (gnosis) to the </p>
<p>community involves the proclamation of our Lord Jesus Christ’s power </p>
<p>(dynamis) and appearance (parousia). e reference here is to the initial </p>
<p>proclamation of the gospel to the community, which as the author indicates </p>
<p>in his use of the rst person plural pronoun, he was part of. In Greco-Ro-</p>
<p>man society, the word parousia was used to describe the arrival of a ruler or </p>
<p>the appearance of a god. Typically in the NT, it is used of Jesus in reference </p>
<p>his “Messianic Advent in glory to judge the world at the end of this age.”</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> </p>
<p>erefore, it is unlikely that the reference here is to the incarnation since it </p>
<p>is typically the return of Jesus that is described as parousia in the NT (Matt </p>
