<p>Examples of Past Divine Judgments and Rescues</p>
<p>109</p>
In the second example of divine judgment, 2 Peter references the de-
<p>struction of the ancient world (archaiou cosmou) in the ood, where only </p>
<p>Noah and his family were saved (Gen 8:13–20). Both the story of sinful </p>
<p>angels and that of the Noahic ood, follow each other in Genesis (6, 8) and </p>
<p>are related; the ood (water) and judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah (re) </p>
were connected in Jewish literature as primary examples of divine judg-
<p>ment (Jub 20:5; Luke 17:26–30).</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>It is aer the sin of the angels’ cohabiting</p>
<p>with daughters of humans that the sinfulness of humans reaches an unbear-</p>
<p>able point for God who then decides to wipe out humanity and start over </p>
<p>with Noah and his family. </p>
<p>While Jude had followed his reference to angels with the example </p>
<p>of Sodom and Gomorrah, 2 Peter inserts a reference to Noah, the eighth </p>
<p>(ongdoos), in between. Noah was, counting together all the people that were </p>
<p>saved during the ood, the eighth person from Adam (Gen 7:23; 8:18; 1 Pet </p>
<p>3:20). Noah is called a preacher of righteousness in this verse, which is not </p>
<p>clear why, since in Gen 6:8–9 he is described as “righteous,” “blameless,” </p>
<p>and “faithful,” but never called a preacher. </p>
<p>As a noun, the word keryx (preacher, herald, proclaimer) is rare in </p>
<p>the NT appearing in only two other places—in 1 Tim 2:7 and 2 Tim 1:11—</p>
<p>where it is a self-description by the Pauline author on his own calling. It </p>
<p>is therefore more likely then, that 2 Peter draws from the Jewish tradition </p>
<p>that had developed a perspective of Noah as a preacher (e.g., Sib. Or. 1:129; </p>
<p>148–98; Josephus, Ant. 1.74; Gen. Rab. 30:7; Pirke R. Eliezer 22–23 [c. 80–</p>
<p>118 CE]). In this Jewish exegesis, the years Noah spent building the boat </p>
<p>are interpreted as a period of proclamation of the coming judgment, and of </p>
<p>delayed judgment, just like in 2 Peter.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Second Peter also removes references to Enoch, the archangel Mi-</p>
<p>chael, Cain, and Korah found in Jude 5–9, and in their place adds examples </p>
<p>of Noah and Lot. While 2 Peter keeps the reference to Balaam, it expands </p>
<p>on what Jude had to say, appending the piece about the reprimand by a </p>
<p>voiceless beast (2:15). e author also retains the example of Sodom and </p>
<p>Gomorrah used in Jude 7 but omits the mention of their desire for a dif-</p>
ferent esh (Jude 5) as the reason for divine judgment or the fact that their
<p>punishment is eternal and ongoing (Jude 7). Rather, he retains the distinc-</p>
<p>tion that they served as archetypes, examples (hupodeigma) of what would </p>
<p>happen to the ungodly (asebēs). Second Peter also avoids language of re in </p>
<p>15. Bauckham 1983: 253.</p>
