<p>2 Peter 2:12–16</p>

<p>as irrational beasts incapable of reason and therefore unable to attain </p>
<p>any proper understanding of the gospel message. eir destiny is certain </p>
<p>death—slaughter. is ignorance of the true knowledge (gnosis) means </p>
<p>they cannot show faithfulness (pistis) and instead, in their ignorance </p>
<p>(agnos), they blaspheme that which they do not understand. Lacking self-</p>
<p>control (enkrateia), they have lost ethical bearings, allowing themselves </p>
<p>to be controlled by their sensual appetites (hedonen, moichalidos) which </p>
<p>they have failed to reign in. e result is unrighteousness and abandoning </p>
<p>of the Godly way, reected in their self-indulgence (authadēs) and greed </p>
<p>(gymnazō), and their propensity to deception (apatē), even as they them-</p>
<p>selves seek to deceive others. </p>
<p>Lastly, reference to regular feast gatherings (syneuōcheomai) (v. 13) as </p>
<p>the locus of the concerns in this section means that all these negative ele-</p>
<p>ments that characterize the inuence of the false-teachers are best under-</p>
<p>stood, once again, in light of Greco-Roman meals and gatherings which, for </p>
<p>many minority groups in the Empire, presented the focal point of the social, </p>
<p>political, and religious identity formation.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>It is in this context that one can</p>
<p>identify the vices listed as representing a common trend of anti-banquet </p>
<p>accusations in intergroup conict, whose implications are political, social </p>
<p>and religious.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>is last section of 2 Peter 2 which has been classied as a</p>
<p>digressio, is a not only “a denunciatory description of the false-teachers,” it </p>
is primarily aimed at pointing to the inevitable divine judgment that awaits
<p>them.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Verse 12, drawing directly from Jude 10, begins the section of im-</p>
<p>ageries by comparing the false-teachers to irrational beasts, ready for </p>
<p>slaughter—a jarring image, to say the least! In Jude, the irrationality is </p>
<p>said to cause destruction but in 2 Peter, it is connected with beastly nature </p>
<p>whose raison d’etre is food supply. Where is the hope of repentance? Is it </p>
<p>already over for them? It is important to note that the use of the compara-</p>
<p>tive adjective like (hōs) puts the examples that are to follow in a generic </p>
<p>category—“they are like animals, they are not animals!” ey are behaving </p>
<p>like unreasoning beasts whose highest intrinsic value is simply as a source </p>
<p>of food. In essence, their greatest value comes when they are dead! Unfor-</p>
<p>tunately, that sounds rather ominous for the false-teachers. </p>
