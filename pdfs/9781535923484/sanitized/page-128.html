<p>2 Peter 2:4–6</p>
<p>108</p>
unable to escape divine judgment, followed by the judgment of the whole
<p>ancient world (sparing of Noah because of his righteousness), and nally </p>
<p>the judgment of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah which have come to </p>
epitomize divine judgment (Deut 29:23; Isa 13:19; Jer 23:14, 49:18; Lam
<p>4:6; Hos 11:8; Amos 4:11; Macc 2:5), make clear that the false-teacher’s </p>
<p>mistaken notion of a slumbering God is a sure sign of their inevitable dam-</p>
<p>nation. In contrast, by establishing a binary pattern of juxtaposing a judg-</p>
<p>ment example with a rescue example—ancient world/Noah, Sodom and </p>
<p>Gomorrah/Lot, save righteous/keep ungodly for judgment—the author </p>
<p>ascertained God’s power to save the faithful. </p>
<p>e conditional statement that begins this section, “if God did not </p>
<p>spare (pheidomai) angels,” leaves no doubt the fate the false-teachers and </p>
<p>their followers face, an inevitable encounter with God’s judgment. If God </p>
<p>did not spare the angels, the ancient world and Sodom and Gomorrah for </p>
<p>their sins, the false-teachers should expect no less. Angels rank higher </p>
<p>than humans in the scheme of things (2:11—angels have greater strength </p>
<p>and power), and if God condemned angels to judgment how can humans </p>
<p>expect any less? Coupled with judgment, the theme of insatiability is also </p>
<p>hinted at in the example the author gives of the angels. </p>
<p>While quoting directly from Jude 5, the author alters the reference </p>
<p>just enough in order to keep the sense of his preceding argument. He rst </p>
<p>leaves out Jude’s preceding example of Egypt (Jude 5), and then also elimi-</p>
<p>nates the reason attributed by Jude to the angels’ judgment—(who in the </p>
<p>early days (archen) did not carefully guard themselves (tēreō) but forsook </p>
<p>(apolipontas) their own dwelling/home)—and simply says they sinned </p>
<p>(hamatanō). However, he adds the location of the connement as total </p>
<p>darkness (zophou) which in 2:17 (zophos tou skotous) is the same fate that </p>
<p>awaits the false-teachers (cf. also LXX Job 40:20: 41:24; Prov 30:16; Philo, </p>
<p>Vit. Mos. 2. 433). </p>
<p>By so doing, 2 Peter’s alterations change Jude’s pattern of identifying </p>
the reasons for judgment as transgression of divine limits! Instead, 2 Peter
<p>focuses on the angels being chained or conned for their sins, assuming </p>
<p>that his readers know what he is referencing (Gen 6; 1 Enoch 6:1–26). In </p>
<p>essence, for 2 Peter, it was because the angels could not control themselves, </p>
<p>just like the false-teachers’ lack self-control, that they were conned. ey </p>
<p>are being kept (tēreō), until the judgment (krima) which, in line with Jude </p>
<p>6, is reference to the eschatological judgment (cf. 2 Pet 2:9, 17; 3:7). </p>
