<p>ree Examples of Divine Judgment of Ancient Israel, as Warnings</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>Verses 5–19 have been called a midrash,</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> have been analyzed as the cen-</p>
<p>terpiece of a hortatory speech,</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>and have been identied as a three-part</p>
<p>structure of a Greco-Roman letter.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> e tripartite structure is itself an iden-</p>
<p>tiable pattern within classical Greco-Roman epideictic (praise-blame) </p>
<p>rhetoric, culminating in a climax, just as in Jude’s case.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>e pattern of the</p>
<p>citation of Scripture followed by an explanation and application by Jude, </p>
<p>occurs three times in this section and makes all these analyses plausible. </p>
<p>e expression you all know tends to be interpreted by scholars as a </p>
<p>rhetorical device used by the author in line with other NT writings such as </p>
<p>Rom 15:15; 1 Cor 15:1 and 1 Pet 1:12, 31. e implication is that the readers </p>
<p>do have prior knowledge of the stories of Israel engraved in the writings </p>
<p>even though they emanate from dierent sources (Sir. 16:7–10; CD 2:17—</p>
<p>3:12; 3 Macc 2:4–7; T. Naph 3:4–5; m. Sanh 10:3).</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>e reference to laos (a</p>
<p>people) maintains the notion that not all the people that le Egypt in the </p>
<p>Exodus event were eventually guilty of sin. From among them were those </p>
<p>who got saved and those who, bound to their apostasy, were not. A case </p>
<p>has also been made that, without the article, laos here would indicate that </p>
<p>not all who le Egypt were believers.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>However, elsewhere Israel is called</p>
<p>laos tou theou (people of God—Exod 19:5; 1 Pet 2:9), and Jude’s truncated </p>
<p>version of laos may assume that the audience is aware of such a reference. </p>
<p>e point may be that even though all who le Egypt were laos, from </p>
among them were those who rebelled and paid the price of divine judg-
<p>ment. In this same say, it would suggest that the false-teachers may also </p>
have been part of Jude’s community and having rebelled now risk divine
<p>judgment.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>If this were the case, it would explain why the author assumes</p>
<p>that his audience is unaware of the inltration by those espousing contrary </p>
<p>teachings. If these were people initially familiar to the audience prior to </p>
<p>this point, then it would explain this assumption on the part of the author. </p>
<p>Jude is using examples from the Hebrew Scriptures as warnings of the </p>
<p>judgment that awaits the inltrators and any who would dare tag along with </p>
<p>them. Even while referring to the history of Israel, Jude’s rhetoric retains an </p>

<p>with some distinctions. See also Bauckham 1983: 5.</p>
