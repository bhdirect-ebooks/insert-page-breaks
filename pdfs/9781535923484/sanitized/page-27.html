<p>Introduction to Jude and 2 Peter</p>

<p>Such rhetoric not only seeks to paint the perceived enemy in as much </p>
<p>a negative light as possible, it does not necessarily claim to be historically </p>
<p>accurate in its portrayal of the perceived enemy. If the situation is one where </p>
<p>rival groups are competing to persuade the same population about who </p>
<p>is right, then the more the rhetoric escalates, increasingly becoming less </p>
<p>realistic, and more stereotypical, in how each group portrays the other. It is </p>
<p>less likely then to nd in such rhetoric accurate representation of the oppo-</p>
<p>nents’ views. Instead, one is likely to nd language that is characteristic of </p>
<p>stereotyping of the Other, by portraying them as less desirable, dependable, </p>
<p>lovable, acceptable, and even, less than human. is is probably even more </p>
<p>so if the competing groups share a lot in common, meaning they have to </p>
<p>nd whatever they think is distinct about themselves and contrast it, as </p>
<p>starkly as possible, with the competing group. </p>
<p>Greco-Roman associations, which included ocially recognized </p>
<p>groups, guilds, and gatherings of people who shared common trades such </p>
<p>as funeral support groups in Roman Empire, provide us with a glimpse </p>
<p>of how conict and competing identities frequently turned to stereotyping </p>
<p>as means to fend o any competing claims to the group’s distinct identity, </p>
<p>membership or boundary. As Harland explains, </p>
<p>Although rules may oen be drawn up to deal with problems that </p>
<p>were actually encountered, the regulations suggest that “good or-</p>
<p>der”—as dened by such groups—remained a prevalent value in </p>
<p>many banqueting settings. So we should not imagine that stories of </p>
<p>wild transgression are descriptive of real activities in immigrant or </p>
<p>cultural minority groups, or in other associations.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And as C. McGarty, V. Y. Yzerbyt, R. Spears, elaborate, “ese beliefs [ste-</p>
<p>reotypes] represent a necessary precondition for collective action such as </p>
<p>protest as well as for regulation and law enforcement. eir argument is </p>
<p>that stereotypes form to enable action. ey are political weapons that are </p>
<p>used in the attempt to achieve and resist social change.”</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>All these elements</p>
<p>are present in the way, for example, 2 Peter portrays the false-teachers and </p>
<p>Jude caricatures the inltrators. </p>
<p>ere is no doubt that in both Jude and 2 Peter we are dealing with </p>
<p>the three issues that Harland points out concerning minority groups’ inter-</p>
<p>actions—rivalry between author and inltrators/“false-teachers,” identity </p>
<p>construction (who is the true representation of the teachings of Jesus?), and </p>
