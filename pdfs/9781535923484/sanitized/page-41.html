<p>Introduction to Jude and 2 Peter</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>it considers false teaching posing as the truth—would seem to undermine </p>
<p>any claim of it being pseudepigraphy in the rst place. On the other hand, </p>
<p>the history of the reception of the document in the early Church does give </p>
<p>one pause. at notwithstanding, 2 Peter was eventually accepted into the </p>
<p>canon even as its authenticity concerns lingered. At this point then, Jerome’s </p>
<p>amanuensis explanation would seem to suciently address many of the </p>
<p>concerns 2 Peter raises about authorship, and remains as equally plausible </p>
<p>to any of the other possibilities adduced. </p>
<p>Opponents</p>
<p>e opponents in 2 Peter are identied as false-teachers (pseudodidaskaloi </p>
<p>—2:1) meaning they may have enjoyed a certain authority in the com-</p>
<p>munity as teachers. While the term is occasionally mistakenly applied to </p>
<p>the opponents in Jude, this term does not appear in the letter of Jude in </p>
<p>reference to the opponents in that letter. In spite of Michael Green’s insis-</p>
<p>tence that the opponents in the two letters share signicant similarities as </p>
<p>to warrant a conation, there is need to recognize that even the distinctive </p>
<p>use of the terminology in 2 Peter, that is missing in Jude, gives a specic </p>
<p>nuance to the characterization of the opponents in the letter as opposed to </p>
<p>those in Jude.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>e false-teachers basically seem to have cast doubt on the</p>
<p>apostolic teaching about the return of Jesus as a judge of creation dubbing </p>
<p>it a myth (1:16–17). Accordingly, there would be no return; there was no </p>
<p>need to have moral codes or virtues (2:19), given that it was not in the na-</p>
<p>ture of God to interfere in human aairs (3:5–7), since all evidence points </p>
<p>to a never changing universe (3:8–10). ese positions are reconstructed </p>
<p>from what 2 Peter refutes regarding the false-teacher’s perceived teachings, </p>
<p>but are not comprehensive enough to identify them with any specic rst-</p>
<p>century religious or philosophical group. </p>
<p>Genre </p>
<p>A key element of Bauckham’s psuedepigraphical authorship argument for </p>
<p>2 Peter rests on identication of the writing as a farewell testament (the last </p>
<p>words or wishes of a dying person of signicance, e.g., a patriarch).</p>
