<p>dening his or her own group as civilized by alienating another </p>
<p>as barbarous.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>At stake in Jude’s and 2 Peter’s accusations are also issues of decorum and </p>
<p>order, rituals and banquets.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>e behavior displayed by the opponents in</p>
<p>both letters ies in the face of the established social practices that govern </p>
<p>all Greco-Roman banquets and social gatherings. Both epistles make ref-</p>
<p>erence to “love feasts” (2 Peter 2:13—syneuōzocheomai: Jude 12—agapais, </p>
<p>syneuchomai) for the communities into which the false-teachers and inl-</p>
<p>trators, respectively, had introduced their untoward and scandalous behav-</p>
<p>iors and teachings. Both authors nd fault with their opponents, alleging </p>
<p>that their out of control shenanigans represent that which is “anti-banquet” </p>
<p>behavior which reects the image, to any outsider, of deplorable and out-</p>
<p>of-control gatherings that are not t to be classied within the category of </p>
<p>civil organizations. </p>
<p>Similar concerns are also highlighted in contemporary Jewish writings </p>
<p>on gatherings, giving us a glimpse of how such concerns were addressed, </p>
<p>providing a larger context for Jude and 2 Peter. Josephus Ant. 14:214–16 (c. </p>
<p>93 CE), for example, reports that Julius Caesar, in a letter to magistrates, al-</p>
<p>lowed the Jews in Rome “to collect money for common meals (sundeipna) </p>
<p>and sacred rites,” even though it does not mention the regularity of such </p>
<p>gatherings. Detailed meal gatherings and their decorum are outlined in </p>
<p>the Dead Sea Scrolls writings (1QS 6.2–13 and 1QSa 2.17–21), while Philo </p>
<p>compares what he considers the superior and civil Jewish therapeutae gath-</p>
<p>erings with those of Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians, which he portrays as </p>
<p>tending to be lled with out of control drinking, violence, and recklessness </p>
<p>that leads to “frenzy and madness” (Vit. Cont. 40–41; Flacc. 4: 136–37). </p>
<p>Tacitus, Hist. 5.5.2 (c. 115 CE), on the other hand, accuses the Jews of sup-</p>
<p>posed lurid and unlawful sexual practices in their gatherings.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Similarly, the authors of Jude and 2 Peter are determined to expose </p>
<p>the barbaric image of the anti-banquet attributed to their opponents, and </p>
<p>which they fear may expose the entire group to accusations of barbarism </p>
<p>and ritual uncleanness that reect lack of order and piety.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>In contrast,</p>
<p>they strive to dene their own communities in association terms that align </p>
<p>them with the respectable and recognized Greco-Roman associations. is </p>
