<p>Introduction to Jude and 2 Peter</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Stereotyping in Associations, and in Jude and 2 Peter</p>
<p>According to Harland, language common to many of the Greco-Roman </p>
<p>associations and groups typically stereotypes and vilies perceived oppo-</p>
<p>nents as sexual perverts, cannibals/barbaric, and murderers, all with the aim </p>
<p>of shoring up internal self denition and social identity at the expense of an </p>
<p>opponent’s.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>ese stereotypes therefore, had no intention of reecting any</p>
<p>actual historical practices.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> In Jude and 2 Peter, the opponents are char-</p>
<p>acterized using similar categories of sexual perversion (Jude 4, 18; 2 Pet </p>
<p>1:4, etc.), “wild brutes” (Jude 10, 19; 2 Pet 1:9; 2:10, etc.), and “blasphemy/</p>
<p>ungodly” (Jude 8–10; 2 Pet 3–4) resulting in death (2 Pet 1:10, 2:2, 10, etc.). </p>
<p>Also, the focus on value in 2 Peter retains parallels with the purity focus of </p>
<p>the Greco-Roman stereotype.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Drawing from Harland’s conclusion about</p>
<p>certain characteristics of the stereotyping language evident in the Greco-</p>
<p>Roman group dynamics, “novels, histories and ancient ethnographic mate-</p>
<p>rial,” the characterization of the opponents in Jude and 2 Peter therefore </p>
<p>closely parallels that which is found in the Greco-Roman discourses on </p>
<p>identity formation and boundary structuring.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Placed in the wider Greco-Roman association context, an analysis of </p>
<p>the group dynamics in Jude and 2 Peter would hopefully put in new light, </p>
<p>and further clarify, the harsh tone that the letters reect, and which re-</p>
<p>mains a disquieting aspect of the letters for most readers. Following Duane </p>
<p>F. Watson, the authors of Jude and 2 Peter were using ancient rhetoric, that </p>
<p>involved “articial proof” (entechnoi), in which case, “the rhetor seeks to </p>
<p>show his own and his client’s ethos in the best light and his opponent’s </p>
<p>in the worst.”</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>is parallel with association language however, does not</p>
<p>preclude Jude’s and 2 Peter’s clear agenda of iterating their conviction about </p>
<p>the centrality of the communities’ faith in God through Jesus. In fact, it is </p>
<p>in this regard that we will be able to witness their rhetorical inventiveness. </p>

<p>14. Harland 2009: 174. “ese . . . arise from a common stockpile of stereotypes of </p>
<p>the threatening other, and there is no need to look for any basis in the reality of actual </p>
<p>practices.”</p>
<p>15. Jude, however, may have maintained the caricature of the inltrators as “mur-</p>
<p>derers” and proponents of violence directly by associating them with the likes of Cain, </p>
<p>Balaam and Korah (v. 11).</p>
