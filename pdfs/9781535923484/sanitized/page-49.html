<p>Fusing the Horizons: True Christian Identity</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>itself a byproduct of colonial construction, fully infused (for good or ill) into </p>
<p>the psyche and language of the Kenyan community. Tribes have for millennia </p>
<p>provided the structure of the society, safeguarded the cultural elements and </p>
<p>preserved the languages of the communities. Tribes have played (and continue </p>
to play) a central role in shaping the identity of individuals in Africa. Thanks
<p>to the colonial borders, however, African countries have had to confront the </p>
<p>centrality of the tribal identity as it has stood in direct conﬂict with national </p>
<p>identity. As nationhood (ideology) has been placed before tribalism (blood-</p>
<p>line), the struggle to restructure African communal identity has ensued.</p>
<p>Similar to early Christian converts’ Christian-Pagan identity struggles, </p>
<p>the church in Africa has been plagued with competing identities making for </p>
challenging situations for the individual Christians. In the African church,
<p>age-old tribal identities and allegiances continue to provide some of the stiff-</p>
<p>est challenges for Christian converts.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> For example, during the ensuing post-</p>
<p>election violence in Kenya, driven in many respects by tribalism (as well as </p>
<p>political reasons), one of the most disheartening scenes was when a church, </p>
<p>full of women and children of one tribe seeking refuge from violence, was set </p>
<p>ablaze by a marauding mob of a neighboring tribe, killing most of the people </p>
<p>within.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Among the perpetrators, identiﬁed by some of the survivors, were</p>
<p>neighbors whose identities as members of Christian communities was known. </p>
<p>How could people identifying themselves with the Church participate in such </p>
<p>violence? One possible culprit in such a case would be the assumption that </p>
<p>the Christian identity, despite its presence in the country for more than two </p>
<p>hundred years, never quite took root enough to overcome the tribal identity as </p>
<p>the primary identity.</p>
<p>Jude’s restructuring of his identity vis-a-vis the person of Jesus, provides </p>
<p>a useful lesson on this matter. Jude, while he could have chosen to use the </p>
<p>bloodline (brother of Jesus) to construct his identity, instead chooses to iden-</p>
<p>tify himself as a slave of Jesus (a theological construction). Jude prioritizes </p>
<p>his theological identity over what perhaps others would have preferred, the </p>
<p>bloodline that would have given him more claim to authority as a sibling of </p>
<p>the Lord. Instead, by not only downplaying the use of biological identity as </p>
<p>his primary one, and instead using a theological identity that also embraces </p>
<p>a deep humility, he aligns himself with Paul who cautions that in Christ old </p>
