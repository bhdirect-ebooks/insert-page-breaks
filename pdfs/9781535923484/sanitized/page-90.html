<p>than its rival(s). Since honor could be lost or gained, it had to be constantly </p>
<p>guarded.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In political terms, there was shared honor for all citizens, which in </p>
<p>turn resulted in certain privileges. A good example is one found in the book </p>
<p>of Acts (16:13–40) where Paul, aer being publicly dishonored via public </p>
<p>whipping, only later identies himself as a Roman citizen forcing the Ro-</p>
<p>man authorities that had shamed him to try and spirit him out of the town </p>
<p>quietly, to avoid any legal ramications, but Paul demands a public apology </p>
<p>instead. J. D. Charles explains in his discussion of isotimon:</p>
<p>From a political standpoint, all citizens have the same position and </p>
<p>rights; they are thus isoi kai homoioi (Xenophon Hist. Graec. 7.1.1). </p>
<p>Political connotations carry over into the legal domain, infusing </p>
<p>law with a principle of judicial right; the law is no respecter of per-</p>
<p>sons. It is only natural that these legal connotations are translated </p>
<p>into the covenantal language of the NT, illustrated by 2 Pet 1:1. </p>
<p>Inasmuch as a reference to isotēs in Hellenistic culture reassures </p>
<p>the citizen of his or her rights and privileges, its application to </p>
<p>equality of spiritual allotment in the Christian life is particularly </p>
<p>meaningful.</p>

<p>is may indicate in the mind of the author of 2 Peter, and hopefully to the </p>
<p>reader, that even though Simeon Peter was an important eyewitness to the </p>
<p>historical Jesus, honored (timē) by God’s voice (1:17), the letter wished to </p>
<p>remind them that they have as high a status as Simeon Peter does, before </p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>at the esteemed disciples are, before God, equal to those who have</p>
<p>come to embrace the grace of God, through Jesus. It is an equality that </p>
<p>gives God’s honor to all, and raises the status of all who have committed </p>
<p>themselves to faith in God through Jesus the savior.</p>
<p>Similar language of honor derived from relationship with gods is at-</p>
<p>tested among Greco-Roman associations. Service and commitment to a </p>
<p>specic deity brought the recognition of honor (timē) among association </p>
<p>members in Greco-Roman empire, and signicant honor could propel </p>
<p>one up the social status ladder. For example, an ancient inscription from </p>
