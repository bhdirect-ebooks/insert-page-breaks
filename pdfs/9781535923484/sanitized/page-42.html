<p>Introduction to Jude and 2 Peter</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Bauckham, the nature of testaments is that they are all inherently, always </p>
<p>ctional, a claim questioned by other scholars.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>e elements that account</p>
<p>for identication of 2 Peter with this genre include: i) its reference to the </p>
<p>author’s impending death (1:12–14), ii) emphasis on moral exhortation </p>
<p>(virtues) which parallels other Testaments (1:5–7), iii) recounting (remi-</p>
<p>niscing?) of the arrival of the gospel message to the community (1:16–19), </p>
<p>and iv) warnings of impending dangers that must be resisted and fought </p>
<p>(2:1–3; 3:1–7). </p>
<p>Challenges to Bauckham have pointed out that a document can have </p>
<p>testamentary material without the whole writing being a Testament (e.g., </p>
<p>John 21, 1 Macc. 2), that there is no clear premise to presume that all testa-</p>
<p>mentary writings are pseudepigraphical, missing signicant testamentary </p>
<p>material in 2 Peter (e.g., a death scene), and rather than predicting arrival </p>
<p>of opponents they seem to already have arrived.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>Also, while today we may</p>
<p>understand documents such as the testamentary writings to have been </p>
<p>written in the name of worthies who had died ages before; it is not clear at </p>
<p>all whether rst or second century readers would have understood 2 Peter </p>
<p>that way.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>So while the testamentary elements are truly present, they are</p>
<p>not sucient to make the document a testament, and so the nature of the </p>
<p>documents remains one of an epistle—a farewell letter, to be exact.</p>
<p>Eschatology</p>
<p>ere is an image of changing attitudes and concerns about God’s ultimate </p>
<p>judgment of creation and the desire for assurance that promises made ear-</p>
<p>lier about the parousia of Jesus were still part of the present reality of the </p>
<p>readers. e agitation is being driven the teachings of the false-teachers </p>
<p>who have questioned the reliability of the message the community had </p>
<p>received from those who brought the gospel to them. Second Peter’s senti-</p>
<p>ments about the parousia are similar to those in Paul’s letters (1 ess 5:2) </p>
<p>and Revelation (3:5; 16:15). erefore, the day of the Lord is expected to </p>
<p>make a sudden appearance (2 Pet 3:10, 11) and calls for the readers to be </p>
<p>watchful (2 Pet 3:12). However 2 Peter does add an aspect to the parousia </p>
<p>in that it can be directly inuenced by the believers’ ethical response, has-</p>
<p>tening its appearance by moral conduct (2 Pet 3:12–14). Similarities can </p>
