<p>Introduction to Jude and 2 Peter</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>the ood as an example of God’s intervention in history—it would not </p>
<p>make sense if the history envisioned here is that of the Church.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>term, therefore, can easily have referred to the OT prophets who had </p>
<p>prophesied the initial parousia of Jesus. </p>
<p>4. Reference to a delayed “parousia (revelation) of the Lord” referring to </p>
<p>the second coming of Jesus (Matt 24:3; 1 ess 2:19; 4:15), indicating </p>
<p>that some long time had passed since the time of the apostle initial </p>
<p>ministry to the audience. In response, Webb has argued, it is not sim-</p>
<p>ply the denial of the second coming that the opponents represent in </p>
<p>their questioning but the concept of parousia at any period in time.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> </p>
<p>M. Green also points out that the greatest disappointment of the de-</p>
<p>layed parousia would have been reected more prominently in mid </p>
<p>rst century than in the second century where the eects of the shock </p>
<p>had waned.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>5. Reference to Paul’s letters as a “collection” and to the author’s equating </p>
<p>them to other “scripture” (3:15–16).</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>e tradition or copying and</p>
<p>sharing of Paul’s letters in the early Church may have been encouraged </p>
<p>by Paul himself (Col 4:16) and so should not be a surprise if the author </p>
<p>of 2 Peter is familiar with Paul’s writings. But nothing in the passage </p>
<p>here assumes a “Collection” of corpus, as proponents of this argument </p>
<p>assume.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the Council of Jerusalem, Peter and Paul</p>
<p>are united against the instigators (Acts 15:7–11).</p>
<p>6. Reading 2 Peter (and Jude) as if it is responding to the second-century </p>
<p>threat of Gnosticism. While 2 Peter does favor the term “knowledge” </p>
<p>(gnosis) from which we get the term Gnosticism (a form of early phi-</p>
<p>losophy that emphasized “special secret knowledge” as the means to </p>
<p>salvation), 2 Peter’s use of the term does not fully conform to Gnostic </p>
<p>thinking. Recent rhetorical studies of the letter however have shown </p>
<p>that, rather than focusing on fending o Gnosticism, 2 Peter’s primary </p>
<p>concern is with ethics as reected in the list of virtues (1:5–7), and the </p>

<p>62. Webb 2012: 476. “. . . the issue at hand is not a questioning of the parousia in </p>
<p>the future because of its delay, but rather a rejection of the truth of the parousia itself </p>
because there is no evidence of divine intervention and judgment in the past” (emphasis
<p>original).</p>
