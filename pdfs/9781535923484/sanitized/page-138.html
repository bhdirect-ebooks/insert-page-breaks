<p>2 Peter 2:12–16</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>common Greco-Roman intra-/inter-group rhetorical banter in group iden-</p>
<p>tity discourse. </p>
<p>Second, the characterizations of the false-teachers in this section can </p>
<p>be grouped into three main areas that bear close conformity to stereotyping </p>
<p>categories identied among Greco-Roman groups around the rst century, </p>
<p>which tended to be human sacrice, sexual perversion, and ungodliness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>32 </p>
<p>e section begins with characterization of the false-teachers as wild beasts </p>
<p>ready for slaughter (v. 12) and ends with the reference to Balaam’s beast </p>
<p>(dumb donkey) speaking him out of his madness (v. 16). e one category </p>
<p>that may not align with Harland’s list is “human sacrices.” However, that </p>
<p>may be the result of 2 Peter’s creative use of the categories.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a. Wild Beasts</p>
<p>- irrational beasts (aloga zoa), born to be captured and slaughtered </p>
<p>(v. 12); </p>
<p>b. Sexual Perverts/Insatiable Appetites </p>
<p>- corruption (v. 12); </p>
<p>- nd [sensual] pleasure in daylight reveling (truphēn) </p>
<p>- blots (spilos), blemishes (mōmos), </p>
<p>- wild revelers (entryphōntes), and deceivers (apatē) (v. 13); </p>
<p>- eyes full of adultery, insatiable (akatapaustos) for sin (v. 14)</p>
<p>- hearts that are exercised/trained in greediness (gymnazō) (v. 14)</p>
<p>c. Ungodly </p>
<p>- who in their ignorance (agnoeō) blaspheme (v. 12); </p>
<p>- unrighteous (adikia) (v. 13); </p>
<p>- abandoning straight path, going astray (v. 15)</p>
<p>- following unrighteous Balaam (v. 15) </p>
<p>ird, the description list of the false-teachers (2:10–15), while un-</p>
<p>doubtedly drawn from Jude, seems to counterbalance rather well with the </p>
<p>virtue list in 1:5–7 (below), leaving the clear impression that it is more than </p>
<p>32. Harland 2009: 169–81. </p>
<p>33. Watson 1988: 118. It is peculiar that 2 Peter does not capitalize on the “human </p>
<p>sacrice” category to talk about Jesus’ crucixion. But he seems to prefer not to talk about </p>
<p>crucixion and instead talk about glorication.</p>
