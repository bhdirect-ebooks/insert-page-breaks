<p>JUDE</p>
<p>Letter Opening and Greeting (vv. 1–2) </p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ, the brother of James, to those who </p>
<p>are beloved and called in God the father and are kept safe in Jesus </p>
<p>Christ; </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you. </p>
<p>Jude’s letter greeting, while still in keeping with Jewish salutations, is slightly </p>
<p>distinct from Paul’s “Grace and peace,” (Rom 1:8; 1 Cor 1:4–9; Phil 1:3–11; </p>
<p>1 ess 1:2–4; 2 ess 1:3; Phlm 4–7; 2 Tim 1:3–7) but is not a typical </p>
<p>Greek letter greeting which was simply chairein (“Greetings”), as seen in </p>
<p>James 1:1.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Jude replaces chairein with heleos (mercy) where Paul usually</p>
<p>uses grace, and adds Christian love (agapē), which Paul does not usually </p>
<p>have in his greetings. Mercy (Hebrew—chesed) and peace, likely originate </p>
<p>from the typical Jewish salutations of shalom (“peace”), which is more than </p>
<p>just a wish for peace but includes the notions of wellness, prosperity, and </p>
<p>wholeness.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>And since Jude ends the epistle with two mentions of mercy</p>
<p>(v. 24), both of which are related to the safe keeping of the believers until </p>
<p>eternal life, then it must also serve as an inclusio that encapsulates the es-</p>
<p>chatological context of the message.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>e author of this brief letter identies himself as Jude (Grk. Judas </p>
<p>or Judah), a common Jewish name (and calls himself a “slave of Jesus” and </p>
<p>“brother of James” (cf. Matt 13:55; Mark 6:3). In ancient literature, it is typi-</p>
<p>cal to identify oneself as son of so and so, which makes Jude’s identication </p>
<p>with his brother rather atypical.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>e most plausible reason for doing so</p>
<p>1. Davids 2011: 3; Bauckham 1983: 20</p>
<p>2. 2 Apoc. Bar. 78:2.</p>
<p>3. Bauckham 1983: 26; Webb 1996: 140. </p>
<p>4. Neyrey (1993: 47), explaining Jude’s relationship with James, points out that in an </p>
<p>ancient society governed by honor “[a] young sibling, whose birth ranks him lower than </p>
<p>his older brother, claims honor by blood ties with his richer, stronger, or more inuential </p>
<p>brother.” If this is the logic, it still does not explain why both Jude and James would then </p>
<p>avoid making explicit claims of blood ties with Jesus.</p>
