<p>2 Peter 1:3–4</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>Gaius Caesar Augustus and his whole household . . .”</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> while another in-</p>
<p>scriptions declares Caesar to be god (theos).</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is dicult not to see in 2 Peter a counterclaim, and a counter-narra-</p>
tive if you will, that seeks to establish Jesus as the rightful claimant of divine
<p>attribution, and not Caesar. e proclamation then is that, if emperors can </p>
claim or be declared to be divine by virtue of ascribed son-ship to deity,
<p>Jesus can more rightfully make that claim as the true God and savior. Faith </p>
<p>(pistis) is not reference to some organized doctrine, but is the basic ability </p>
<p>to put one’s trust in God; the act of belief in God, through Jesus Christ! </p>
<p>is contrasts with Jude for whom pistis (v. 5) suggests a body of teachings </p>
<p>passed down from the apostles. </p>
Aer ascribing divinity to Jesus in vv. 1–2, Peter separates the persons
<p>of God and Jesus in the following verse. e formula Grace and Peace . . . </p>
<p>to you may actually be a greeting formula since Paul also employs similar </p>
<p>phrases in several of his letters (Rom 1:7, 1 Cor 1:3; 2 Cor 1:2; Gal 1:3; Phil </p>
<p>1:2; Eph 1:2; Cf. also Rev 1:4), and would thus explain why, aer employing </p>
<p>the grammatical structure that identied Jesus as God in v. 1, he chooses </p>
<p>not to restructure this greeting formula. </p>
<p>e greeting formula itself combines the Christian concept of grace </p>
<p>(charis) with the Jewish greeting of shalom (peace, wholeness, wellbe-</p>
<p>ing, etc.). e wish that these aspects of God’s blessing be multiplied or </p>
<p>increased, goes hand in hand with the development he desires to see in </p>
<p>the community’s incremental progress in regards to their ethics (1:8). at </p>
<p>is why it is through the power of God that everything (panta) needed to </p>
<p>strive towards godly life, is given.</p>
<p>God’s Calling That Bestows Godly Nature (1:3–4)</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Just as we are given all things all things through the power of God </p>
<p>towards life and godliness, through the knowledge of he who calls </p>
<p>us to his glory and virtue/excellence, </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>through which our hon-</p>
<p>orable/precious and greatest promise is bestowed, in order that </p>
<p>through this you become co-partakers of Godly nature, escaping </p>
<p>from the world with its corrupt desires. </p>
<p>e knowledge (epignōsis) of God and/or Jesus is the grounds for fullness </p>
<p>of peace and grace (cf. letter closing, 3:18, where also grace and knowledge </p>
<p>14. IMT 573: Barth and Stauber 1993. </p>
<p>15. AGRW 160 = IEph 3801 (c. 35–54 CE).</p>
