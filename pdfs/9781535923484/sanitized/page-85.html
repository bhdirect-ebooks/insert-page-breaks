<p>Fusing the Horizons: Preaching From Jude</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>Another area of comparison for Jude is with the ancient prophets. Jude’s </p>
<p>language is not so different from that of some of the prophets in the HB/</p>
<p>OT (e.g., Amos, Isaiah, Jeremiah). In fact, some scholars have even sug-</p>
<p>gested that the earliest form of Israelite prophecy may have been primar-</p>
<p>ily pronouncement of curses on other peoples, much in the same vain as </p>
<p>Balaam’s.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>Even rhetoric against Reformation opponents by reformers such</p>
<p>as Calvin and Luther in the sixteenth century could itself be quite caustic and </p>
<p>downright abusive.</p>
<p>In this regard then, it may be the case that the issue is with our modern </p>
<p>sensitivity more than anything else. Also given our modern sensitivity to politi-</p>
<p>cal correctness, we fail to fully appreciate the deep concern that was driving </p>
<p>Jude’s rhetoric. Jude’s seemingly unforgiving stance is driven by the greater </p>
<p>concern with the imminent eschatological judgment for which all the believers </p>
<p>need to prepare themselves.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>For all intent and purpose, Jude believes they</p>
<p>are living in the last days warning that the activities of the inﬁltrators are clear </p>
<p>indication of this (vv. 17–19). While his language may make us bristle, it does </p>
<p>so because it is a large part of a very short letter, and so it appears markedly </p>
<p>pronounced and exaggerated.</p>
<p>Understanding the world of Jude, and how Jude relates to, and utilizes, </p>
<p>cultural and religious resources, allows us to better understand his rhetoric </p>
<p>and use of imagery.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> The distinctive element of Jude vis-à-vis other NT writ-</p>
<p>ings is that, while the others by virtue of their length also include a lot of other </p>
<p>teachings about salvation and God’s grace and mercy, Jude’s short letter does </p>
<p>not have much to say about that. That omission however should not be used </p>
<p>against Jude, for he wrote his letter to strictly address what he considered a </p>
<p>desperate and urgent situation for his community (v. 3). </p>
<p>Therefore, we have to be cognizant of the ancient world out of which </p>
<p>Jude emerged. We have to pay attention to such aspect as social values (e.g., </p>
<p>honor and shame), which dominated the ﬁrst-century Near Eastern cultural </p>
<p>world and not use modern day sensibilities to interpret the letter. We need </p>
<p>to pay attention to the role that stereotyping played in such public discourse </p>
<p>in order not to misconstrue the message of the letter. Shaming of an op-</p>
<p>ponent was part of the challenge-riposte that governs contested public space </p>
<p>in such cultures where the primacy of honor-shame in moral control remains </p>
<p>dominant. The rhetorical structure employed in Jude’s letter is highly sophis-</p>
