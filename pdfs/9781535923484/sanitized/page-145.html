<p>Stereotypical Characterization of False-Teachers</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>gunaikos moichalidos (adulterous woman, v. 20) makes up part of that </p>
<p>generation. </p>
<p>However, a teaching attributed to Jesus in the gospels maintains </p>
<p>that looking at a woman lustfully (epithymia) means already committing </p>
<p>adultery (moicheuō) with her (Matt 5:27–28) is the most likely source for </p>
<p>2 Peter. e second part of the statement about the false-teacher being in-</p>
<p>satiable for sin, accentuates the rst part. All the negative aspects prompt </p>
<p>the typically Jewish outburst of condemnation from the author, accursed </p>
<p>children!</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> e unspoken subject of the curse of course is God, who pro-</p>
<p>nounces judgment on all. </p>
<p>Second Peter’s appeal to the story of Balaam’s rebuke by the “dumb </p>
<p>donkey,” found in Numbers 22, is meant to highlight the failure of the false-</p>
<p>teachers to heed the warning about the danger of their chosen path. Since </p>
<p>they are said to have abandoned (kataleipo) the straight (euthys) path and </p>
<p>gone astray, then the assumption is that they previously belonged to the </p>
<p>straight path, a typical expression of acceptable conduct in the OT and NT </p>
<p>(1 Sam 12:23; Prov 3:5–6, 4:26; Psa 27:11; Isa 26:7; Hos 14:9; Acts 13:10). </p>
<p>It also anticipates a similar expression that refers to the way of righ-</p>
<p>teousness (2:21), which the false-teachers have abandoned. As such, these </p>
<p>false-teachers, unlike the inltrators in Jude, without doubt emerged from </p>
<p>the Petrine community and now pose a threat to it with their contrarian </p>
<p>teachings. Unfortunately, Balaam’s example does not help present us with </p>
<p>any clarity concerning the false-teachers’ teachings but simply seeks to </p>
<p>highlight their ultimate failure. Without questioning Balaam’s status as a </p>
<p>prophet, 2 Peter explains the donkey’s role in squelching the madness that </p>
<p>had entered the prophet.</p>

<p>Fusing the Horizons: Dangers of Stereotyping</p>
<p>While I have so far sought to give an apologia for the author of 2 Peter by </p>
<p>locating the writing within the larger Greco-Roman setting where stereotyp-</p>
<p>ing played signiﬁcant role in public discourse, I ﬁnd myself in a quandary </p>
<p>when I envision the ways stereotyping has been used in more recent history </p>
<p>to devastating effects, especially in Africa. Not only did the Europeans create </p>
<p>50. Kelly 1968: 342.</p>
<p>51. van Kooten 2008: 131–61. van Koosten’s essay suggests that Balaam serves as an </p>
<p>emblem of Philo’s opponents in his polemic against Second Sophist movement.”</p>
