<p>2 Peter 2:9–11</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>Michael and instead makes a generic reference to angels who avoid blas-</p>
phemy and subsequent divine judgment, even though they are more pow-
<p>erful than humans. </p>
<p>e reference to the Day of Judgment (hēmera kriseos) used here and </p>
<p>in 3:7, is in respect to the nal judgment, when God would judge the world. </p>
<p>While it may parallel the Hebrew “day of the Lord,” (Amos5:18–20; Isa 2:2; </p>
<p>Joel 2:28–32; Acts 2:17–21) the phrase is really only found in the NT in the </p>
<p>mouth of Jesus in the Matthew’s Gospel (Matt 10:15; 11:22, 24; 12:36), and </p>
<p>in 1 John 4:17. Given that 2 Peter’s citation of the transguration (2:16) </p>
<p>shows more resemblance to Matthew’s gospel, it makes sense to assume </p>
<p>that the expression’s background should be Matthew and not simply from </p>
<p>the HB/OT. In the passages in Matthew, the phrase appears in Jesus’ pro-</p>
<p>nouncement of the coming eschatological judgment, which he compares </p>
<p>to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, the two cities already cited </p>
by 2 Peter (2:7; following Jude 7), as a prime examples of the divine judg-
<p>ment that even now awaits the ungodly and rebellious. Later on, the phrase </p>
<p>appears again in 2 Peter 3:8–10 where the focus is to alleviate the concern </p>
<p>brought about by the false-teachers the apparent delayed parousia (appear-</p>
<p>ance of the Lord in judgment). </p>
<p>So while the Petrine community can be assured of God’s ability to </p>
<p>rescue them (rhyomai), the unrighteous (including the false-teachers) can </p>
<p>also be assured that they will be kept (tēreō) for judgment, in the same </p>
<p>manner that in 2 Peter 3:7, the “present heavens and earth” are kept (tēreō) </p>
<p>for destruction by re, on the Day of Judgment of the ungodly. In Jude 6, </p>
<p>it is the sinful angels kept (tēreō) for the Day of Judgment. And while in </p>
<p>Jude the sinful angels were to serve as a warning to the inltrators and </p>
<p>their ungodliness, hoping to induce change, in 2 Peter there seems to be </p>
<p>no room for repentance. e fate of the unrighteous is pronounced and </p>
<p>its eect is expected to last to the Day of Judgment. e heavens and earth </p>
<p>simply await their already decided fate. Unlike Jude, there seems to be here, </p>
<p>no hope at all of their salvation, as their fate seems already sealed, simply </p>
<p>awaiting the arrival of the judgment day. </p>
<p>Furthermore, not only are the false-teachers being kept for judgment, </p>
<p>the unrighteous in general, are being kept in/under punishment (kolazō) </p>
<p>until the Judgments Day. is is a dicult Greek phrase to interpret and </p>
<p>makes its implication unsure—is it a continuing state of punishment as </p>
<p>the Greek seems to presume</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>or is it an anticipated period of punishment</p>
