<p>Excursus: Aselgeia</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>relationship to God and to each other, on which the community should build </p>
<p>upon in order to prosper and gain spiritual maturity. </p>
If that is the case, aselgeia is thus not simply a description of individual
<p>sexual deviance (even though it includes that) but a characterization of a </p>
<p>group’s (false-teachers’ and company) tendency towards activities rejecting </p>
<p>Jesus’ authority by failing to display virtue/excellence (arete¯ ), knowledge (gno-</p>
<p>sis), self-control (enkrateia), longsuffering/endurance (hupomone), godliness </p>
<p>(euse¯ beia), sibling kindness (philadelphia), and love (agape) (1:5–7). Its use </p>
<p>also by 2 Peter strongly implies that, in some regards, being outside of the </p>
<p>author’s recipient community is automatically being in aselgeia. This is es-</p>
<p>sentially what constitutes their blasphemy (v. 2); their rejection of the way of </p>
<p>truth (hodos aletheias).</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>For such ones, really, there is no hope.</p>
<p>Once again, while this inside/outside characterization may reﬂect some </p>
<p>historical reality on the ground, it is more likely that it connotes stereotyping </p>
<p>of perceived enemies among competing groups as evidenced in Greco-Roman </p>
<p>associations. It is primarily rhetorical vituperation—“we have order and self-</p>
<p>control, they are in total chaos and out of control.”</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>In essence, aselgeia is</p>
<p>an anti-morality stance, which is a general characterization of any persons </p>
<p>that fails to inculcate the attributes proposed by the author in 1:5–6. It is a </p>
<p>transgression against all desirable aspects of faith and community life that the </p>
<p>author lays out for the community to cultivate.</p>
<p>It is thus a stereotyping of the perceived enemies, the false-teachers, </p>
<p>who represent the anti-morality and anti-banquet and, therefore ungodly </p>
<p>perspective, against which he is advocating. That is why, it is by means of </p>
<p>aselgeia that, the false-teachers are accused of waylaying new converts from </p>
<p>the Petrine community (2:18). Aselgeia then seems to be a catchall phrase for </p>
<p>those who are the perceived enemies, without really giving us much of what </p>
<p>excess they exemplify or indulge in. </p>
<p>There is no speciﬁc mention of what these teachings entail in 2 Peter but </p>
<p>rather there is a sweeping condemnation of the false-teachers as those whose </p>
<p>judgment, long ago pronounced, is certain to arrive soon. Therefore, if these </p>
<p>accusations are not historically accurate but are stereotypical, as we claim, </p>
<p>then what we have here may be understood in terms of political propaganda </p>
<p>7. e phrase “way of truth” may also echo the Johannine Jesus’ pronouncement to be </p>
<p>“the way, the truth and the life” (John 14:6). e distinct dierence is that in John it Jesus </p>
<p>himself is the subject but in 2 Peter truth refers to teachings.</p>
