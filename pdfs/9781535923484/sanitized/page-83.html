<p>Conclusion and Benediction</p>

<p>armation by committing the audience to the one able to guard them the </p>
<p>only God and savior Jesus Christ. Having ended the previous section (vv. </p>
<p>21–23) with the need for abundant caution for those who would be rescu-</p>
<p>ing the wavering ones lest they too fall, he quickly reassures them that he </p>
<p>commits them to God who is able to keep them from stumbling. While </p>
<p>remaining careful, they can also remain condent that God is able to keep </p>
<p>them secure. Given that the clothing of the wavering ones was stained in </p>
<p>sin (v. 23), in contrast, God is able to actually keep the believers safe so that </p>
<p>they can appear at the nal judgment, without blemish and in extreme </p>
<p>gladness (v. 24). </p>
<p>e emphasis by Jude on the Christian God as the only God (monō </p>
<p>theous) must consciously be a proclamation that deliberately contests the </p>
<p>Greco-Roman religious pantheon as we mentioned in v. 4. Part of Pax Ro-</p>
<p>mana was assimilation, or at least inclusion of conquered people’s deities </p>
<p>into the pantheon, as long as the Romans did not perceive such a conquered </p>
<p>peoples as barbarians, whose religious practice was superstitio rather than </p>
<p>the more sophisticated religio.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>For example, the Roman pantheon had</p>
<p>assimilated the Greek gods resulting in the equation of Greek gods with </p>
<p>their Roman counterparts (e.g., Zeus with Jupiter or Artemis with Diana). </p>
<p>It was also common to describe the Greco-Roman god as savior. For </p>
<p>example, in a slab inscription found in Philadelphia, Asia Minor (c. 1 CE), </p>
<p>it declares, “For in this house altars have been set up for Zeus Eumenes and </p>
<p>Hestia his consort, for the other Saviour gods.”</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>So, by Jude declaring there</p>
<p>was only one God, it was clearly a statement of resistance of any Roman </p>
<p>attempt at co-opting the Christian God as simply another deity in the pan-</p>
<p>theon. is God will subject all of creation to the nal judgment since all </p>
<p>power and authority belong to him. Not just for a certain period of time, </p>
<p>but for all time—now and forever more, amen.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Preaching From Jude</p>
<p>When was the last time you heard the epistle of Jude preached from a church </p>
<p>pulpit? Perhaps, never! The challenge that Jude poses for the new covenant </p>
<p>community is its polemical language, which is usually shocking to ﬁrst time </p>
<p>readers of the epistle. This viliﬁcation language sits uneasily for the modern </p>
