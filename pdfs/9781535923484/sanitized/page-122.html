<p>2 Peter 2:1–3</p>

<p>which he is quite certain (1:19) having counted himself among the wit-</p>
<p>nesses. And, since the prophet’s word originates from God’s Holy Spirit </p>
<p>(1:21), by predicting the coming of the false-teachers he would be proven a </p>
<p>true prophet, when it does happen. </p>
<p>Furthermore, by virtue of equating the false-prophets </p>
<p>(pseudoprophētēs) of the past with the anticipated false-teachers (pseudo-</p>
<p>didaskalos) (2:1), the author is, in countermeasure, equating himself with </p>
<p>the true prophets. e parallel he draws—showing both false-prophets </p>
<p>and false-teachers as destructive, heretical, and deceptive—turns the false-</p>
<p>teachers’ claim to authority on its head. ey falsely claim to be teachers but </p>
lack divine authority to make that claim.
<p>e compound word pseudodidaskalos is a hapax legomenon (appears </p>
<p>only here in the entire NT) and is possibly the author’s own creation to </p>
<p>parallel with pseudoprophetai found also in the LXX (Isa 41:25; Jer 50:36) </p>
<p>and in the NT (Matt 7:15; 24:11, 24; Mark 13:22; Luke 6:26; Acts 13:6; 1 </p>
<p>John 4:1; Rev 19:20; 20:10). It could either mean falsely named teachers </p>
<p>or that they are simply counterfeits claiming to be what they are not.</p>

<p>e</p>
<p>central issue by the author of 2 Peter concerning the false-teachers involves </p>
<p>the denial of the authority or lordship of Jesus Christ (2:1). is may imply </p>
<p>a turning away by the false-teachers from a previously held theological po-</p>
<p>sition, even though this notion is not demanded by the verb pareisago (to </p>
<p>steal in/inltrate), which could also be understood simply as having come </p>
<p>in secretly from outside. </p>
<p>However, since the false-teachers seem to be well known by the com-</p>
<p>munity and only the author raises ire about their activity, the former as-</p>
<p>sumption makes more sense. Furthermore, combined with the fact that the </p>
<p>false-teachers are said to arise from among you (writer’s audience) much </p>
<p>in the same way that false prophets arose among the people [of Israel]—</p>
<p>laos (Isa 41:29; 44:25; Jer 14:14; 23:16, 32; Ezek 13:6–9) seems to support </p>
<p>this assumption. is being the case then, it is best if we understood the </p>
<p>false-teachers as former members of the group who have strayed from the </p>
<p>teachings of the group and now espouse a dierent doctrine. </p>
<p>What these false-teachers bring is a certainty of destruction upon </p>
<p>themselves and their followers, since by rejecting the authority of Jesus, </p>
<p>they essentially put themselves outside of God’s grace (1:4). e word apo-</p>
<p>leia is a favorite of 2 Peter in describing the fate of the false-teachers—they </p>
<p>are damned to destruction! Besides appearing here twice, apoleia also </p>
