<p>Meaning of Delayed Parousia? God’s Patience And Mercy </p>
<p>For Sinners! (3:8–10)</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>However, do not let this escape from you, beloved, for with the </p>
<p>lord, “one day is like a thousand years, and one thousand years like </p>
<p>one day!” </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>e lord is not slow on promises, as some may consider </p>
<p>slowness to be, but is patient concerning you, not wishing any one </p>
<p>to be destroyed but all to have room for repentance. </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>But the day </p>
<p>of the lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens with a loud </p>
<p>noise, will pass away and elements dissolved in intense heat. And </p>
<p>the earth, with its entire works, will be exposed. </p>
<p>Turning his attention now to his audience, 2 Peter seeks to bring reassur-</p>
<p>ance that God’s promises are not annulled by our limited sense of under-</p>
<p>standing of time. What marks this transition is 2 Peter’s direct address of </p>
<p>his audience with the endearing term beloved (agapetos) which he repeats </p>
<p>in the rest of this section (vv. 14, 15, 17). Additionally, in a pointed contras-</p>
<p>tive comparison with the “scoers” who ignore the evidence of God’s grace, </p>
<p>he urges the audience not to ignore what the Scriptures have to say about </p>
the human inability to conceptualize divine time.
<p>Indeed, for 2 Peter, we can only grasp partial aspects of time from our </p>
inadequate vantage point. us, we are not t to account for divine time-
<p>tables whose comprehension is outside of our scope of intellectual capacity. </p>
<p>e use of the present indicative bradynō (to be slow) may also imply slow-</p>
<p>ness caused by hesitation, as though one was unsure of their action.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is questioning of the parousia is probably the one teaching that we </p>
<p>can say with condence was propagated by the false-teachers/”scoers.” </p>
<p>is teaching is refuted by the author, who essentially reconstitutes the ar-</p>
gument as one of changes in human perception rather than divine slipup.
<p>Impatience about the arrival of the day of the Lord is a failure to appreciate </p>
divine patience and grace. Yet, it remains clear that without doubt it will
<p>arrive, and unexpectedly—like a thief (v. 10). is concept of the day of the </p>
<p>Lord arriving “like a thief ” is drawn directly from Paul’s rst letter to the </p>
<p>essalonians (5:2) which uses the exact same phrase, not surprising given </p>
<p>the authors admission to familiarity with Paul’s letters (3:15–16). </p>
<p>Neyrey has explained that at stake here is also the honor of God.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e question is whether God can keep God’s word—promise (epangelia). </p>
