<p>Delay of Parousia</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>passage has rightfully been analyzed as a rallying call to resistance by the </p>
<p>author against the claims of the scoers.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Are these “scoers” same as the false-teachers? Both are expected to </p>
<p>arrive in some future time. However, the future here may be relative to </p>
<p>the time that the prediction of their coming was made, since the author </p>
<p>understands the present to be the end of times (3:11–14). Classifying them </p>
<p>as indulging strong unbridled desires (epithymia) harks back to the ste-</p>
<p>reotyping of the false-teachers that we discussed earlier (see commentary </p>
<p>on 2:10, 18, above. Cf. also Jude 16, 18) suggesting this is the same group. </p>
<p>What we are given here, however, is perhaps the reason that “sco-</p>
<p>ers” nd no need for restraint: the promised parousia (visitation) has not </p>
<p>materialized, and may never materialize (according to them), since things </p>
<p>have been the same for generations. Once again, it leaves no doubt that </p>
<p>these “scoers,” like the false-teachers, were initially part of the Petrine </p>
<p>community whose questioning of the groups fundamental teachings has </p>
<p>made them persona non grata. </p>
<p>It seems unlikely that the parousia would be referring to the initial </p>
<p>advent of Jesus since it is already looking at the eschaton (end) in a manner </p>
<p>that aligns with the promised return of Jesus in Acts 1:10–11. Instead, it </p>
<p>may refer to the arrival of the Kingdom of God which Jesus had promised </p>
<p>in the gospels (Matt 6:33; Mark 9:1), preached by apostles (1 ess 2:19; </p>
<p>4:15), and of which the apostles enquired about even just before Jesus’ as-</p>
<p>cension (Acts 1:8–9).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Verse 11, however makes it more likely that it is the</p>
<p>day of the Lord that they may have in mind, which may not clarify which </p>
<p>of the two events it refers to, and may even possibly have them combined as </p>
<p>one eschatological event. </p>
<p>Either way, for the “scoers,” theirs is a feeling of betrayal viz the ap-</p>
<p>ostolic message given to them about the soon expected visitation of God, </p>
<p>which as far as they are concerned has not taken place as promised. And </p>
<p>if that message was wrong, they would argue, what else about Christianity </p>
<p>would also be wrong? Without evidence of this central expectation of the </p>
<p>message about Jesus, on what ground can the followers stand and maintain </p>
<p>their hope for a glorious end? Why bother now, if there is nothing to look </p>
<p>9. Rodriguez 1997: 193–206. He argues that the call to recognize God as the control-</p>
<p>ler of history provides grounds on which to resist those who reject the expectation of the </p>
<p>parousia.</p>
