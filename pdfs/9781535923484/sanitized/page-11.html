<p>Preface</p>
<p>Writing a commentary has proved to be quite the daunting task, and evi-</p>
<p>dently a most distinct one from all other forms of research I have engaged </p>
<p>in. Starting with doing my own translation of the text from Greek, to writ-</p>
<p>ing my own independent interpretations before I read any of the other </p>
<p>commentaries and nally writing as judiciously as possible in order to stay </p>
<p>within the word limit, while trying to be as comprehensive in each sec-</p>
<p>tion as I possibly could, was a most challenging balancing act. It gave me </p>
<p>renewed respect for those who have gone ahead of me in this venture, espe-</p>
<p>cially before the age of computers. Yet, it was a most rewarding experience, </p>
<p>which I hope brings some measure of contribution to these lesser-indulged </p>
<p>in letters of the New Testament.</p>
<p>e freedom granted by the series editors was crucial in providing </p>
<p>the space to engage Jude and 2 Peter from the two vantage points that I </p>
<p>considered vital in breathing new insight in these short but important </p>
<p>writings—communal identity and Greco-Roman associations. A renewed </p>
<p>interest in Greco-Roman associations, especially from the works of Philip </p>
<p>Harland, provide aspects of comparison that I hope introduce new per-</p>
<p>spectives on the role of minority group rhetoric from the rst century and </p>
<p>act as a sounding board to the rhetoric in Jude and 2 Peter. Secondly, the </p>
<p>Fusing of the Horizons sections provide a useful avenue to reect on mod-</p>
<p>ern implications of reading certain elements of the epistles within contexts </p>
<p>of the modern communities with which I am familiar. I sincerely hope that </p>
<p>the ndings oer some distinctive contribution to the study of these letters.</p>
<p>Without downplaying my indebtedness to the prodigious minds that </p>
<p>have gone before me in writing commentaries on Jude and 2 Peter, I quite </p>
<p>consciously sought to limit my footnotes so that as much of my own reec-</p>
<p>tions on the texts were not obscured by side comments and discussions. </p>
<p>Aware that the readership for the series aims for an academically informed </p>
<p>reader, but one who may not have the technical background needed to </p>
<p>engage in the Greek text, I have sought to limit overt engagements with </p>
<p>technical commentaries and tried as much as possible to present a running </p>
<p>commentary as best as I could. e imprint, upon my own work, of such </p>
