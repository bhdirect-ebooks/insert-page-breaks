<p>Jude understands his place in this relationship as one where he is fully and </p>
<p>wholly under Jesus’ lordship. </p>
<p>Given that slavery was not necessarily a desired status in the Greco-</p>
<p>Roman world it is not necessarily an appealing self-descriptor. However, it </p>
<p>was not uncommon for those who owned slaves to use them as spokesper-</p>
<p>sons on their behalf. Such occasions vicariously infused the slave with vest-</p>
<p>ed authority by playing the role of a quasi vicegerent. By implication then, </p>
<p>Jude is aware that slavery to Jesus brings a certain honor by association with </p>
<p>the gloried Lord, while at the same time allowing him a semblance of hu-</p>
<p>mility.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Parallels can be seen, in an Egyptian inscription where Primos and</p>
<p>Ioukoundos, though described as “slaves of Caesar,” were highly regarded </p>
<p>since they occupied the oce of synagogue leader and president, and head </p>
<p>of gymnasium, respectively:</p>
<p>In the 25th year of Caesar, on the 22nd of the month of Hathyr, at </p>
<p>the assembly that occurred in Paratomos of the synod (synodos) </p>
<p>of the god emperor Caesar Augustus, whose synagogue-leader </p>
<p>(synagōgos) and president (prostatēs) is Primos, a slave of Caesar, </p>
<p>and whose priest is Ioukoundos, a slave of Caesar, and whose </p>
<p>head of the gymnasium is Alexandros, with most of the members </p>
<p>assembled.”</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e same interplay between the honor and humility found in Jude is also </p>
<p>present here. A biblical parallel is in Luke 14:15–24, depicting a parable of </p>
<p>Jesus where the slave, acting on behalf of the master, is able to act violently </p>
<p>against freepersons. e authority the slave exercises emanates not from </p>
<p>himself, but from his master who invests him with authority.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Besides connection with Jesus, Jude also claims to be a sibling of </p>
<p>one with signicant repute within the larger Christian community, and a </p>
<p>leader of the church in Jerusalem—James (Acts 12:17; 15). Jude once again </p>
<p>manages to stake a claim of authority while all the time retaining an air of </p>
<p>humility.</p>
<p>e only diculty with the title doulos (slave) would depend on the </p>
<p>actual social status of those addressed. If they are freepersons, then the </p>
<p>11. Martin 1990: 35. While focusing on the Greco-Roman metaphor of populist lead-</p>
<p>ers being “enslaved” to their followers, Martin also notes “. . . the well-placed slave of an </p>
<p>important woman or man was an important person. It mattered less that one was a slave </p>
<p>than whose slave one was.” Cf. also discussion of slaves as surrogate bodies for slavehold-</p>
<p>ers in Jennifer Glancy (2006: 11–16, 120, 131).</p>
