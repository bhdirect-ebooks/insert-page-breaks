<p>Fusing the Horizons: Preaching From Jude</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>by-product of stereotyping of the Other instituted by the colonial overloads </p>
<p>upon the people of the regions racially and artiﬁcially rating a chasm between </p>
<p>Hutus and Tutsis.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>In all fairness, we do not really get to hear the opponents’ position and </p>
<p>can only infer it from what are clearly exaggerated accusations and viliﬁca-</p>
<p>tions by Jude. It is possible that, given its very short length, the main focus </p>
<p>was really on the urgency of keeping the faith of the community intact by </p>
<p>decisively exposing the inﬁltrators, and so the negative portrayal dominates </p>
<p>Jude’s discourse. On the other hand, this may be somewhat ameliorated by </p>
<p>understanding the eschatological urgency with which Jude was writing. </p>
