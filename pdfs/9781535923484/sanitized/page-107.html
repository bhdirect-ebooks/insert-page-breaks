<p>Personal Reections of Impending Death by Author</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>awareness of his impending death and a reminder of his teachings, so that </p>
<p>they would not be forgotten. </p>
<p>However, postulation of this testamentary section as a genre designa-</p>
<p>tion of the entire letter is not necessary since testamentary anecdotes do </p>
<p>appear in documents without turning the whole writing into a testament.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Similarly, it has been shown that the pseudepigraphical nature of the Hel-</p>
<p>lenistic Jewish testaments cannot be used as supporting argument to desig-</p>
<p>nate 2 Peter as pseudepigraphy.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Having warned the community about the danger of forgetfulness </p>
<p>(1:9), the author makes it his personal responsibility to keep reminding </p>
<p>them, even though they already know the revealed truth (parousē ale-</p>
<p>theia). e truth that is revealed is what has been discussed so far in the </p>
<p>letter—God has called them to salvation through Jesus Christ, which has </p>
<p>to be manifest in their conduct shaped by the virtues list above. is is the </p>
<p>truth to which the apostles and eyewitness bore witness (1:16–21). It will </p>
<p>also soon be contrasted to the opponents’ teachings, which he describes as </p>
<p>teachings of falsehood or anti-truth.</p>
<p>Condent that they already know what he is saying or about to say, </p>
<p>(he uses the verb oida meaning that they have the information rather than </p>
<p>gnosis which would imply that they have internalized the knowledge) he </p>
<p>nevertheless is not convinced that they have internalized it enough and he </p>
<p>still sees the need for continued reminding. </p>
<p>Revealed truth is a Christian (Jewish?) expression of a certain un-</p>
<p>derstanding of speaking about God’s revelation to the chosen people (Gal </p>
<p>2:5, 14: Eph 1:13; Col 1:5–6; 2 Tim 2:15; Jas 1:18, 5:19). Already having </p>
<p>identied his community as such in v. 10 (elect and chosen), they can rest </p>
<p>assured that what they know is from a reliable source. It is not from human </p>
thought or imagination but is a certainty divinely revealed (pariemi) and,
<p>therefore can be fully trusted. However, unlike the urgency driven by the </p>
<p>concern about the activity of the opponents in later chapters, this time it </p>
<p>is the author’s own mortality conrmed in a revelation by our Lord Jesus </p>
<p>Christ (v. 13) that is the driving force. </p>
<p>e lengthy deliberation by the author (or more precisely, of the </p>
<p>presumed author, Simeon Peter) about his impending demise is what has </p>
<p>52. Proponents of this view include: Munck 1950: 155–70; Reicke 1964: 143–47, </p>
<p>Bauckham 1983: 141–43; 194–6, Bauckham 1988: 469–94. Recent opponents include </p>
<p>Green 2008: 207; and Matthews 2011: 51–64.</p>
<p>53. Green 2008: 167; Matthews 2011: 52–57.</p>
