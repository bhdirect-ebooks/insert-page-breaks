<p>Fate of the Inltrators as Predicted by Enoch</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>preceding characters from the HB/OT. His are reliable words to pay heed </p>
<p>to, in contrast to the unreliability of the inltrators. </p>
<p>Probably quoting from memory, Jude cites 1 Enoch 1:9, a prophecy </p>
<p>concerning the nal judgment. From early on, the validity of the reference </p>
<p>to non-canonical writings such as 1 Enoch or Testament of the Twelve that </p>
<p>Jude makes, have been debated. In the third century, Tertullian defended </p>
<p>the epistle’s canonicity and showed no major qualms about the use of 1 </p>
<p>Enoch.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p> Venerable Bede, the seventh-century Benedictine exegete, in de-</p>
<p>fense of Jude’s canonicity, summarizes the issues that have been raised on </p>
<p>this concern: </p>
<p>Indeed, it was precisely because Jude quotes [Enoch] that for a </p>
<p>long time his letter was rejected by many as being un-canonical. </p>
<p>Nevertheless it deserves to be included in the canon because of its </p>
<p>author, its antiquity and the way in which it has been used, and </p>
<p>particularly because this passage which Jude takes from Enoch is </p>
<p>in not itself apocryphal or dubious but is rather notable for the </p>
<p>clarity with which it testies to the true light.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>While it has become increasingly clear that such writings as 1 Enoch </p>
<p>were considered, if not canonical, at least at par with scripture in some Jew-</p>
<p>ish circles such as in Qumran, it is possible that Jude is also exploiting his </p>
<p>readers’ or opponents’ anity for the writing.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>e turn of phrases here combines the stereotypes we have already </p>
<p>encountered above (sexual depravity, v. 4) with the addition of the inl-</p>
<p>trator’s self-glorifying aggrandizement (disputing, haughtiness, and falter-</p>
<p>ing). ese accusations also parallel the elements of anti-banquet attested </p>
<p>in Greco-Roman associations (see pg. 46). e expressed requirement </p>
<p>of order, decorum, and piety in association gatherings is clearly violated </p>
<p>by the inltrators who instead are argumentative and boastful (murmur, </p>
<p>quarrel, pompous words), sexual philanderers (lust), greedy, and impious </p>
<p>(asebeia).</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>Jude’s rhetoric bears clear resemblance to polemical rhetoric in</p>
<p>Greco-Roman groups and associations, especially in context of contested </p>
<p>group identities. It is no wonder that the inltrators are cause of disruptions </p>
