<p>was cleansed of sin (i.e., through baptism) now fails to embody the virtues </p>
<p>which should otherwise be present in all whose sins are forgiven. </p>
<p>Finally, having articulated the dangers inherent in the failure to retain </p>
<p>the saving knowledge the author switches to some encouragement. He </p>
<p>shis from injunction to exhortation and addresses the community as adel-</p>
<p>phoi (brothers, siblings), a common Christian reference to fellow believers </p>
<p>that appeals to a ctive kinship of the church. Here 2 Peter, like Paul, refers </p>
<p>to the community he is addressing as adelphoi, literally brothers, but more </p>
<p>accurately understood as siblings, and therefore the NRSVs rendering of </p>
<p>brothers and sisters since there were women in the community. Some-</p>
<p>times touted as unique to Christianity,</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>the application of ctive kinship</p>
<p>language, where family language is used to describe the relationship among </p>
<p>the members of the community who are not biologically related, has been </p>
<p>shown to be a common characteristic in Greco-Roman associations and </p>
<p>groups.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since the family formed the nexus of a person’s instructional life, it </p>
<p>makes sense that groups sought to embody a family-like atmosphere that </p>
<p>provided the kind of close kinship-like relationships, especially if, as it was </p>
<p>commonly the case, one was excommunicated from his/her family of birth </p>
<p>for converting to Christianity. It was a vital way of group identity formation </p>
that allowed for otherwise unrelated individuals to nd common ground
<p>to relate in familial terms. So, by calling them siblings, the author of 2 Peter </p>
<p>seeks to reassure the community that the familial bond units them rmly </p>
<p>together with Christ, through whom they become children of God (2:17).</p>
<p>e familial metaphor may also explain the theological terms of call-</p>
<p>ing and election that the author uses next to describe the community’s sta-</p>
<p>tus in relationship to God. Just like one is born into a family as a result of </p>
<p>parental decision, believers can also be described as having been called and </p>
<p>chosen by God (the heavenly parent) to become members of the spiritual </p>
<p>family that is the Petrine community. A return to calling and election here, </p>
<p>in v. 10, without doubt harks back to v. 2, where the author talks about the </p>
<p>calling and election that comes via the received faith. </p>
<p>As such, the virtues list is encapsulated within the framework of God’s </p>
<p>calling and election of the community as recipients of God’s honor and shar-</p>
ers of the divine nature. By means of their honored status, the virtues pro-vide the guidelines wherewith this honor granted by divine determination
