<p>Fusing the Horizons: Empty Eloquence versus Faithful Preaching </p>
<p>130</p>
<p>Over emphasis on bombastic preaching has the danger of overlooking </p>
<p>the faults of the speakers, of misleading people who are not well grounded in </p>
<p>the faith, and also promoting pride in the preacher for thinking him/herself </p>
<p>better than others. Today, some of the most gifted preachers/speakers end up </p>
<p>on television, with its inevitable complications of TV ministry. Over the years </p>
<p>we have witnessed televangelists ensnared by fame and fortune, pride, greed, </p>
<p>sexual sin, false doctrines, self–delusion, corruption, etc., because everyone </p>
<p>mainly paid attention on their preaching and not on how they lived their lives. </p>
<p>It is not surprising that the TV in many African countries is ﬁlled with </p>
<p>prosperity gospel preachers whose message scarcely coheres to the message </p>
<p>of 2 Peter’s for self-sacriﬁce and self-discipline (1:5–7).</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>The false-teachers’</p>
<p>lives may have mirrored their preaching, but their preaching was built on the </p>
<p>wrong foundation (v. 19). They advocated a form of freedom that ultimately </p>
<p>only leads to enslavement to corruption, greed, and licentiousness. </p>
<p>Ultimately, even “golden mouth,” for all his giftedness, could not escape </p>
<p>the pitfall of espousing hate speeches that would become the foundation for </p>
<p>Christian anti–semiticism. The ﬂowery, but ultimately deceptive, speeches of </p>
<p>the false-teachers no doubt were having a major pull on 2 Peter’s audience, </p>
<p>and were the primary occasion for the writing of this letter aimed at exposing </p>
<p>their dishonesty.</p>
<p>The Danger of Apostasy (2:20–22)</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>For, if they escape the pollution of the world through the knowl-</p>
<p>edge of our lord and savior Jesus Christ, but again get entangled </p>
<p>[and] overpowered by it, in the end they are worse o than in the </p>
<p>beginning. </p>
<p>21</p>
<p>For it is better for them if they had not known the </p>
<p>way of righteousness and then turned back from the command-</p>
<p>ments delivered to them. </p>
<p>22</p>
<p>It has happened to them according to </p>
<p>the proverbs, “A dog returns to its vomit” and “A pig is bathed only </p>
<p>to wallow in the mud.” </p>
<p>60. I am aware of studies that have correctly pointed out that prosperity gospel partly </p>
<p>nds fertile ground in Africa because of the prevalence of the cosmological outlook that </p>
<p>emphasizes the present over the future, and the African religious outlook that empha-</p>
<p>sizes the religious “fullness of life” in the present rather than the future. is may be </p>
<p>partly in reaction to colonial missionary emphasis on a Gospel of futuristic heavenly </p>
<p>reward at the expense of the present reality. Cf. Ogbu Kalu 2008: 4–5.</p>
