<p>Jude 3–4</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>things have ceased and all things are made new, and we can no longer regard </p>
<p>each other on the basis of blood (ﬂesh) (2 Cor 5:16–17). </p>
<p>What seems like a subtle and somewhat insigniﬁcant move by Jude thus </p>
<p>turns out to be a most crucial element that converts to Christianity must </p>
<p>emulate. This was what the rest of the Kenyan church community’s reac-</p>
<p>tion evidenced, as it led the mobilization of assistance for all the displaced </p>
<p>victims of the violence, irrespective of tribal or religious afﬁliation, and sought </p>
<p>to establish a Truth and Reconciliation commission.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>True Christian identity</p>
<p>should incorporate and transform, without eradicating, all other forms of iden-</p>
<p>tity one may possess.</p>
<p>Contending for the Inherited Faith, Against Infiltrators </p>
<p>(vv. 3–4)</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Beloved, I am earnestly making this writing to you concerning </p>
<p>the common salvation we share, being compelled to write you and </p>
<p>encourage/urge you to contend for the faith handed down to the </p>
<p>saints/holy ones, once for all. </p>
<p>Jude uses an endearing term, beloved (also in v. 17 and v. 20), to address </p>
<p>his readers as a way of either identifying an already close relationship with </p>
<p>them, or perhaps in an attempt to seeking that closer tie. In terms of ancient </p>
<p>rhetoric, this is his establishment of an ethos (trustworthy character) that </p>
<p>should then establish his credibility to be able to address his audience with </p>
<p>authority.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> is is in-keeping with early Christian communities to con-</p>
<p>struct their communities as “families” with ctive kingship (1 Cor 4:14; 2 </p>
<p>Cor 7:1; Phil 4:1; 1, 2, 3 John; 1 Peter 2, etc.). He elaborates this further with </p>
<p>his reference to the shared bond of salvation (koinos soteria) in order to es-</p>
<p>tablish, without doubt, whose side he is on. is would be vital especially if, </p>
<p>as we reckon, the audience may be of Gentile origin while Jude is Jewish.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While it reects a warm regard for his audience, it stands in stark contrast </p>
<p>to his strong vilication of the opponents later in vv. 5–9. </p>

<p>(salvation) in Jewish monotheism verses Hellenistic piety.</p>
