<p>Introduction to Jude and 2 Peter</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>century), Tertullian (second century), Jerome (fourth century), Dydimus </p>
<p>of Alexandria (fourth century) all point out to the questioning raised about </p>
<p>its use of 1 Enoch, but nevertheless defend this use even to the point of </p>
<p>arguing for recognition of 1 Enoch as Scripture. Against this argument, Au-</p>
<p>gustine (fourth century), while accepting Jude as authentic, argued against </p>
<p>1 Enoch’s acceptance as he recognized it to be pseudepigraphical.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Arguments for pseudepigraphical authorship of Jude only gained </p>
<p>prominence largely following the rise of the German biblical interpretation </p>
<p>in the mid-nineteenth century, especially following the work of F. C. Baur </p>
<p>and the Tübingen school who argued for a late date of the book’s authorship </p>
<p>than had traditionally been assumed. e basis of this argument was pri-</p>
<p>marily an assumption that the letter of Jude (and 2 Peter) evidenced “early </p>
<p>Catholic” teachings that focused less on eschatological expectations and </p>
<p>more on establishing long term Christian communities. While grouping </p>
<p>writings together under a common theme, such as early Catholic, may be </p>
<p>useful in highlighting similarities in such works, it unfortunately also has </p>
the tendency to obscure and eradicate the individual characteristics of each
<p>writing in the group. Combined with this was the perception that Jude’s </p>
<p>opponents exemplied Gnostic tendencies in beliefs; available evidence, </p>
<p>however, suggests that Gnosticism as a theological teaching did not exist </p>
<p>until the second century CE. </p>
<p>Bauckham made it clear that the “early Catholic” classication was in-</p>
<p>consistent with the letter’s internal evidence including a strong eschatologi-</p>
<p>cal nature (14–15), his classication of the letter as what he calls “a Jewish </p>
<p>midrash” (which reects a Jewish Palestinian provenance for the letter), and </p>
<p>the lack of a record of Church oces such as elders, deacons or bishops.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ese factors, among others, convinced Bauckham that the benet of the </p>
<p>doubt lies with those who maintain the authenticity of Jude while the bur-</p>
<p>den of proof is with those who think otherwise. Davids concurs, and aer </p>
<p>a lengthy analysis of the evidence nds that “. . . none of the explanations </p>
<p>why someone would use Jude as a pseudonym is convincing.”</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>It therefore</p>
<p>makes more sense to maintain the authenticity of the Jude in this regard.</p>
