<p>Fusing the Horizons: Dangers of Stereotyping</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>and perpetuate a stereotype of racism and its denigration of people of dark </p>
<p>skinned peoples, they did so while ﬁnding support in the Bible – justifying </p>
<p>both slavery and colonialism of Africans on such “biblical” premise. The post </p>
<p>colonial African nations have struggled to ﬁnd their own identity in the midst </p>
<p>of such foundations, a reality perhaps epitomized by the Rwandan genocide </p>
<p>of 1994.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>It is reported that during the Rwanda genocide (a country of 10%</p>
<p>African religions practitioners, 20% Protestants and 70% Catholics), the one </p>
<p>way that the perpetrators of genocide would bring themselves to slaughter </p>
<p>their Tutsi brothers and sisters was to use stereotypical language by referring </p>
<p>to them as “cockroaches” (inyenzi in Kinyarwanda).</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>Dehumanizing fellow</p>
<p>human beings as such played a signiﬁcant role in blinding the perpetrators </p>
<p>of violence.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> It is thus very disturbing when I read 2 Peter 2:12’s character-</p>
<p>ization of the opponents as “wild beast ﬁt for slaughter” (see also 2:18-22 </p>
<p>where they are compared to dogs and pigs).</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>Whenever one group of humans</p>
<p>has sought to justify annihilation of its enemy, it has sought to downplay the </p>
<p>humanity of the Other. Much as I have struggled to put 2 Peter in its larger </p>
<p>Greco-Roman perspective, I have found it still too jarring to fully justify use of </p>
<p>such language of “slaughter,” even when it is attributed to God in reference to </p>
<p>the ﬁnal eschatological judgment.</p>
<p>Unreliability of the False-Teachers (2:17–19)</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>ese are waterless springs and mists blown by a storm, which </p>
<p>are kept for the gloomy darkness. </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>For with high sounding and </p>
<p>empty speech and with unrestrained eshly desires, they bait </p>
<p>those who very recently escaped from those who conduct/live </p>
<p>their lives in error.</p>
<p> 19</p>
<p>ey promise freedom, but they themselves </p>
<p>remain slaves of corruption. For whatever one is mastered by, to </p>
<p>that is one enslaved! e obvious contrast here is between freedom </p>
<p>and slavery. </p>
<p>52. J. Semujanga 2003: 39. “. . . the logic of genocide did not exist in traditional so-</p>
<p>cieties of Africa. e genocide of one group is in fact possible only where modern state </p>
<p>structures exist, because only these give to political power an ecient control of the </p>
<p>population.”</p>

<p>54. Semujanga 2003: 189. “It was as if the further the stereotype got from reality, the </p>
<p>more it fed foolish fantasies on the harmfulness of ‘the other.’”</p>
