<p>2 Peter 2:9–11</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>lence in Gen 19:9 is suggested as a more likely background, which may also </p>
<p>be symptomatic of an aggressive nature of false-teachers.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e only diculty with such a reading is that, the torture in 2 Peter is </p>
<p>explained as happening in his righteous soul (psychēs dikaiaos). Nonethe-</p>
<p>less, if we do understand psychē to refer to the whole person, for example </p>
<p>like in 1 Pet 3:20, then such a reading would stand. An alternative explana-</p>
<p>tion, however, has posited the possible use of an LXX variant.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>e LXX</p>
<p>variant reading seems to suggest a plausible background of 2 Peter’s under-</p>
<p>standing of Lot as being troubled by sin, and on those grounds could be </p>
<p>pronounced righteous.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ultimately, the pattern of judgment and rescue is, clearly, what gov-</p>
<p>erns the examples that 2 Peter selects from the Hebrew Scriptures. Just like </p>
<p>Noah’s case in the previous example, Lot’s biblical context is also a case </p>
where there is a complete destruction of an entire community, in divine
<p>judgment for sin, save for a very small group of survivors who are rescued. </p>
<p>One wonders then whether the author of 2 Peter is convinced that the ma-</p>
<p>jority of the Petrine community is in danger of destruction or he simply </p>
<p>wants to paint a picture of the certainty of God’s judgment against sin, even </p>
<p>if it means using rhetoric that implies the total annihilation of a majority of </p>
<p>the group. Moreover, if we understand it in terms of the author identifying </p>
himself as a prophet (1:19–21), then the urgency of divine judgment on
<p>entire nations and peoples in the Hebrew Bible was always tempered by </p>
<p>the promise of the rescue of a faithful minority. is then is the pattern of </p>
<p>prophetic speech that is being reected here.</p>
<p>Guarantee of Divine Judgment in the Present (2:9–11)</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>e Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trial and to keep </p>
<p>the unrighteous in punishment until the Day of Judgment. </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>And, </p>
<p>especially those who walk in the esh—in polluting lust, who de-</p>
<p>spise lordship; arrogant and self-pleasing, they are not afraid to </p>
<p>blaspheme the glorious ones. </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Whereas angels, even though with </p>
<p>greater strength and power, do not bring against themselves rail-</p>
<p>ing judgment from the Lord. </p>
