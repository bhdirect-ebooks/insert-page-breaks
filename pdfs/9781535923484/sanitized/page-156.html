<p>2 Peter 3:1–2</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>Other possibilities suggested for the rst letter include Jude (J. A. T. </p>
<p>Robinson) or a lost letter (M. Green), both of which have failed to gain </p>
<p>traction among scholars.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Jude would make sense as a background since</p>
<p>most of 2 Peter 2 and sections of 2 Peter 3 (2, 3, 14, 18) draw heavily on </p>
<p>Jude. However, there is no textual source that attributes the letter of Jude to </p>
<p>Peter. And, given 2 Peter makes some signicant reworking of Jude’s mate-</p>
<p>rial by omitting certain references and reconstructing some sentences it </p>
<p>would make for an awkward pointer. e mention of the rst letter seems </p>
<p>calculated to not only show the closeness of the author with the intended </p>
<p>audience but also to arm that the things he says nd support in the earlier </p>
<p>letter as well. </p>
<p>e connection to 1 Peter is not, however, a secure one given that, </p>
<p>with the exception of a shared eschatological outlook (1 Pet 4:7 and 2 Pet </p>
<p>3:14), 2 Peter hardly uses 1 Peter at all.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>As early as the Patristic period,</p>
<p>there was already recognition of dierences in style between the letters, </p>
<p>which originated the questioning of 2 Peter’s authenticity.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ere are those who may argue that 2 Pet 3:1 is the beginning of a </p>
<p>new letter, the second, with the rst having ended with chapter two.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>While</p>
<p>plausible, the idea of chapter three starting a new letter does not have any </p>
<p>manuscript support since all ancient manuscripts that we have of 2 Peter </p>
<p>are complete, ending with chapter three.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2 Peter’s claim that in both letters he has sought to stir up/awaken </p>
<p>(diegerō) your remembrance (hypomnēsis), need not be taken to fully rep-</p>
<p>resent the contents of both letters, resulting in disqualication of 1 Peter </p>
<p>as a plausible candidate here.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Rather it has to be understood as reference</p>
<p>to issues that the audience has already been introduced to, but which now </p>
<p>are in danger of being either ignored or forgotten in the midst of the perni-</p>
<p>cious inuence of the false-teachers. Since it is “purity of thought” (eilikrinē </p>
<p>dianoia) that he seeks to reawaken them to, one must see in this the call </p>
<p>to ethical purity already outlined in the previous reference to the virtuous </p>
<p>conduct (1:5–7). </p>
