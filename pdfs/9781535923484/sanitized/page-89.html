<p>Salutations and Bestowing of Honor on Readers</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>e assumption usually stated in commentaries, with no defense, </p>
<p>that Sumeon indicates an early Palestinian or Hebraic version of the name </p>
<p>Simon and thus an indication of a more “ancient” provenance has been re-</p>
<p>cently challenged by J. Hultin.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Hultin has argued that the name Sumeon,</p>
<p>is simply the name of the OT patriarch and not a more ancient version of </p>
<p>Simon. Some of the manuscripts have the Hellenized Simon (B ψ) which, </p>
<p>according to Hultin, is not just the more commonly occurring version in </p>
<p>the NT but may also be the more ancient one.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>e letter is addressed to those equally honored (isotimon) to receive </p>
<p>the faith with the author identifying himself as an “equal” with those he is </p>
<p>writing to, since he like them, is simply a recipient of God’s grace. is iden-</p>
<p>tication with an important presumed eyewitness to Jesus’ earthly ministry </p>
<p>(1:17–18) does two things—elevates the readers to the same level as the eye </p>
<p>witness, and equates the two in the eyes of God, the source of all honor. It </p>
<p>also sets up the honor list of virtues in vv. 4–5 which are the means and </p>
<p>measure of honor for the community. </p>
<p>In the rst-century Mediterranean world, a person’s status was deter-</p>
<p>mined by the honor (timē) attributed to him or her; while, on the other </p>
<p>hand, losing honor or being shamed was to be avoided at every cost. Honor </p>
<p>is a public recognition that could be attained by birth, good deeds, kindness </p>
<p>to others, leadership, wealth, status, or good reputation.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Honor was a rare</p>
<p>commodity and, therefore, sought aer by all. Within Greco-Roman as-</p>
<p>sociations, benefaction (Greek)/patronage (Latin) involved the exchange of </p>
“good deeds” (determined by each individual group) in exchange for honor
<p>(timē).</p>
<p>5</p>
Given that honor, both individual and group, was understood as a
<p>limited and scarce commodity in society, desire to attain it meant that there </p>
<p>was constant competition for its acquisition which, on occasion, would </p>
<p>spur rivalry in contesting groups with each group claiming greater honor </p>
<p>2. Claim made rst by Bigg (1901: 248), it has been referenced without support by </p>
<p>Schreiner 2001: 284. </p>
<p>3. J. Hultin SBL 2013: In an email sent to me states: “Contrary to what folks have been </p>
<p>saying for 200 years, Συμεων is not the ‘palestinian’ or the ‘hebraic’ form of the name. To </p>
<p>the contrary, Σιμων is the more palestinian, indeed the more ‘ancient’ form of the name. </p>
<p>Συμεων is above all the name used for the Patriarch.”</p>

5. Harland 2009: 148. e individual groups determined the denition of “good
<p>deeds”, though many groups shared aspects of what this entailed.</p>
