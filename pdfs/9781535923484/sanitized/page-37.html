<p>Introduction to Jude and 2 Peter</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>been written by a dierent secretary giving the distinctive styles.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While a linguistic analysis shows that 2 Peter follows an “Asiatic style </p>
<p>of writing” with an Aramaic thought background,</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>it is generally</p>
<p>agreed that the sizes of both letters are not large enough to warrant </p>
<p>sucient proof of dierence.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>ese make reasonable explanation to</p>
<p>the dierences between the letters.</p>
<p>2. Dependence on Jude whose earliest plausible date is 60–70 CE. e ear-</p>
<p>liest the letter of Jude would have been completed is between 60 CE </p>
<p>and 70 CE. us, 2 Peter must be later since it contains a majority of </p>
<p>Jude. And if Jude’s provenance is Palestine and 2 Peter’s is Rome, we </p>
<p>must allow for a period of time for Jude to get to Rome for the author </p>
<p>of 2 Peter to be familiar with it. A plausible response here is that 2 Pe-</p>
<p>ter was written not too long aer Jude’s letter which 2 Peter’s audience </p>
<p>were not familiar with. So the author of 2 Peter would have a copy of </p>
<p>the letter, but his audience would not know that it exists and that is </p>
<p>why he nds no problem both quoting it extensively and also altering </p>
<p>its content for his audience. However, a further objection would be, </p>
<p>if this is Peter’s letter why does he nd the need to copy Jude’s letter </p>
<p>so extensively? If as many scholars are now convinced, Jude’s letter is </p>
<p>authentic from Jesus’ brother, then it would explain why Peter would </p>
<p>consider it signicant enough to replicate in his own letter.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>And as</p>
<p>has been shown, 2 Peter does not simply copy Jude, but has conscious-</p>
<p>ly utilized Jude and integrated Jude into his own arguments.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>3. Reference to the rst Christian generation as “fathers” falling asleep </p>
<p>(3:4), probably indicating they had already died by the time of its </p>
<p>writing, and thus unlikely to have been written by Peter. e term </p>
<p>“fathers,” however, was more commonly used in reference to biblical </p>
<p>ancestors rather than apostles (Heb 1:1; Rom 9:5).</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>Support of this</p>
<p>understanding also comes from the author’s response by referring to </p>
<p>55. Jerome Ep. Heb. 120.11. Rejection of this reasoning states that if the secretaries </p>
<p>had such freedom to construct the letters, then the letters cannot be rightfully called </p>
<p>Peter’s. However, this objection is driven by our modern understanding of authorship.</p>
<p>56. Green 1987: 23–26. is apparent use of Attic Greek style may also lend support </p>
<p>to a late dating of the letter.</p>
