<p>Introduction to Jude and 2 Peter</p>

<p>group-boundaries (who rightfully belongs to the Jesus community?). ese </p>
<p>are the issues at the heart of the construction of the virtues in 2 Peter 1:5–7, </p>
<p>and in the characterization of vices of the “false-teachers” and inltrators in </p>
<p>Jude. If the virtues represent the “good order,” for example, the list of vices </p>
<p>in 2 Peter 2, represent the dangerous inversions of this order.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When dealing with their opponents, both Jude and 2 Peter are there-</p>
<p>fore steeped in Greco-Roman rhetorical banter that regularly employed the </p>
<p>use of stock stereotyping when verbally jousting with known opponents. </p>
<p>Even the primary characterization of the opponents by 2 Peter as false-</p>
<p>teachers (pseudodidaskaloi), for example, must be tempered by the realiza-</p>
<p>tion that this is still part of the negative caricature of opponents that says </p>
<p>little, if anything, about whether they are actual teachers, and what they </p>
<p>actually teach, or even how they in fact behaved.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>It is largely an eort</p>
<p>to discredit the opponents and not necessarily intended to be an accurate </p>
<p>description of their teachings or behavior.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Banqueting Protocols in Associations and in Jude and 2 Peter </p>
<p>A second concern in association life was the place of decorum without </p>
<p>which the gathering would easily devolve into chaos, a not-so-unusual </p>
<p>result for many associations. erefore, regulations were frequently put in </p>
<p>place to guide behavior in the gatherings and heavy penalties meted against </p>
<p>any that would exhibit anti-decorum behavior, including excommunica-</p>
<p>tion from the group. As Harland explains:</p>
<p>Evidently, banqueting practices played an important role in </p>
<p>discourses of identity, in which certain authors, representative </p>
<p>in some ways of their cultural group, engaged in the process of </p>
<p>20. Harland in Smith and Taussig 2012: 73–86.</p>
<p>21. In contrast, for example, Bauckham’s (1983) discussion of the opponents in </p>
<p>Jude/2 Peter seems to take for granted the stereotypes as actual characterization of op-</p>
<p>ponents’ behavior upon which he then builds a portrait of them as itinerant teachers/</p>
<p>preachers (11–13).</p>
<p>22. Wisdom and Philo also use similar language to caricature non-Jews (Harland </p>
<p>2009: 177): “. . . we are witnessing the expression of Judean or Christian identities in </p>
<p>relation to the associations in a way that illustrates the internalization of external catego-</p>
<p>rizations…” e Psalms in the Hebrew Bible reect the tendency to use such rhetoric to </p>
discredit opponents, and calls for their divine destruction (e.g., Ps 3:7; 22:16, 20; 44:15;
<p>69:21–28; 143:12). </p>
