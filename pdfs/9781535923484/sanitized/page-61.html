<p>ree Examples of Divine Judgment of Ancient Israel, as Warnings</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>In Genesis 19 Sodom and Gomorrah got destroyed by re from the </p>
<p>heavens, yet for Jude, their punishment is eternal and has no end. Kelly </p>
<p>understands this statement to mean that the evidence of the judgment of </p>
<p>these cities is still there for anyone to “see and note with dread.”</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>Both</p>
<p>Wisdom of Solomon (10:7) and Philo (Vit. Mos. 2: 56) also support such an </p>
<p>understanding, with reference to the molten sulfur that continued to be </p>
<p>present in the locations thought to have been where these cities existed.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e shortcoming with both Philo and Wisdom in this perspective is that </p>
<p>the reference is to those judged, and who continue to suer, but not simply </p>
<p>the continuing presence of molten rocks in a particular site. Fire (puros) </p>
does two connected but divergent things—it destroys and it puries. It de-
<p>stroys the pollutant in judgment and at the same time, by getting rid of the </p>
<p>pollutant it, in eect, puries the remnant. </p>
<p>Is the central focus of Jude’s reference to Sodom and Gomorrah </p>
<p>primarily about sexual sin? In Genesis 19, the sexual sin that the men of </p>
<p>Sodom (not Gomorrah) are accused of is that of homosexuality as they </p>
<p>especially desired to have sexual intercourse with the angels who came to </p>
<p>the city. However, subsequent biblical reference to Sodom as a symbol of </p>
human sinfulness and divine judgment did not always focus on sexual sin.
<p>In Isa 3:9, the issue is with the shamelessness with which sin was commit-</p>
<p>ted by the Sodomites, while in Ezek 16:47–50, Jerusalem is accused of being </p>
<p>worse than Sodom whose primary guilt is listed as failure to take care of the </p>
<p>poor and needy, and committing “abominable things” before God. Jesus </p>
<p>portrays the nal consequences of any city that rejects the gospel message </p>
<p>as being worse that the fate of Sodom (Luke 10:12). While, 2 Pet 2:6, who </p>
<p>uses Jude as his source, shis the focus to judgment more specically.</p>
<p>In the same way, it cannot be simply assumed that Jude’s focus in ref-</p>
<p>erencing Sodom and Gomorrah is on the issue of homosexuality.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>Jude</p>
<p>describes as the course of their undoing to be following or lusting aer dif-</p>
<p>ferent/other esh (sarx heteros). And, as Kelly points out, homosexuality </p>
<p>is lusting aer the same esh, not dierent esh.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>As such, “dierent/other</p>
<p>esh” is to be possibly understood in two ways—1) reference to bestiality, </p>
<p>and/or 2) desiring the dierent esh of angels. In the former, it is unlikely </p>

<p>50. Wis. 10.7: “Evidence of their wickedness still remains: a continually smoking </p>
<p>wasteland, plants bearing fruit that does not ripen, and a pillar of salt standing as a </p>
<p>monument to an unbelieving soul.”</p>
