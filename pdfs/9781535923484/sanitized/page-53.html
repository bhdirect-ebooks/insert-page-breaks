<p>Arrival of Inltrators</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>Indications are that usually there was a strong guard among Greco-Roman </p>
<p>associations against what each group considered external meddlers or </p>
busybodies, who did not belong, with invocation of irrevocable divine
<p>punishment on such perpetrators.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> Similarly, in Jude, the condemna-</p>
tion of the inltrators involves declaration of immutable divine judgment
<p>(whose judgment was long ago/before written about). e appeal to this </p>
<p>judgment as having been pronounced long ago is Jude’s use of a rhetorical </p>
<p>device, which, in a society where the more ancient a claim was the more </p>
<p>respected, establishes authoritative grounds on which to build his case </p>
<p>against the inltrators.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>It is also a way of establishing credibility with his</p>
<p>audience, that while the case he brings against the inltrators may be im-</p>
mediate, it nevertheless nds support in ancient divine pronouncements
<p>against them (v. 14). </p>
<p>e language of stealth (pareisduō) here conjures a scenario where </p>
<p>the enemy manages to inltrate the camp and, like the Trojan horse tactic, </p>
<p>fans out among the unsuspecting enemy wrecking havoc from within. e </p>
<p>inltrators come in a guise, and only later is their true form revealed. is </p>
<p>echoes the scene in Gal 2:4, where the opponents are identied as Juda-</p>
<p>izers who claimed to arrive with blessing from the leaders in Jerusalem </p>
<p>and inltrated the Galatian church. Paul describes them as inltrating into </p>
<p>the community of the Galatian gentile-Christians, accusing them of spying </p>
<p>on his freedom, with the intent of imposing on the Galatians the bondage </p>
<p>of the law of circumcision. Paul goes on to lay out arguments that show </p>
<p>the contrasting understanding of what freedom in Christ entails for him in </p>
<p>contrast to that of the Judaizers, with whom he is at loggerheads. </p>
<p>Unlike Paul, who does lay out clearly what the Judaizers were advocat-</p>
<p>ing for before refuting their teachings, point by point, Jude seems to prefer </p>
<p>to generally stereotype and caricature the inltrators using stalk language </p>
<p>found in Greco-Romans writings to typecast enemies.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> If that understand-</p>
<p>ing holds, it would mean that it is unlikely to determine with any precision </p>
<p>what the teachings of the inltrators in Jude may have been. is diculty </p>
<p>of pinning down exactly what their teachings were makes it complicated, if </p>
<p>not impossible, to determine with any accuracy the philosophical or theo-</p>
<p>logical group the inltrators in Jude may have belonged to. </p>

<p>dles will incur sin against Men Tyrannos that cannot be expiated.”</p>
