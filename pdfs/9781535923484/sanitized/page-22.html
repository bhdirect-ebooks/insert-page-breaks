<p>Introduction to Jude and 2 Peter</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>volumes or stand-alone monographs, of specic aspects of the letters, or </p>
<p>edited volumes. Needless to say then, the question of whether to write </p>
<p>another commentary is indeed a genuine one, and one that I hope I can </p>
<p>justify in this particular case. Even with this surge in publications, there </p>
<p>have hardly been any works in the area that have sought to tap the meth-</p>
odological, theological, and cultural diversity that has been necessitated
<p>into the Biblical Studies discipline by postmodernism (Aichele 2012 is an </p>
<p>exception). Hopefully, my maiden attempt in this commentary to integrate </p>
<p>postcolonial readings will pave the way for more research that highlights </p>
the diversity of the discipline.
<p>Commentaries in Biblical Studies, for the large part, have remained the </p>
<p>domain of Euro-American white male commentators who over the years </p>
<p>have directed their inquiries of the Bible to matters they deem relevant to </p>
<p>the text. Unfortunately, these were driven and constrained by the particular </p>
concerns of these individuals’ Euro-American worldviews, cultures, reli-
<p>gious avors, and positions of power, authority and privilege. Mostly, these </p>
<p>a priori concerns were unacknowledged, and even when they were, these </p>
<p>commentators assumed their views to be universal and representative of all </p>
<p>of humanity. Since the western culture has been dominant in world aairs, </p>
<p>and has cast its inuence over many dierent parts of the globe through </p>
<p>colonialism and other forms of foreign occupations, the western authors </p>
<p>have tended to assume that they spoke for all peoples or that their interpre-</p>
<p>tations captured all a text could say. </p>
<p>is rather myopic perspective on interpretation has meant that west-</p>
<p>ern scholars have controlled the discourse in Biblical Studies and have set </p>
the agendas and questions to be addressed, oblivious to the diversity and
<p>dierence that readers from dierent cultures would bring to the interpre-</p>
<p>tive process. e advent of postmodernism, has cast a long shadow on this </p>
<p>form of thinking, making it plain that the role of the author/interpreter </p>
<p>is never neutral, and that all knowledge is the product of the speaker’s </p>
<p>background, upbringing, culture, gender, wealth, language, privilege or </p>
<p>lack thereof, power both political and social. erefore, one cannot claim </p>
<p>to speak for “all” people. is is also true of the writing of commentaries. </p>
<p>ey represent the writers’ points of view, shaped and inuenced by their </p>
<p>background—cultural, historical, social, economic, educational, etc. One </p>
