<p>Introduction to Jude and 2 Peter</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Arguments against Petrine authorship have continued to persist, but </p>
<p>comprehensive (if not fully convincing) answers to each objection have </p>
<p>been provided. e alternative theory of pseudepigraphy also has its own </p>
<p>gaping holes making each side’s position, on the one hand plausible and, </p>
<p>on the other, still inconclusive. Of all the concerns for the pseudepigraphy </p>
<p>arguments, I still believe the moral issue is probably the most challenging </p>
<p>to account for. Nonetheless, as Witherington III points out, our modern </p>
<p>notion of authorship may be too narrow to accommodate the plausible fact </p>
<p>found in his own proposal of 2 Peter as a form of “sapiental literature” where </p>
<p>scribal editing of writings was done communally allowing for a composite </p>
<p>writing to be craed by scribes, from original kernels and other sources.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is would allow for aspects of the letter to have originated with the Peter </p>
<p>but with subsequent accretions over time, much in the same way that 2 </p>
<p>Peter itself has incorporated the letter of Jude. </p>
<p>While advancing the concept of authorship, Witherington III’s argu-</p>
<p>ment does not preclude a diculty of the time-frame of a purported writer’s </p>
<p>death vis-a-vis his/her own writing. For instance, most pseudepigraphon </p>
<p>were documents penned hundreds of years aer the deaths of those to </p>
<p>whom those documents were attributed (i.e., Testament of the Twelve Patri-</p>
<p>archs, Assumption of Moses). And the audience would have been aware of </p>
<p>that fact, versus the so-called NT pseudepigrapha which would be penned </p>
<p>several years aer the purported author’s death inevitably raising suspicion </p>
<p>of authorship. Of course, this would be resolved if we accepted Bauckham’s </p>
<p>testamentary genre which, however, as we have noted and will elaborate </p>
<p>further below and in the commentary, has its own shortcomings. Also, it is </p>
<p>one thing if such a writing appeared soon aer the writer’s death versus, say, </p>
<p>twenty or thirty years later, the time-frame suggested by Bauckham’s dating </p>
<p>of the letter (80–90 CE) from the death of Peter.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So where are we le aer all this? I am still not convinced by the </p>
<p>pseudepigraphical arguments for authorship, as it seems to me that there </p>
<p>are signicant unanswered concerns over it.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>At the very least, even the</p>
<p>primary accusation that 2 Peter itself levies against its opponents—what </p>
<p>72. Witherington III 2007: 269–70.</p>
<p>73. Bauckham 1983: 158.</p>
<p>74. See Green (1987: 40–48) for a detailed presentation of the concerns with pseude-</p>
<p>pigraphy in 2 Peter. Peter H. Davids (2006: 149) seems to come to an impasse, conclud-</p>
<p>ing that there is no way of proving “from historical investigation” whether the Simeon </p>
<p>Peter in the salutations is the disciple or a pseudepigrapher.</p>
