<p>their rst century setting, for they seem to t quite well into the category </p>
<p>of these associations. Comparisons of structure, language, and practices </p>
<p>between associations and Jude and 2 Peter imply a world where borrowing </p>
<p>was common and puts in new relief certain features of these New Testa-</p>
<p>ment writings. </p>
<p>at is why the editors of this New Covenant Commentary Series </p>
<p>have sought to put together a commentary series that is as internation-</p>
<p>ally representative as it is possible, in order to allow dierent voices, from </p>
<p>dierent parts of the world to air their thought about how they read and </p>
<p>understand the New Testament. </p>
<p>Communities Of Jude And 2 Peter As Greco-Roman </p>
<p>Associations</p>
<p>Beyond family gatherings, associations were the most common unocial </p>
<p>community gatherings in antiquity.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> ey formed around common inter-</p>
<p>ests such as funeral guilds, labor groups, etc., and most involved regular </p>
<p>informal gatherings that included meals, fraternizing and drinking. Philip </p>
<p>Harland denes associations thus:</p>
<p>In broad terms, associations, synagogues, and congregations were </p>
<p>small, non-compulsory groups that could draw their membership </p>
<p>from several possible social network connections within civic </p>
<p>settings. All could be either relatively homogeneous or heteroge-</p>
<p>neous with regard to social and gender composition; all engaged </p>
<p>in regular meetings that involved a variety of interconnected so-</p>
<p>cial, ritual, and other purposes, one group diering from the next </p>
<p>in the specics of activities; all depended in various ways upon </p>
<p>commonly accepted social conventions such as benefaction for </p>
<p>nancial support (e.g., a meeting-place) and the development of </p>
<p>leadership structures; and all could engage in at least some degree </p>
<p>of external contacts, both positive and negative, with other indi-</p>
<p>viduals, benefactors, groups or institutions in the civic context.</p>

<p>In a subsequent study, Harland points out that these gathering were as much </p>
<p>about socializing as they were about honoring benefactors, both human </p>
and divine. As such, the modern distinction made between social and reli-
<p>gious aspects of associations is patently mistaken, and that “all associations </p>
