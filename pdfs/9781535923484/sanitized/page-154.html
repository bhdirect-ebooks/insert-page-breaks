<p>Fusing the Horizons: Apostasy versus Election</p>

<p>joyous conversion to the faith but got entangled by the cares of this world and </p>
<p>abandoned the faith (Mark 4:16–17). </p>
<p>Without the possibility of apostasy, the encouragement to strive to keep </p>
<p>the commands (1:5—“master every effort . . .”) and warnings to be, careful </p>
<p>about being waylaid by the false-teachers, would not be meaningful. If how-</p>
<p>ever, one was to simply focus on the two proverbs cited by the author (“A dog </p>
<p>returns to its vomit” and “A pig is bathed only to wallow in the mud.”), one may </p>
<p>be left with the impression that these were not real converts. Therefore, the </p>
<p>proverbs do not provide a theological stand but are meant as rhetorical punch </p>
<p>lines to denigrate the false-teachers for their actions. </p>
