<p>2 Peter 1:5–11</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>in Greco-Roman associations typically related to one’s dedication to the </p>
<p>gods.</p>
<p>33</p>
However, it was also used a descriptor of divine power similar to the
<p>way it is used here in 2 Peter.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Arêtē (virtue), eusebeia (godliness), doxa (glory) are also common </p>
<p>ascriptions on epigraphs for people honored in Greco-Roman associations. </p>
<p>It is virtue as a mark of moral uprightness and distinctiveness, which would </p>
<p>also make reasonable sense in the way it is listed here in 2 Peter. at is </p>
<p>why regarding the issue of godly nature imbued from God, through our </p>
<p>relationship with Jesus, does not guarantee attributes that are in and of </p>
<p>themselves godly but simply allows the community to strive towards those </p>
<p>attributes with every eort, aware that they share in the nature of God. </p>
<p>Apparently, becoming a partaker of godliness does not automatically </p>
<p>transform one’s sense of commitment toward virtues, since the expectation </p>
<p>is that there will be exertion of one’s every eort (mastering every eort) to </p>
<p>inculcate in oneself these honorable character building elements, through </p>
<p>knowledge (gnosis). </p>
<p>As Wayne Meeks points out, virtues were redened in the Christian </p>
context relative to the community as opposed to the individual focus in
<p>philosophy.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> is is not just any knowledge but it points back to the spe-</p>
<p>cic knowledge described earlier, of God (v. 2) through Jesus, which leads </p>
<p>to godliness. e expected outcome by the author of 2 Peter is that the </p>
<p>community will succeed, having already conrmed to them that they can </p>
<p>become partakers of God’s nature (v. 4). erefore, the promise is that </p>
<p>these things will ourish in the believers (or among believers) resulting </p>
<p>from their full and accurate knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. If this is </p>
the case, then the exertion here expected is not individualistic eort but
<p>group-oriented drive. e supporting evidence is that exhortation in this </p>
<p>section is in second person plural in the Greek, meaning the author is ad-</p>
<p>dressing the group eort to make sure that, as a group, these virtues are a </p>
<p>living reality. </p>
<p>e virtue that follows is self-control (enkrateia). According to a le<span class="_ _1" />ad-</p>
<p>ing lexicon, enkrateia translated as self-control, also implies “. . . restraint of </p>
<p>one’s emotions, impulses, or desires…” and is found only a few other times </p>
<p>in the NT (Acts 24:25; Gal 5:23; 1 Pet 1:6 [twice]).</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>It is also found in other</p>
<p>33. For example, AGRW 74 = IGLSkythia III 44. </p>
