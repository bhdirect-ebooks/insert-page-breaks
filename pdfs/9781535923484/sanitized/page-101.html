<p>Virtues at Govern e Godly Life</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>knowledge of God through Jesus Christ that makes this list of virtues </p>
more than philanthropos. It is this aspect of divine foundation as the prem-
<p>ise of practicing of virtues that distinguishes 2 Peter’s virtues from similar </p>
<p>Hellenistic virtue lists, like those of Stoics, whose emphasis is on the per-</p>
<p>formance of the virtue as an end in itself.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>is framework of virtues built</p>
<p>on faith but structured by epignosis (knowledge) (1:5), ultimately leads </p>
<p>to a very specic form of gnosis—that of Jesus Christ the Lord! is type </p>
<p>of knowledge is premised on revealed truth (tē parousē álitheia—1:12), </p>
meaning its origin is not human, but divine. e pinnacle of the progressive
<p>and cumulative list, while admonished as what one should strive for, clearly </p>
<p>originated from faith in God and leads to the saving knowledge of Jesus </p>
<p>Christ. </p>
<p>e concern in 2 Peter is with group dynamics, which play a crucial </p>
<p>role in bearing witness to outsiders about the nature of the Petrine group. </p>
<p>For this reason, the author is convinced that the cultivation of these virtues </p>
<p>is what would help dene the identity of the group vis-á-vis the rest of so-</p>
<p>ciety. is concern is shared with Greco-Roman associations which strove </p>
<p>primarily to inculcate a given structure of discipline that would result in </p>
<p>“mutual respect, order and decorum” among its membership. In such as-</p>
<p>sociations, breaking the group’s statutes resulted in some form of penalty </p>
<p>including nes, and even expulsions.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>And, although similar concerns may</p>
<p>be shared with the larger society, the distinguishing feature for the Petrine </p>
<p>community is that the knowledge of God through Jesus Christ is the foun-</p>
<p>dation that governs their ethics. </p>
<p>If the virtue list is to encourage community growth and a sense of </p>
<p>communal identity, then the danger envisioned by the author of 2 Peter is </p>
<p>one where inactivity and unfruitfulness (akarpous) regarding the listed </p>
<p>virtues, stunts spiritual growth, allowing the community to be a prime </p>
<p>targets of those bringing in false teachings. Just like the incremental build-</p>
<p>ing of the virtues in vv. 5–7, any state of stagnation seems to be viewed as </p>
<p>hazardous by the author as it would mean failure to reach the stated goal of </p>
<p>full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

<p>43. Example from Liopesi (Attica, Greece and Macedonia) AGRW 8 = IG II² 1369 </p>
<p>(ca. 100 CE). “May the club increase because of the zealousness of its members! But if </p>
<p>anyone of those should be seen where ghting or disturbances occur, he shall be expelled </p>
<p>from the club, being ned twenty-ve Attic drachmas or being punished with double the </p>
<p>blows in addition to judgment (?).”</p>
