<p>Introduction to Jude and 2 Peter</p>

<p>pointed inquiry in 3:11 (“Given that all things will dissolved, what </p>
<p>kind of lives ought you to live?”), driven by eschatological concerns.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>7. Identifying 2 Peter as a “Testament” genre, has been used as grounds </p>
<p>on which to argue that it is pseudepigraphical just like other Testa-</p>
<p>mentary writings.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>While this argument has been well developed by</p>
<p>Bauckham and is widely accepted by scholars, it has signicant weak-</p>
<p>nesses. In fact, as I will argue below in the commentary, you can have </p>
<p>testamentary material in a piece of writing, without converting the </p>
<p>entire document into a “Testament.”</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>Also, 2 Peter does not follow</p>
<p>all the conventions of a Testamentary writing.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>A strong argument</p>
<p>against pseudeipgraphical authorship is the early church’s vigilant </p>
<p>censorship of the canonical writings as they determined what to in-</p>
<p>clude in the Bible. Writings deemed to be inauthentic were eliminated </p>
<p>from contention, irrespective of their teachings. We know for example </p>
<p>other writings written in the name of Peter, such as Gospel of Peter, </p>
<p>were rejected as pseudepigraphical.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>For example, the authorship of</p>
<p>the apocryphal Acts of Paul and ecla (ca. 160) was questioned and </p>
<p>eventually its author, a presbyter in the Church, admitted writing it </p>
<p>not in an attempt to mislead, but in admiration of the apostle Paul. But </p>
<p>this was not sucient argument to the Church leaders who proceeded </p>
<p>to condemn and defrock him for writing in the name of the apostle. </p>
<p>Given that this issue of morality seems to have loomed large when </p>
<p>dealing with apostolic writings, it makes it rather challenging for one </p>
<p>to concede Bauckham’s otherwise well craed argument that the au-</p>
<p>thorship of this letter would have come from the hand of a Petrine </p>
<p>sympathizer.</p>

<p>70. Serapion (ca. 180) is quoted by Eusebius (Eccl. Hist. 6.12.2) declaring about the </p>
<p>Gospel of Peter,” “For our part, brothers, we revere both Peter and other apostles as [we </p>
<p>revere] Christ, but the writings which falsely bear their name we reject” (emphasis added).</p>
<p>71. Bauckham (1983: 162) is aware of these arguments and does not think they dis-</p>
<p>qualify the pseudepigraphy argument. Instead, he thinks that a more apt comparison of </p>
<p>acceptance of 2 Peter as Petrine would be with Origen’s acceptance of Hebrews as written </p>
<p>by Paul because it contains the apostles’ thoughts.</p>
