<p>forward to in the end or even evidence of it in the past? is is the attitude </p>
<p>and belief reected by the “scoers.” </p>
<p>In essence, they expected at least some transformation of things, even </p>
<p>as they waited for the Lord’s return but instead all they see is the same old, </p>
<p>same old—all things continue (diamenei) as they have from beginning of </p>
<p>creation (ktiseōs). at is why, according to Webb, it not merely the failed </p>
<p>return of the Lord that the “scoers” question, but its actual possibility.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e scoers, according to the author, also reference a group called </p>
<p>the fathers who would have been the promulgators of the teaching about </p>
<p>the parousia but who have since died, and it would seem, their teaching </p>
<p>unfullled—For, ever since the fathers (hoi pateres) died (ekoimēthesan—</p>
<p>lit. “fell asleep”). e fathers are either the apostles since they would have </p>
<p>been, like Paul (1 Cor 4:15), the spiritual fathers of the community,</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>the OT prophets through whom the initial parousia (arrival) of Christ was </p>
<p>announced.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>While majority of scholars maintain the former position, the</p>
<p>latter is defended by some. </p>
<p>A third alternative has been oered by Gene Green who prefers to </p>
<p>think that it refers generically to “ancestors” since the issue is the delay of </p>
<p>the promise over a very long stretch of time.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>However, the author’s follow</p>
<p>up with examples of classic events from the Hebrew Bible that showcase </p>
divine intervention during the times of ancient Israel, seems to favor the
<p>preference to OT prophets as the ones behind the author’s thought in this </p>
<p>instance.</p>
<p>God’s Judgment Is Certain to Come (3:5–7)</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>For they wish to ignore the fact that, the heavens long ago existed </p>
<p>and the earth out of water and through water came to existence, </p>
<p>by the word of God; </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>through which also the whole world was </p>
<p>ooded with water and destroyed.</p>
<p> 7</p>
<p>But now, the heavens and the </p>
<p>earth, by the same word, are preserved for re, guarded until the </p>
<p>Day of judgment, and the destruction of the ungodly humans. </p>
<p>e grammar in this section is challenging. Besides the larger contrast of </p>
<p>the world coming to existence through water but now awaiting destruction </p>
