<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>

<p>. Concluding exhortation (15:58)</p>
<p>is parallelism suggests that the most relevant issues include the nature of </p>
<p>the resurrected body, ethical imperatives in light of it, Adam/Christ explica-</p>
<p>tions, the defeat of death, and arguments of disadvantages if denying the </p>
<p>resurrection. </p>
<p>Proclamation of Christ’s Resurrection (15:1–11)</p>
<p>Paul’s words imagine a courtroom setting where he, as advocate for the res-</p>
<p>urrection, unfolds his statement of facts from the past and presents Scrip-</p>
<p>ture and witnesses as evidence of Christ rising from the dead. Such evidence </p>
<p>may be considered inarticial proofs; they are not invented by the orator </p>
<p>and can persuade without rhetorical argumentation (Quintilian, Inst. 5.1; </p>
<p>Aristotle, Rhet. 1.15). Although Paul writes, I make known to you . . . the </p>
<p>gospel which I proclaimed to you, this message is not new to them. ey </p>
<p>already have taken a stand in the gospel, and by it they are presently being </p>
<p>saved. Paul challenges them to remember his early proclamations, and he </p>
<p>implicitly chides them for forgetting them in practice. is gospel relates to </p>
<p>prophetic discourse about the good news of a coming era in which God’s </p>
<p>anointed one, whom Paul interprets as Jesus, would bring deliverance (Isa </p>
<p>61:1–2; cf. 40:9; 52:7).</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>e Corinthians have received this message and are</p>
<p>being saved by it, unless they believed in vain.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> is implicit warning sug-</p>
<p>gests that if they abandon their belief in the gospel, they would jeopardize </p>
<p>their salvation. It evokes pathos by stirring the emotions of his auditors with </p>
<p>hope and fear.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>e stakes could be no higher than the hope of eternal gain</p>
<p>or fear of its loss.</p>
<p>Of primary importance is the gospel Paul received from earlier apostles, </p>
<p>which he passes on to the Corinthians (15:3–5). e creed-like statement </p>
<p>that Christ died . . . was buried . . . rose . . . and appeared to witnesses re-</p>
<p>ects apostolic oral tradition based on very early proclamations.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Although</p>
<p>Paul considers his view to be entirely consistent with these apostles, he </p>
<p>4. See iselton 2000:1184.</p>
<p>5. “In vain” (εἰκῇ: Gal 2:21; 3:4; 4:11) is virtually synonymous with μάταιος (1 Cor </p>
<p>15:17) and κενός (15:10, 14, 58), all of which suggest uselessness or ineectuality (see </p>
<p>Oropeza 2009:148).</p>
<p>6. Eriksson 2001:115–26.</p>
<p>7. e Greek here is not typical of Paul’s, as Jeremias 1966:101–3 demonstrates.</p>
