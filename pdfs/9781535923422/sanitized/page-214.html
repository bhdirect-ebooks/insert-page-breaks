<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>

<p>their speaking has to do with learning and questioning rather than teaching, </p>
<p>proclaiming, and praying. Second, contrary to interpreting λαλέω in 14:34 </p>
<p>as inspired speech, it is clear that elsewhere Paul does not forbid Corinthian </p>
<p>women from such speech, whether prophesying or praying at church (11:5). </p>
<p>ird, Paul’s rhetorical wish that “all” would speak in tongues and prophesy </p>
<p>becomes rather empty if he is precluding all the wives or women (14:5). </p>
<p>Moreover, “each” person in the congregation would seem to include women </p>
<p>who can speak in tongues, interpret, give a revelation, teach, sing, or use an-</p>
<p>other speech gi (14:26). Such inspired speaking involves spiritual gis that </p>
<p>the Spirit distributes to each believer (12:7–11), and nothing suggests that </p>
<p>these gis are given only to men.</p>
<p>260</p>
<p>If Paul agreed with the early Christians</p>
<p>who associate the Spirit’s outpouring with Joel 2:28–32 (cf. 1 Cor 1:2; Acts </p>
<p>2:1–22), this would seem to conrm that prophetic and spiritual speaking </p>
<p>are not just given to “sons” but also “daughters.” e gis of the Spirit do not </p>
<p>discriminate according to gender. Hence, and despite how Paul might use </p>
<p>λαλέω elsewhere, in 14:34 it does not seem to reference inspired speech. </p>
<p>Kenneth Bailey, who has extensive experience working with women in </p>
<p>Mediterranean villages, says that chatting is still a problem in these church </p>
<p>gatherings.</p>
<p>261</p>
<p>He attributes this to factors such as lack of education and</p>
<p>social contacts, along with short attention spans that such things might </p>
<p>induce. e problem in 14:34–35 may involve similar factors in which chat-</p>
<p>ting becomes a way of learning. Hence, the chatting of these women, along </p>
<p>with both genders inappropriately using tongues and prophecy, hinder or-</p>
<p>derly worship. Paul requests the culprits of all three to be silent in church </p>
<p>(14:28, 30, 34). For the latter he essentially says, “Women, please stop chat-</p>
<p>ting so you can listen to the women (and men) who are trying to bring you a </p>
<p>prophetic word but cannot do so when no one can hear them.”</p>
<p>262</p>
<p>e wives</p>
must therefore be silent and submit themselves to the speaker under divine
<p>guidance in reverence to God, whoever he or she might be (cf. 16:16, 18; </p>
<p>Eph 5:18–21). </p>
<p>is silence and submission is in accordance with the Law, that is, </p>
<p>Scripture (see 14:21). Genesis 1–3, or more particularly 3:16, does not ap-</p>
<p>pear to be what is referenced since silence and submission are foremost </p>
<p>to the speaker rather than husband, and in any case, nothing is said about </p>
<p>silence in Gen 1–3.</p>
