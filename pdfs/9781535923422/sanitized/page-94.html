<p>The Limits of Mingling with Vice-Doers (5:9–13)</p>
<p>If the congregation is to expel the incestuous man, how are the members </p>
<p>to relate to others who commit similar vices? Paul seems to anticipate an </p>
<p>inquiry of this sort as he uses reductio ad absurdum and employs vice lists, </p>
<p>rhetorical questions, and scripture quotation in 5:9–13. </p>
<p>With the words, I wrote to you in my letter, Paul wants the Corinthi-</p>
<p>ans to recall an earlier epistle he wrote to them that we no longer have.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>it he urged them not to mingle with fornicators. e lists of vice-doers to </p>
<p>be shunned in 5:10–11, showcasing fornicators, greedy persons, idolaters, </p>
<p>drunkards, swindlers, and revilers, are merely representative of innumer-</p>
<p>able others (see 6:9–10). e rst four vices clearly reect the congrega-</p>
<p>tion’s current practices, and the last two probably do also if we consider </p>
<p>how members are nancially defrauded and speak against one another’s </p>
<p>allegiances (6:8; 1:10—4:21). Paul selects these vices as a way of prompting </p>
<p>Corinthian recollection of their present and past behaviors.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>At any rate,</p>
<p>he did not mean in his previous letter that the Corinthians should have no </p>
<p>interactions with any vice-doers. Such prohibition would involve a reductio </p>
<p>ad absurdum, as Paul explains—otherwise, you would have to escape the </p>
<p>world itself when trying to avoid vice-doers! He meant that believers should </p>
<p>not mingle with anyone who calls himself a brother (a fellow believer in </p>
<p>Christ) and yet is in the habit of committing the above-mentioned vices.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ey are not to associate in a close way or mix indiscriminately with such </p>
<p>persons.</p>

<p>iselton rightly favors that Paul discourages a qualied mixing</p>
<p>28. Mitchell 1991:329.</p>
<p>29. “I wrote” (ἔγραψα) is likely not epistolary in 5:9 and 11: cf. Conzelmann </p>
<p>1975:102, who adds that “now” (νῦν) in 5:11 “is logical. . . . Paul is explaining what he </p>
<p>really wrote, i.e., meant.” BDAG 681, translates νῦν δέ as “but, as a matter of fact . . .” </p>
<p>NASB has this sense, contra NRSV.</p>
<p>30. Both Rosner 1994: 68–70 and Hays 1997:87–88, suggest Paul is guided by the </p>
<p>vices in Deuteronomy (13:1–5; 17:2–7; 19:16–19; 22:18–22, 30; 24:7). But if so, Deu-</p>
<p>teronomy does not mention the greedy person (πλεονέκτης), and Paul seems more </p>
<p>concerned about relevant vices for his auditors than including a stock list.</p>
<p>31. See May 2004:74–75. Gundry Volf 1990:124–25, interprets ὀνομαζόμενος as </p>
<p>a “so-called” brother to argue that this oender is a false believer. e current spiri-</p>
<p>tual state of this hypothetical person may be questionable, but this says nothing about </p>
<p>whether his earlier state and conversion were inauthentic.</p>
