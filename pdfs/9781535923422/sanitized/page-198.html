<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>174</p>
<p>it refer to Christian maturity in love (Paul had such maturity yet still speaks </p>
<p>in tongues: 2:6; 14:18).</p>
<p>174</p>
<p>It refers to the completion of the ages at the second</p>
<p>coming of Christ. Spiritual gis, then, inclusive of tongues, are expected to </p>
<p>operate until Christ returns (1:7).</p>
<p>175</p>
<p> In 13:9, “For” introduces the expla-</p>
<p>nation of when and why these gis will end.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p>In the verses that follow,</p>
<p>the repetitive use of now at the present time and then at that future time </p>
<p>supports that the present age has these spiritual gis as a partial revelation, </p>
<p>and the coming age does away with these gis since at Christ’s return the </p>
<p>full revelation will be present with believers. Paul uses two illustrations to </p>
<p>support the idea of eschatological completion. First, the words, when I was </p>
<p>a child invites auditors to recall earlier years when they spoke, thought, and </p>
<p>reasoned like a child, but this was all prior to their coming of age when they </p>
<p>set aside childish things. is is likened to spiritual gis in the present age </p>
<p>in relation to the future age of completion when believers will set aside their </p>
<p>gis as though toys.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>Presently they can only communicate knowledge and</p>
<p>prophecy in part, which suggests that such communication is incomplete </p>
<p>and fragmentary, providing only glimpses of what is up ahead. </p>
<p>Second, the believers’ perception of spiritual things and God in Christ </p>
<p>are compared with looking by means of a mirror indirectly or in a riddle.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Such imagery would be entirely relevant for recipients familiar with bronze </p>
<p>mirrors produced in Corinth.</p>
<p>179</p>
<p>Mirrors made of this material needed to be</p>
<p>polished regularly to see one’s image clearer. Paul may be assuming a well-</p>
known Jewish and Hellenistic sentiment that what is divine can only be seen or known indirectly, as it were, through things that “represent the divine and
<p>which are to be regarded as ‘signs’ or ‘images’ of God.”</p>
<p>180</p>
<p> If so, then know-</p>
<p>ing face to face means the mirror will be set aside and believers will see </p>
<p>this interpretation overlooks how verb use forms a chiastic pattern of prophecy (A), </p>
<p>tongues (B), and knowledge (A1) in 13:8 that stylistically helps avoid “tedious repeti-</p>
<p>tion” (Fisk 2000:89) instead of imply an earlier cessation of tongues than the other two </p>
<p>gis. ere is no evidence in the NT to support that Paul or any apostle knew or taught </p>
<p>that tongues would cease before other gis.</p>
<p>174. And if referring to this maturity for the church worldwide, when could that </p>
<p>ever take place except at the second coming?</p>

<p>177. Καταργέω (“set aside,” “abolish”) describes both the ending of gis (13:8, 10) </p>
<p>and childish ways (13:11). </p>
<p>178. Αἴνιγμα (“riddle,” “indirectly”) may be another example of Paul’s use of double </p>
<p>entendre (see 4:6 Excursus).</p>
