<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>. Male and female distinction related to nature and reecting </p>
<p>honor/shame (11:13–15)</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>. Custom based on tradition in all churches (11:16)</p>
<p>Strategically the beginning and end of this discourse provide the Corin-</p>
<p>thians with an example of personal instruction compatible with other </p>
<p>churches in Christ. In the chiasm’s center, Paul draws a conclusion about </p>
<p>what should be done at the intersection of public and private spaces. Based </p>
<p>on the multiple times women/wives and men/husbands appear in this text </p>
<p>(sixteen and fourteen, respectively), it is evident that an issue regarding </p>
<p>gender distinction is at stake. But without knowing the details, we are le </p>
<p>with the frustrating task of working on a puzzle without all its pieces.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>We</p>
<p>might also be tempted to read the text anachronistically, since its message </p>
<p>does not t well with our own cultural norms.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Our apostle works within a</p>
<p>classication system entrenched in a patriarchal world that knows nothing </p>
<p>about today’s ideologies. Such problems compel us to approach this text </p>
<p>with great humility.</p>
<p>Paul begins praising his auditors because they remember him in ev-</p>
<p>erything and hold rmly the traditions just as I delivered them to you. </p>
<p>ey maintain his instructions from his earlier visit, though his words </p>
<p>are hyperbolic in an eort to build rapport. As the texts unfold, there are </p>
<p>problems with the way they carry out certain apostolic traditions. Relevant </p>
<p>to 11:2–16 may be a tradition that the apostles encouraged prophetic en-</p>
<p>ablement for both genders (Acts 2:17–21).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>When in Corinth, Paul and his</p>
<p>colleagues probably exemplied according to gender what it was to pray </p>
<p>and prophesy with head coverings (e.g., Priscilla) and without them (Paul, </p>
<p>Aquila). Perhaps certain members noticed how other members did not </p>
<p>maintain this custom aer Paul le Corinth, and in their letter to Paul they </p>
<p>raised questions about it to which he now responds.</p>
<p>ree heads are mentioned in 11:3—the head of every man is </p>
<p>Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ </p>
<p>is God. Paul uses head (κεφαλή) metaphorically in this verse, but in what </p>
<p>sense? ree common interpretations are that it refers to “authority over,” </p>
<p>“source/origin,” or “that which is most prominent, foremost, upper-most, </p>
<p>pre-eminent.”</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>e rst option may work well with the idea of submission,</p>
<p>1. Some suggest a non-Pauline interpolation here (e.g., Mount 2005:313–40; Crock-</p>
<p>er 2004:158–59), but this view lacks ancient manuscript support.</p>
