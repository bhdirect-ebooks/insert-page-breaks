<p>we know that we all have knowledge (8:1b), and, we know that an idol is </p>
<p>nothing in the world and that there is no God but one (8:4), are perhaps </p>
<p>his paraphrased versions of the strong members’ sayings.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Paul will correct</p>
<p>their views.</p>
<p>To their rst saying he responds that such knowledge pus up; it </p>
<p>could inate members to think too highly of themselves and better than </p>
others, which would only engender more congregational divisions. Paul
<p>advances instead the idea that love builds up; it edies rather than alienates </p>
<p>members. is antithesis between knowledge and love is explicated further </p>
<p>in 8:2–3. In a passive-active word play, he deates conceited members by </p>
<p>asserting that they do not know as they ought to know. What they ought </p>
<p>to know is that they are to love God and desire to be known by Him. e </p>
<p>assumption is that God knows and has fellowship with those who obey God </p>
<p>and Christ’s teachings. To be known by God is to belong to God.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Paul’s</p>
<p>stress on love echoes the Jewish Shema: “Hear O Israel, the Lord our God </p>
<p>is one Lord. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and </p>
<p>with all your soul, and with all your strength” (Deut 6:4–5). Perhaps Jesus’s </p>
<p>words are also remembered here since he taught his followers to love God </p>
<p>and their neighbors as themselves (Mark 12:28–34; Lev 19:18). Paul’s audi-</p>
<p>tors are to ponder on the idea that those who know the one true God are </p>
<p>characterized by their love, and they should recognize that weaker members </p>
<p>in Christ are their neighbors.</p>
<p>In response to their second saying, Paul again alludes to the Shema. </p>
<p>Both he and the strong members believe that there is only one God to the </p>
<p>exclusion of all other deities (Isa 41:4; 43:10). at there are many so-called </p>
<p>gods among the nations suggests these deities are not real to Paul. e </p>
<p>idols that represent them are dumb and lifeless (12:2; cf. Isa 40:18–21; Jer </p>
<p>10:3–11; Deut 32:21). If there is one God, there are no other gods (Deut </p>
<p>6:4–5; cf. 32:12, 31, 39; Isa 41:4; 43:10). e congregation’s city included </p>
<p>numerous temples and statues of deities, including Poseidon, Athena, and </p>
<p>Aphrodite (Pausanius, Descr. 2.1–5), and its inhabitants devoted themselves </p>
<p>to gods such as Asclepius, Isis, Demeter, Kore, and Dionysus.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Corinth’s</p>
<p>inhabitants, along with the weaker congregation members, believe that </p>
<p>many gods and many lords do exist, though this does not reect Paul’s </p>
<p>Christians (Gardner 1994:15–16; Newton 1998:179–83). On the denition, see Still </p>
<p>2002:231.</p>
<p>4. Another Corinthian saying is possible in 8:8 (see Murphy-O’Connor </p>
<p>2009:76–86).</p>
5. is idea reects divine election as Schnabel 2006:442–43, arms.
<p>6. See e.g., Fotopoulos 2003:49–157; Coutsoumpos 2008:171–77; Bookidis </p>
<p>2005:41–64.</p>
