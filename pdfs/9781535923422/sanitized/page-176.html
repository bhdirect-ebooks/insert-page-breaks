<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>serves to explain the reason for his displeasure described in 11:17–18</p>
<p>.57</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Verse 19, then, conveys something negative about those who are approved, </p>
and as such it could hardly be referring to divine election or to the divine necessity of divisions in light of prophecy (e.g., Matt 10:35–36).
<p>58</p>
<p>Paul is</p>
<p>being sarcastic by presenting the approved ones (δόκιμοι) as elitists or dig-</p>
<p>nitaries (see Philo Jos. 34[210]).</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>Similar uses of approval are found in</p>
<p>voluntary associations and comparable with members gaining honor and </p>
<p>positions in these associations.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>In this manner Paul once again attempts</p>
to shame their overestimation of themselves that is instigating divisions,
<p>similar to his inated description of them as kings in 4:8. His irony makes </p>
<p>the rebuke that follows all the more pointed—us, when you come to-</p>
<p>gether in the same place, it is not to eat the Lord’s Supper!</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>ey have</p>
<p>turned the sacred meal into something selsh and status seeking. Paul’s </p>
<p>rebuke along with his lack of praise elicit the auditors’ pathos by amplifying </p>
<p>their practice as disgraceful.</p>
<p>eir commemoration of Jesus’s Last Supper appears to be celebrated </p>
<p>as a full dinner, apparently in the manner of an eranos, a picnic-like or con-</p>
<p>tributed meal in which each person eats what he or she brings.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> anks-</p>
<p>giving and breaking of shared bread perhaps commenced the dinner in a </p>
<p>manner recalling Jesus’s nal dinner, and special signicance was attributed </p>
<p>to drinking from one cup of wine, which may have taken place at the meal’s </p>
<p>end (10:16; 11:25).</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>Aer the dinner, too, proclamations, teachings from</p>
<p>scripture, and oral traditions related to Jesus may have continued (see Acts </p>
<p>20:7–8). is meal might be similar to the structure of a symposium in </p>
<p>Greco-Roman parlance, though in the latter case rhetorical speeches, philo-</p>
<p>sophical discussions, music, and entertainment, along with more drinking </p>
<p>that oen devolved into debauchery and sexual improprieties, took place.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>57. Or the reason why he cannot praise them (Garland 2003:538).</p>
<p>58. Barrett 1968:262 rightly contests the former but accepts the latter.</p>
<p>59. Campbell 1991:65–70. </p>
<p>60. See McRae 2011:179.</p>
<p>61. e “Lord’s Supper” (κυριακός δεῖπνον) at this time may not have been known </p>
<p>as a technical term, if McGowan 2015:503–21 is correct. But even if so, commemora-</p>
<p>tion of Jesus’s last supper still seems to be celebrated in the language of a fellowship </p>
<p>meal (10:16), the “Lord’s table” (10:21), and perhaps included in meals related to the </p>
<p>breaking of bread (Acts 2:42–46; 20:7–11; Keener 2012:1.1003–4).</p>
<p>62. is is not quite the same as a “potluck” in which each one contributes to the </p>
<p>one meal that everyone eats. See Homer Od. 1.226–27; Athenaeus Deipn. 8.365AB; </p>
<p>Coutsoumpos 2005:46–51; Lampe 1994:38–39.</p>
