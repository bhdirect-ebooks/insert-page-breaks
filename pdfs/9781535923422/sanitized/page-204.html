<p>understanding) may be inactive but not absent. Clear thoughts are needed </p>
<p>to produce intelligible words, but tongues are not intelligible.</p>
<p>207</p>
<p>us,</p>
<p>when he prays in tongues, it does not benet his own mind nor the minds </p>
<p>of others.</p>
<p>208</p>
<p>His follow-up question asks for a conclusion to the matter</p>
<p>(14:15a),</p>
<p>209</p>
<p>which is, I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the</p>
<p>mind also. Both unintelligible and intelligible prayer edies Paul’s spirit, </p>
<p>but the latter can also edifying others. He adds charismatic singing to this: </p>
<p>I will sing with my spirit, which is apparently done non-cognitively and in </p>
<p>tongues, perhaps similar to the hymnic style of angelic worship performed </p>
<p>by Hemera, Job’s daughter (T.Job 48.3).</p>
<p>210</p>
<p>is contrasts, I will sing with my</p>
<p>mind also, which doubtless means to sing cognitively with understandable </p>
<p>lyrics, which was part of ancient worship (14:26; Eph 5:19; Col 3:16). Paul </p>
<p>encourages both types of prayer and singing, but when congregants wor-</p>
<p>ship together, comprehensible worship is reinforced by another hypotheti-</p>
<p>cal situation in which an outsider visits the congregation. is is someone </p>
<p>who takes up the place of the uninformed and does not know or has not </p>
<p>experienced tongues and spiritual gis (14:16).</p>
<p>211</p>
<p>Who is this visitor? He</p>
<p>or she can potentially say, Amen, and thus seems familiar with emergent </p>
<p>Christian jargon (see 16:24). Maybe this person is an unbaptized attender </p>
<p>open to the gospel. In any case, Paul expects the answer that, due to incom-</p>
<p>prehension, this visitor will not be able to respond in conrmation of the </p>
<p>tongue-speaker’s blessing and thanksgiving. e visitor remains unedied.</p>
<p>Our apostle gives thanks, saying that I speak in tongues more than all </p>
<p>of you. He gives credit not to himself but to God for this enablement. Per-</p>
<p>haps he assumes quantitatively that in private he prays in tongues more than </p>
<p>they do, or maybe his speaking is qualitatively better because he “under-</p>
<p>stands, appreciates, and experiences this gi more intensely.”</p>
<p>212</p>
<p>en again,</p>
<p>it is not clear how he would know of this either way. e claim is therefore </p>
<p>hyperbole with the rhetorical aim of eliciting ethos, an appeal to his spiritual </p>
<p>character. It also helps amplify his next point, which is also hyperbole. Even </p>
<p>though he exercises this gi more than they do, when in church, I wish to </p>
<p>speak ve words with my mind, so that I may instruct others also, than </p>
<p>ten thousand words in a tongue. Paul’s ability to communicate anything </p>
