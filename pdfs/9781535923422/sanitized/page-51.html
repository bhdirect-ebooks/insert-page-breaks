<p>that renders faith unnecessary.”</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>e sign given them is an unexpected</p>
<p>king—Jesus became a cursed criminal who hung on a tree (Deut 21:22 </p>
<p>–23), which is how Jewish interpreters understood crucixion.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>As such,</p>
<p>the prophetic cornerstone of Zion from Isa 28:16, which Paul interprets as </p>
<p>Jesus, became their stumbling block obstructing their way to faith and de-</p>
<p>liverance (Rom 9:33; cf. 1 Cor 3:10–11).</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unbelieving Greeks seek wisdom.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> e wisdom in this phrase ap-</p>
<p>pears to be very broad; it most likely includes philosophy and not merely </p>
<p>rhetoric. ose who pride themselves in this pursuit might be expected to </p>
<p>respond to the cross with mockery, akin with how the Epicurean and Stoic </p>
<p>philosophers respond to the message of resurrection in Acts 17:31–32. e </p>
<p>many allusions to thoughts similar to Stoicism in this letter may suggest </p>
<p>that some Corinthians were inuenced by this philosophy.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Together with</p>
<p>other Gentiles they interpret a crucied Jew who claims to be savior as fool-</p>
<p>ishness. Crucixion is for criminals and communicates weakness, defeat, </p>
<p>humility, shame, and low status.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Seneca, for example, mentions crucixion</p>
<p>as a way to depict humiliation related to his own situation (Vit. Beat. 19.3), </p>
<p>and Cicero considers crucixion to be a shameful thing that should not be </p>
<p>seen or heard (Rab. Perd. 5.16).</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>is was a punishment for slaves (Verr.</p>
<p>5.169–70).</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Foolishness of this sort does not convey merely intellectual</p>
<p>nonsense but social worthlessness. e fool is typically imagined as an ugly, </p>
<p>despised, subhuman of low status; the butt of jokes and object of ridicule.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And this particular crucied man made claims of sovereignty as Messiah. </p>
<p>Hence, to follow and confess him as Lord risks an aront to Caesar that </p>
<p>invites persecution.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>A third group, however, views crucixion in a dierent light (1:24–25). </p>
<p>ese are Jews and Gentiles who are called by God to be a holy people in </p>
<p>fellowship with Christ (1:2, 9); they are the ones who believe they are saved </p>
