<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>176</p>
<p>the future hope having nally arrived, there is no need to hope anymore </p>
<p>(Rom 8:23–25). What remains perpetually is love, which is to characterize </p>
<p>the intimate relationship believers have with God and each other both now </p>
<p>and forever.</p>
<p>Prophecy as Greater than Tongues (14:1–19)</p>
<p>Now that Paul has expounded on spiritual gis as benecial for the soli-</p>
<p>darity of members (1 Cor 12), and their value as worthless without love </p>
<p>(13), he proceeds to address their ability to build up members when they </p>
<p>assemble together (14:3–5, 12, 17, 26).</p>
<p>186</p>
<p> eir coming together is remi-</p>
<p>niscent of language used when participating in the Lord’s Supper (14:26; cf. </p>
<p>11:17–18, 33) and perhaps is suggestive of speech-acts that take place aer </p>
<p>dinner, as though at a Christian symposium. is chapter compares tongues </p>
<p>and prophecy (esp. 14:1–5), which suggests a use of synkrisis in which two </p>
<p>gis rather than persons are being compared, and prophecy turns out to be </p>
<p>the greater gi.</p>
<p>187</p>
<p>Paul also employs rhetorical questions (4:6–8, 9, 16, 23,</p>
<p>36), illustration (14:7–8), paranomasia (word plays: 14:10, 38), hyperbole </p>
<p>(14:18–19), and Scripture citation (14:21). His designation “brothers and </p>
<p>sisters” breaks the discourse into four parts (14:6, 20, 26, 39), and evokes im-</p>
<p>ages of a family being taught wisdom in relation to building up one another </p>
<p>(as well as outsiders), which is done through the harmonious and orderly </p>
<p>use of speech gis. e importance of speaking the same thing (1:10) rather </p>
<p>than speaking in a disharmonious and unintelligible manner, fosters unity </p>
<p>and edication. Dio Chrysostom promotes a similar rhetorical tact by ad-</p>
<p>vancing the signicance of an assembly having a common language for the </p>
<p>sake of concord (Or. 32.29; 39.3).</p>
<p>188</p>
<p>In keeping with deliberative rhetoric,</p>
<p>Paul presents himself as someone to imitate, hypothetically speaking (14:6, </p>
<p>11, 14–15, 19). A string of imperatives related to proper conduct when as-</p>
<p>sembling together reinforces that what Paul says here is the “command of </p>
<p>the Lord” (14:37; cf. 1, 12–13, 20, 26–30, 34–35, 37, 39–40).</p>
<p>e Corinthians foremost are to pursue love and earnestly desire </p>
<p>spiritual things, and in particular (earnestly desire) that you may proph-</p>
<p>esy.</p>
