<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>

<p>wisdom, power, and persona.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>ere is no room for boasting in human</p>
<p>achievements when in the presence of God.</p>
From the divine presence ows salvic benets through their union
<p>in Christ, which includes spiritual wisdom (2:6–16), a right standing </p>
<p>before God (2 Cor 5:21), sanctication (1 Cor 1:2; 3:16–17), and re-</p>
<p>demption from sin and death (Rom 3:24). ese benets, which are both </p>
<p>present and futuristic, are imparted to them from God through Christ. </p>
<p>e believers become righteous at conversion (1 Cor 6:11) and yet receive </p>
<p>nal justication on judgment day (4:4). ey become holy saints at con-</p>
<p>version (1:2) and yet complete sanctication is experienced at the second </p>
<p>coming (1 ess 5:23). ey are presently redeemed from sin (1 Cor 6:20; </p>
<p>7:23; Rom 3:24) and yet look forward to the redemption of their mortal </p>
<p>bodies via resurrection (Rom 8:23). e now and not yet component of </p>
<p>these benets are complementary to what it means to be currently in the </p>
<p>process of being saved (1 Cor 1:18).</p>
<p>God’s Power Rather Than Rhetorical Wisdom (2:1–5)</p>
<p>Paul continues in wisdom discourse to present himself as a role model of </p>
<p>weakness and humility related to the cruciform life in the passage. rough </p>
<p>use of antithetical statements and anaphora (“and I in . . . and in . . . and </p>
<p>in . . . ” 2:3) he contrasts worldly wisdom with the message of the cross </p>
<p>and power of God’s Spirit. e Corinthians are reminded about the rst </p>
<p>time Paul visited them (cf. Acts 18:1–18): he did not come to them with </p>
<p>superiority of eloquence or of wisdom. A comparison of 2:1, 4, and 1:17 </p>
<p>makes clear that Paul is referring to an excess of rhetorical eloquence when </p>
<p>speaking. In these verses “speech” (λόγος) and “wisdom” (σοφία) are com-</p>
<p>bined, proclamation is the subject, and Paul disavows the form of speaking </p>
<p>described.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>His thought in 2:1 comes close to Eunapius’s description of</p>
<p>Maximus the Neoplatonist—this sophist being pued up with pride and </p>
<p>“superabundant eloquence” despised logical proof (Vit. 475 cf. 470).</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>e persuasive words of wisdom in 2:4 adds the thought of persua-</p>
<p>sion that captures the central aim of rhetorical discourses (Aristotle Rhet. </p>
<p>1.1.14; Longinus, Subl. 44.1; Philostratus Vit. soph. 1.498).</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>Paul’s message</p>
<p>38. Christ is normally Lord, but in 1:31 God may be meant or God as revealed </p>
<p>through Christ (cf. 2 Cor 5:19).</p>
<p>39. Cf. Litn 1994:205. See also 2:13 though here teaching is the subject.</p>
<p>40. i.e., “λόγων ὑπεροχήν.” On ὑπεροχή as social prestige related to wisdom and </p>
<p>eloquence, see Diodorus Siculus 34/35.5.5; Eunapius Vit. 466; Pogolo 1992:132–33.</p>
<p>41. NA27 has “πειθοῖ[ς] σοφίας [λόγοις]” (2:4). On Greek manuscript variations, </p>
<p>see Ebojo 2009:10 –21; Meztger/United Bible Societies 1994:481; BDAG 791.</p>
