<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>referring to 3:19–21 despite Paul’s convoluted grammar, and would his </p>
<p>Gentile audience be informed enough to connect the dots between being </p>
<p>puffed up and boasting with Paul’s citation? Perhaps a minority would.</p>
<p>Since both options 4 and 5 seem to target at least a minority of the </p>
<p>congregants, another relevant question to ask is this: would Paul make these </p>
<p>connections, whether by maxim or citation, regardless of whether most of </p>
<p>his auditors would have understood them? I think the answer would be yes. </p>
<p>As any learned communicator knows, past or present, certain quotes and </p>
<p>words of theirs will not be understood by everyone. Sometimes the words are </p>
<p>understood only by few, and yet that does not prevent communicators from </p>
<p>saying them anyway. Film makers are experts at this—for example, in a chil-</p>
<p>dren’s ﬁlm, the majority of their youthful audiences do not understand every </p>
<p>part of the ﬁlm, especially humorous double entendres that are targeted at </p>
<p>their parents! Double entendre (ἀμφιβολία), in fact, was an admirable qual-</p>
<p>ity for communicators in the ancient world; use of this device characterized </p>
<p>the speeches of Hermocrates of Phocaea (Philostratus Vit. soph. 2.609).</p>
<p>179</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Might Paul being doing something similar here? Perhaps he deliberatively </p>
<p>framed his words in a way that would enable some of his auditors to think </p>
<p>back on the Scripture he just cited, while others would recognize a popular </p>
<p>saying recalling children learning how to write. </p>
<p>ree rhetorical questions now challenge the Corinthians in 4:7:</p>
<p>180</p>
<p>Who</p>
<p>regards you to be superior (to others)? expects the answer “no one” (cf. </p>
<p>Acts 15:9). And what do you have which you did not receive? expects the </p>
<p>answer “nothing.” And, why do you boast as though not the receiver? </p>
<p>anticipates the response, “I should not be boasting; all that I am and ev-</p>
<p>erything I receive is a gi from God.” Seneca admonishes his elite readers </p>
<p>that wealth and possessions are meant to share and give away, but instead </p>
<p>of being mere stewards of these things, their wealth has caused them to </p>
<p>swell with pride and exalt themselves over others (Ben. 6.3.1–4; cf. 2.18.1; </p>
<p>4.6.3). Paul’s words similarly aim to admonish the Corinthians who instead </p>
<p>of wealth receive knowledge, salvic benets, spiritual gis, and leaders like </p>
<p>Paul and Apollos. What they receive should not inate them with arrogance </p>
<p>against others but prompt them with the realization that nothing is theirs as </p>
<p>179. See further examples in LSJ 90; Wright 1998:567.</p>
<p>180. Paul’s switch to second person singulars in 4:7 is motivated by “one against the </p>
<p>other” in 4:6c. He is not singling out one congregation member (cf. Schnabel 2006:244).</p>
