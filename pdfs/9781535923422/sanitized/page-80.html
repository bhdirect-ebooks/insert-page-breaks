<p>Excursus: Interpreting “What is Written” in 4:6</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>instruction “beyond what is written” in these Scriptures (e.g., 15:33), and </p>
<p>in any case, the entire corpus of these scriptures does not center on the </p>
<p>prevention of being puffed up (4:6c).</p>
<p>168</p>
<p>With option 4 there is no consensus regarding the content of this </p>
<p>saying. Some arguments are that it refers to written cultic by-laws in the </p>
<p>Corinthian congregation, political formulae promoting reconciliation, or the </p>
<p>politics of building construction in which building contractors direct work-</p>
<p>ers not to violate contract stipulations.</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>If option 4 is correct, I tend to</p>
<p>agree with John Fitzgerald and others that the saying is pedagogical.</p>
<p>170</p>
<p>This</p>
<p>passage is ﬁlled with pedagogical words including the necessity to learn </p>
<p>(4:6), tutors (4:15), parental guidance (4:15), imitation (4:16), remem-</p>
<p>brance (4:17), and teaching (4:17). We already know that the Corinthians </p>
<p>are immature and still have to be taught the basic A, B, C’s of faith because </p>
<p>they do not understand spiritual wisdom (2:6–3:4). Hence, Paul instructs </p>
<p>them about the cross (1:18–31) and teaches them ﬁgurative roles so that </p>
<p>they might learn not to pit their leaders against each other (3:5—4:6). They </p>
<p>must now learn the saying at hand. This setting evokes a depiction of Paul </p>
<p>as teacher of the Corinthian students. Paul’s term for learning (μανθάνω), </p>
<p>inter alia was used for those learning how to write.</p>
<p>171</p>
<p>Reading and writing</p>
<p>were among essential disciplines to be learned from the age of seven, and </p>
<p>beginners learned to identify, pronounce, and write the Greek alphabet, </p>
<p>often following models from their teacher.</p>
<p>172</p>
<p>Teachers trained children how</p>
<p>to write the alphabet and basic words by having them trace the letters over </p>
<p>the teacher’s own lines (cf. Plato, Protag. 326D; Seneca Lucil. 94.51). </p>
<p>Quintilian explains the procedure: “As soon as the child has begun to know </p>
<p>the shapes of the various letters, it will be no bad thing to have them cut as </p>
<p>accurately as possible upon a board, so that the pen may be guided along </p>
<p>the grooves. Thus, mistakes such as occur with wax tablets will be rendered </p>
<p>impossible; for the pen will be conﬁned between the edges of the letters and </p>
<p>will be prevented from going astray” (Inst. 1.1.27).</p>
<p>173</p>
<p>In this light, Paul is</p>
<p>quoting to the Corinthians a saying for children learning how to follow their </p>
<p>168. e word φυσιόω is not even found in the LXX.</p>
