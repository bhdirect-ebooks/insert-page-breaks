<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>95</p>
<p>leaving open the question of whether a member’s unbelieving spouse will </p>
<p>ultimately believe. For how do you know . . . whether you will save your </p>
<p>unbelieving spouse? e question is posed to both husbands and wives and </p>
<p>could be interpreted optimistically or pessimistically. If optimistically, the </p>
<p>unbeliever might come to faith, and so it is a good idea to stay with that per-</p>
<p>son (cf. 1 Pet 3:1). If pessimistically, the implication is that the abandoned </p>
<p>spouse does not need to attempt reconciliation—there is no way of knowing </p>
<p>whether the unbeliever will come to faith and be saved. e negative sense is </p>
<p>more contextually present, but “how do you know?” (τί οἶδας) is oen posed </p>
<p>in a positive sense.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p> Perhaps Paul le the question deliberately ambiguous.</p>

<p>In what sense is an unbelieving spouse made holy by the believing spouse? </p>
<p>The typical unbeliever in Corinth is not a secularist in the modern sense of </p>
<p>the word. He or she believes in other deities rather than the one God of Jews </p>
<p>and Christians. This person likely found it annoying or even sacrilegious that </p>
<p>the Christian spouse no longer venerated other gods and household spirits.</p>
<p>143</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul assumes a conﬂict over religious beliefs and practices at stake in such </p>
<p>homes. Their children, who are perhaps assumed to be young, unbaptized, </p>
<p>dependents,</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>were expected to follow the customs of their parents, but</p>
<p>in this case which parent? With regular religious conﬂicts of this sort at </p>
<p>home, we could surmise that some believing fathers may have asked Paul </p>
<p>if they could end their marriages. On the other hand, believing mothers </p>
<p>may not have wished the dissolution of their marriages if J. D. Gordon is </p>
<p>correct in suggesting that in patriarchal societies, children legally belonged </p>
<p>to the father.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>That would mean the unbelieving father would be able to</p>
<p>take the children if the marriage ended, and believing mothers might fear </p>
<p>their “clean” children would become “unclean” at their unbelieving father’s </p>
<p>home. In addition, believers of both sexes probably asked whether they and </p>
<p>their children might become polluted via the unbelieving spouse’s idolatry </p>
<p>if they all continue to live under one roof. If children were to respect their </p>

<p>143. Hodge 2010:1–25, does a good job of showing how in ancient mixed mar-</p>
<p>riages, the Christian’s view of deity comes into conict with the unbeliever’s view.</p>
