<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>
<p>212</p>
<p>Lest they misinterpret his irony as encouraging the very thing he con-</p>
<p>demns, Paul directs some pointed imperatives their way evoking pathos; </p>
<p>they should feel ashamed of their behavior. First, he charges them, do </p>
<p>not be deceived! As Winter points out, they should not think that “their </p>
<p>future was not spiritually aected by their present actions.”</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>e maxim,</p>
<p>bad companions corrupt good habits, best known to us from Menander </p>
<p>(ais frag. 187[218]; cf. Plutarch Lib. ed. 12D; Philo, Det. 38), contextu-</p>
<p>ally denounces prostitution, which happens to be a problem relevant for the </p>
<p>Corinthians.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>Corrupt inuences may come from the outside, such as from</p>
<p>their sexual liaisons (6:9–20), and also from insiders who live immorally but </p>
<p>claim to be believers (5:9–11). It behooves congregation members, then, to </p>
<p>be alert to bad inuences and take the appropriate steps necessary to ensure </p>
<p>sucient fellowship with those who really know God, while at the same </p>
<p>time remaining a positive inuence to outsiders.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>Second, he charges them</p>
<p>that, instead of getting drunk and indulging in destructive vices reminiscent </p>
<p>of their pre-converted status, they must get sober and stop sinning! eir </p>
<p>present unethical conduct demonstrates that some have no knowledge of </p>
<p>God, an ironic twist that especially deates the strong members who boast </p>
<p>of just the opposite (8:1–3). In the present context, not knowing God may </p>
<p>be associated with lack of recognition that God knows everything including </p>
<p>their sinful behavior to which they will be held accountable on judgment </p>
<p>day (4:5). It also reects their lack of dependency on God’s sovereignty and </p>
<p>power to create new things, such as raising the dead (cf. Rom 4:17b).</p>

<p>The Nature of Bodily Resurrection (15:35–49)</p>
<p>Having advanced his exhortations Paul now explains the nature of the res-</p>
<p>urrection starting with two questions: But one will say, “How are the dead </p>
<p>raised and with what kind of body do they come?” e rst question may </p>
<p>either reect an actual Corinthian question or Paul’s own rhetorical ques-</p>
<p>tion to direct the discussion in a didactic way. e second question may </p>
<p>simply explicate the rst. ere seems to be implied skepticism, as though </p>
<p>Paul were challenged by an interlocutor in a diatribe.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>Our apostle responds</p>
<p>in the vocative: You foolish fellow!</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>He answers these questions employing</p>
