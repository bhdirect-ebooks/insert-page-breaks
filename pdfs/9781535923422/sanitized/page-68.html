<p>disciples of the sophists and the Christian disciples was identical. ere were </p>
<p>the same assertions of loyalty to one’s teachers, the same pride (‘pued up’) </p>
<p>with the same strife resulting as they denigrated other teachers while at the </p>
<p>same time singing the praises of their own.”</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>Envy and discord manifested</p>
<p>among congregants as they claimed loyalty to their mentors.</p>
<p>On Planting and Building the Corinthian </p>
<p>Congregation (3:5–17)</p>
<p>is passage depicts Paul and Apollos in the metaphors of eld workers and </p>
<p>builders with the Corinthians as the eld of God they cultivate (3:5–9b) and </p>
<p>temple of God they erect (3:9c–17). rough the rst image Paul teaches </p>
<p>against discord several ways.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>First, with the rhetorical questions, What,</p>
<p>then, is Apollos? And what is Paul?, the apostle sets up an answer that de-</p>
<p>ates status seeking and competition—Paul and Apollos are lowly servants </p>
<p>through whom the Corinthians believed the gospel.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>e congregation</p>
<p>must envision their leaders being no better than slaves and day-laborers, </p>
<p>the very people despised by elitists and sophists who pride themselves in </p>
<p>not working with their hands.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p> Second, the Lord has given Paul and Apol-</p>
los their assigned roles; both of them are God’s coworkers under divine
<p>authority and belonging to God (3:5c; 3:9a).</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>eir unique gis are given</p>
<p>by God who increases their produce, and if God is doing the work through </p>
<p>them and granting it success, this leaves no room for boasting in human </p>
<p>talent. ird, Paul and Apollos are one; they are unied in laboring for the </p>
<p>Corinthians’ spiritual growth (3:5, 8a). Paul planted by rst evangelizing </p>
<p>the Corinthians (Acts 18), and Apollos watered aerward by nurturing </p>
<p>them (Acts 19:1). Auditors can draw the inference that Paul, not Apollos, </p>
<p>is founder of their congregation, and yet they are equal despite dierent </p>
<p>roles.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>Fourth, the one who evaluates Paul and Apollos’s work should not</p>
<p>be the Corinthians, but God. ese workers, who get paid at the end of the </p>
<p>“day,” will receive their own reward from God for their own labor, which </p>
