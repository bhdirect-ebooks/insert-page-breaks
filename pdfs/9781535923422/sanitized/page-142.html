<p>55</p>
<p>Second,</p>
<p>he probably thinks that too much dependence on others’ nances could </p>
<p>slow down his missionary agenda. He would have to spend added time </p>
<p>requesting, collecting, and relying on money from congregations before </p>
<p>advancing to new territory. If some were unable to pay up aer committing </p>
<p>to do so, this would cause further delays. ird, Paul’s policy spares poorer </p>
<p>members from being burdened by supporting him nancially (1 ess 2:9; </p>
<p>2 ess 3:8; 2 Cor 11:9; 12:13–16).</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>Fourth, this congregation is simply too</p>
<p>immature to handle sponsoring Paul without it aecting them negatively. </p>
<p>ey would likely boast about it or feel that Paul now “owes” them. Finally, </p>
<p>Paul may want to dierentiate his ministry from sophists whom the Cor-</p>
<p>inthians are so prone to admire and who speak for exorbitant fees (see 1 </p>
<p>Cor 2 Excursus). Paul’s manual labor was not tting for these orators who </p>
<p>normally despise such work (Philostratus, Vit. soph. 2.615; Philo Det. 34).</p>
<p>Our apostle’s insistence on refusing material support forms a com-</p>
<p>bined chiasm:</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>A. Paul does not take advantage of his right for support (9:12b)</p>
<p>B. Temple workers live o of temple oerings (9:13)</p>

<p>Point A repeats Paul’s policy of rejecting support from the Corinthians.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is is central to the passage as is his compulsion to proclaim the gospel in </p>
<p>point C. </p>
<p>e question in 9:13, Do you not know? implies, “you ought to know” </p>
<p>(see 3:16). Paul argues for apostolic rights using an analogy. As ministers in </p>
<p>Jerusalem partake of food from the temple and alter (Num 18:8–19; Deut </p>

<p>56. Ibid.</p>
<p>57. Bailey 2011:249, is similar though “commission” dubiously guides his point at </p>
<p>9:17.</p>
<p>58. Notice “for” (γάρ) appears ve times in 9:15–17, underscoring Paul’s refusal to </p>
<p>use his right.</p>
