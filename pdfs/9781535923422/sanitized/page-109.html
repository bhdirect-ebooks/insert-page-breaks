<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>85</p>
<p>in Christ is at stake; as fornicators they are in danger of perishing with the </p>
<p>fornicators of this world (6:9–10).</p>
<p>e second thing the Corinthians should know is that the man who </p>
<p>joins himself with a prostitute is one body with her, sharing solidarity </p>
<p>with her. is perspective is reminiscent of the way sexual unions with out-</p>
siders deled God’s people both individually and as a group (Jub. 30.7–17;
<p>Jos. Ant. 4.126–158; Num 25). e prostitute represents the fallen world </p>
<p>and age that passes away at Christ’s return. is unholy union joins both </p>
<p>physical bodies along with all their spiritual connections.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>e saints thus</p>
<p>join themselves to the realm that opposes Christ, and another identity is </p>
<p>formed through the sexual union.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>is unication apes the story of the</p>
<p>original man and woman as Paul cites from Genesis: the two shall be one </p>
<p>esh (cf. Gen 2:24).</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> What originally described a sacred union that con-</p>
<p>stitutes marriage is now contaminated by Corinthian fornication with out-</p>
<p>siders. e union in Genesis is properly analogous to the union between </p>
<p>the Corinthians and Jesus, who are one Spirit with him.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>Paul deploys an</p>
<p>argument from lesser to greater—if a man joined to a wife is not to be in </p>
<p>union with a prostitute, how much more believers who are joined to Christ </p>
<p>through one Spirit?</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>Paul works with the assumption of family imagery</p>
<p>in which Christ is the husband of believers (2 Cor 11:2–3; Rom 7:4; cf. Eph </p>
<p>5:21–23; Isa 54:5), and as such, the believer’s body belongs to its rightful </p>
<p>spouse (6:13c, 19; 7:4). </p>
<p>e third thing the Corinthians should know is that each Corinthian </p>
<p>body is a temple of the Holy Spirit. Epictetus the Stoic philosopher has a </p>
<p>similar view: </p>
<p>When you are in conjunction with a woman . . . know you not </p>
<p>that you are nourishing a god, that you are exercising a god? </p>
<p>Wretch, you are carrying about a god with you, and you know </p>
<p>it not. Do you think that I mean some God of silver or of gold, </p>
<p>and external? You carry him within yourself, and you perceive </p>
<p>not that you are polluting him by impure thoughts and dirty </p>
<p>deeds. And if an image of God were present, you would not </p>
<p>dare to do any of the things which you are doing: but when </p>
<p>God himself is present within and sees all and hears all, you are </p>
<p>not ashamed of thinking such things and doing such things, </p>

<p>99. See Schnabel 2006:341; Merklein 2000:2.76.</p>
<p>100. e ambiguous φησίν “it says” or “he says” introduces the quote. If the latter, </p>
<p>perhaps Jesus is meant (Matt 19:5). </p>
