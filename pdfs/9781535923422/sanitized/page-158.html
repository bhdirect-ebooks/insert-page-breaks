<p>ird Supporting Proof (8:1—11:1)</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>Communion with demons can happen by partnering with idolaters and </p>
<p>sharing their cultic food as they make oerings to deities that demons co-</p>
<p>opt. If the Corinthians participate in such cultic meals repeatedly, this may </p>
<p>desensitize them to the peril they face.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p> is inadvertent devotion to de-</p>
<p>mons is idolatry and a breach of covenant faithfulness to God.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul follows up with two rhetorical questions. e rst, do we con-</p>
<p>tinue to provoke the Lord to jealousy? expects no for an answer.</p>
<p>143</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>auditors are to recognize that eating idol meats in this predicament incites </p>
<p>the Lord to respond with judgment. ese words allude to Israel provok-</p>
<p>ing the Lord to jealousy by their idols and worship of that which is not </p>
<p>God (Deut 32:19–21; cf. Num 25:10–17; Ps 106:28).</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>e provocation</p>
<p>assumes a violation of God’s covenant and commands for his people to </p>
<p>have no other gods and no graven images (Deut 5:7–9; Exod 20:3–5). Di-</p>
<p>vine punishment ensues from the Lord because of this. e second ques-</p>
<p>tion, we are not stronger than he, are we? is written with irony directed </p>
<p>at the strong members and expects the reply, “No we are not.” e ques-</p>
<p>tion has the goal of putting them to shame since they presently think too </p>
<p>highly of themselves as being immune to idolatry. In Paul’s ironic twist, </p>
<p>they have so much knowledge and power that they can even dispute the </p>
<p>Lord!</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>Realistically, though, Paul knows through the subtexts he uses</p>
<p>that the Lord shows himself as a strong rock while the people and all other </p>
<p>forces are impotent by comparison (Deut 32:30, 36–39).</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>e Lord and</p>
<p>king of glory is “strong and mighty” and the whole earth belongs to him </p>
<p>(Ps 24:1, 8, 10; cf. 1 Cor 10:26).</p>
<p>Further Circumstances Regarding Idol Foods </p>
<p>and a Recapitulation (10:23—11:1)</p>
<p>Paul appeals to common advantage as he responds again to the Corinthian </p>
<p>assumption that all things are permissible for them (see 6:12). He qualies </p>
<p>their saying by claiming that not all things are benecial. Even though eat-</p>
<p>ing idol foods is permissible for strong members, it may not be expedient </p>
<p>141. See Works 2014:113–14.</p>
<p>142. Phua 2005:170 is similar and adds that idolatry can also be “dishonouring the </p>
<p>true God through the cognitive error of mixing or confusing God” with other deities or </p>
<p>demons, along with “wrong kinds of worship.”</p>
<p>143. With “we” Paul rhetorically includes himself among the strong.</p>
144. See Waters 2006:132–48. On divine marital jealousy, see Ezek 16:38; 23:25;
<p>Gardner 1994:171.</p>
<p>145. Contrast Isa 45:9; Eccl 6:10; Job 9:32.</p>
<p>146. See Ciampa/Rosner 2010:483–84.</p>
