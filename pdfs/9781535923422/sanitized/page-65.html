<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>one who operates by God’s Spirit) examines and understands all things. </p>
<p>Because this person has God’s Spirit, who investigates all things pertaining </p>
to God’s own hidden thoughts and salvic plan (2:10), this individual real-
<p>izes and receives all the benets God has for him or her (cf. 3:21–22). </p>
<p>Conversely, the spiritual person is examined and understood by no one </p>
<p>who is not spiritual. In other words, the natural person is not in a position to </p>
<p>discern and judge the spiritual person. What does Paul have in mind? ere </p>
<p>are three prominent possibilities. e rst imagines persecution. Paul may be </p>
<p>aware of an oral tradition that assured the persecuted believer of being en-</p>
<p>dowed with wise speech originating from God’s Spirit that the rulers, judges, </p>
<p>and leaders they stand before will not be able to gainsay (Matt 10:19–20; Luke </p>
<p>12:11–12; 21:12–15). Perhaps, too, Paul implies that the rulers of this age were </p>
<p>in no spiritual position to sentence Jesus to death (cf. 2:8). A second option </p>
<p>functions as a prelude to passages such as 4:1–5 and 9:3 where Paul, who spiri-</p>
<p>tually has the mind of Christ, discourages the Corinthians from criticizing </p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>eir behavior shows that they evaluate things by worldly standards of</p>
<p>this age, and so they are not in a position to examine his abilities—the Lord </p>
<p>will be his judge instead. A third possibility anticipates the content of 6:1–8. </p>
<p>Paul anticipates correcting the Corinthian assumption that magistrates void </p>
<p>of God’s Spirit should be judging cases between congregation members who </p>
<p>do have God’s Spirit. Possibly a combination of these options is meant. </p>
<p>e apostle concludes this passage by quoting Isaiah with the inquiry, </p>
<p>Who has known the mind of the Lord that he will instruct him? (cf. Isa </p>
<p>40:13).</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>e context in Isaiah highlights the knowledge and power of God</p>
<p>as creator over the nations (40:12–15). What is stressed is that if no one is </p>
<p>able to measure God’s creation, how much less could anyone hope to know </p>
<p>or measure the mind of God?</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>is question expects the answer “no one”</p>
<p>but receives instead the outlandish claim that the Spirit-led are able to re-</p>
ceive divine thoughts (cf. 1 Cor 2:10–11). Paul plays on the title “Lord” from
<p>Isa 40:13, which originally refers to God, but as usual he gives this title to </p>
<p>Christ: we have the mind of Christ.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>is grand image of Paul’s, of the Lord</p>
<p>person (Lambrecht 2013:367–70, responding to Dingeldein 2013:31–44). Incidentally, </p>
<p>ἀνακρίνω appears three times in 2:14–15 with Paul playing on its meaning that ranges </p>
<p>from “discern” to “judge.” Perhaps the most consistent sense is “examine and under-</p>
<p>stand” (Ellingworth/Hatton 1995:62). </p>
<p>92. Fee 1987:118–19.</p>
<p>93. In this verse the MT has “spirit (חור) of Yahweh,” whereas the LXX has “mind </p>
<p>(νοῦς) of the Lord.” e latter adds aer Lord, “and who has become his counsellor . . . ”</p>
<p>94. Inkelaar 2011:258, is similar.</p>
<p>95. Capes 1992:140, notices Isa 40:13 in Rom 11:34 has the Lord as God, but in 1 </p>
<p>Cor 2:16 the Lord is Christ. </p>
