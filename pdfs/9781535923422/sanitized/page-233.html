<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>

<p>Lord to the glory of God the Father (Phil 2:9–11; cf. Gal 1:3–5; Rom 16:27).</p>

<p> </p>
<p>is enthronement exhibits a king who has routed all foes and now willingly </p>
<p>gives gis to the deity he represents that enabled his victory. In this case </p>
<p>Christ gives back all that originally belonged to God but was lost apparently </p>
<p>through Adam. Paul’s imagined triumph subverts the power of Roman ide-</p>
<p>ology not only by replacing Caesar with Jesus and Jupiter with God, but also </p>
<p>by portraying the entire creation under God’s rule with His Son as viceroy </p>
<p>who forever was, is, and remains the mediating creator of all things (8:4–6; </p>
<p>cf. Col 1:15–18; 3:11; Eph 1:22–23). e subjection is so that God may be </p>
<p>all in all (cf. Rom 9:5; 11:36).</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>e curse of sin and death, and principalities</p>
<p>and powers, human and demonic, and all things that were separate from the </p>
<p>Creator are reversed and now subjected to and in perfect alignment with the </p>
<p>will, purpose, and sovereignty of God.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>Cosmic harmony is fully restored</p>
as God rules unchallenged over all things and the divine presence dwells
<p>among all things.</p>
<p>Exhortations and Supporting Arguments Related to </p>
<p>Resurrection (15:29–34)</p>
<p>e following verses raise four questions aimed at persuading against resur-</p>
<p>rection denial. For Paul this denial encourages unethical behavior, and so </p>
<p>he includes some moral imperatives in this section. e rst and second </p>
<p>questions relate to baptism: what will those be doing who are baptized </p>
<p>for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are they baptized for </p>
<p>them? Among the numerous speculations about the meaning of baptism for </p>
<p>the dead, two options stand out in my view.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>e rst is that “for” (ὑπέρ)</p>
<p>suggests vicarious baptism “in place of” another person who has already </p>
<p>died.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>e believer is baptized again in proxy of an unbaptized dead person,</p>
<p>so that the unbaptized person might be saved and it go well with him or </p>
<p>58. Richardson 1994:114–15; Ciampa/Rosner 2010:778.</p>
<p>59. e nal “all” (πᾶσιν) is a comprehensive neuter suggesting “both persons and </p>
<p>things” (Robertson/Plummer 1925:358). e totality should be understood salvically </p>
<p>rather than metaphysically (Barrett 1968:361).</p>
<p>60. e opposing forces, then, must either be converted, bound, or destroyed.</p>
<p>61. For surveys of interpretation, see White 2012; Hull 2005:7–47; Wol 1996:392–</p>
<p>96. Hull presents another alternative—Paul refers to those being baptized on account </p>
<p>of their faith in Christ being raised from the dead and that “the dead in Christ are </p>
<p>destined for resurrection” (235). Such a group, as Cameron/Miller 2011:284 note, tends </p>
<p>to promote a Pauline baptismal faction when Paul opposes such factions (1:10–13).</p>
<p>62. E.g., Sharp 2014:36–66; DeMaris 1995:661–82. Compare Judas Maccabeus’s </p>
<p>supplication and a sin oering for his soldiers that already died; the assumption is that </p>
<p>they will rise again (2 Macc 12:39–45).</p>
