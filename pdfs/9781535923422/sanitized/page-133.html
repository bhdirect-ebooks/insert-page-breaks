<p>Although Paul will mention that demons can be present with</p>
<p>idols (10:20–21), he never claims they are actual gods. And while Satan and </p>
<p>the lawless man whom Satan inuences are called god (2 Cor 4:4; 2 ess </p>
<p>2:3–4), this designation for them is in the singular, relative to the fallen </p>
<p>world, and hence, shown to be a false and temporal claim that opposes the </p>
<p>only true God by nature (2 ess 2:8; Rom 16:20; cf. Gal 4:8–9).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Along with the many gods worshipped in Corinth, congregation </p>
<p>members would be aware of the imperial cult and its veneration of Augus-</p>
tus among many lords and divinities (8:5).
<p>9</p>
<p> As well, the lords Paul men-</p>
<p>tions might include apotheosized heroes such as Hercules and Asclepius; </p>
and the term also was related to divinities among Egyptians, Syrians, and
<p>racians.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Even so, Paul may be informed by Deut 10:17 where God is</p>
<p>“God of gods and Lord of lords.” In this light his language reects rhetorical </p>
<p>motivation—the many gods and lords in the cosmos highlight the contrast </p>
<p>between these powers and Paul’s one deity and lord who created the cos-</p>
<p>mos: But for us there is one God, the Father from whom are all things, </p>
<p>and we to Him, and one Lord Jesus Christ through whom are all things, </p>
<p>and we through him. In this reconguration of the Shema, it appears as </p>
<p>though Paul (or an earlier Christian tradition he recites) has split “the Lord </p>
<p>your God is one Lord” from Deut 6:4 (LXX) and attributed “God” to the </p>
<p>Father and God’s name as “Lord” to Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>e one God, as it were,</p>
<p>becomes both the one Father and one Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>God is the Father</p>
<p>and creator of all things in heaven and earth which derived their existence </p>
<p>from (ἐκ) Him, and it was through (διά) the agency of the preexistent Lord </p>
<p>Jesus Christ that this was accomplished (cf. Col 1:15–18). e created order </p>
<p>also progresses to (εἰς) God through the Lord Jesus, which anticipates the </p>
<p>new creation as the old creation’s goal (2 Cor 5:17).</p>

<p>8. Although it can be argued that, given the similar terminology of the “rulers of </p>
<p>this age” (2:6, 8) and “rulers and authorities” (Col 2:15; cf. 2:20; Eph 6:12), the demons </p>
<p>might refer to the “many lords” mentioned by Paul, Paul never actually uses “lord” </p>
<p>(κύριος) to designate demons or Satan, unless here. Contrast Shen 2010:143, 146, 200.</p>
<p>9. e phrase “many lords” does not resemble well merely the Caesars because only </p>
<p>several had reigned by Paul’s time. Although Winter 2001:272–74, 282, gives evidence </p>
<p>that members of the imperial family were also venerated, more than simply the impe-</p>
<p>rial household is meant given the vast number of deities and lords known to Paul and </p>
<p>the Corinthians. </p>
