<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>

<p>nothing—I am “spiritually zero.”</p>
<p>165</p>
<p>e gi of generosity (Rom 12:8) is</p>
<p>described in sacricial terms and enables Paul to dole out all my posses-</p>
<p>sions to the poor and surrender my body that I may boast.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p>Paul speaks</p>
<p>of his body becoming a living sacrice for the gospel’s sake, which entails </p>
<p>suering (Rom 12:1; 2 Cor 11:23–33), and his boast anticipates a reward </p>
<p>for his labor at the second coming (3:14; Phil 2:16–17).</p>
<p>167</p>
<p> is is reminis-</p>
<p>cent of Jesus’s promises that those who give up their possessions to follow </p>
<p>him will be rewarded, whether in this life or the next (Mark 10:28–30; Luke </p>
<p>12:32–33; 18:22). All the same, sacricial giving without love provides no </p>
<p>such benet for the giver.</p>
<p>Love is personied and stands for someone characterized by love in </p>
<p>13:4–7.</p>
<p>168</p>
<p>e placement of the phrase love waits patiently and shows</p>
<p>kindness at the beginning of Paul’s list underscores Corinthian necessity to </p>
<p>behave with such virtues when gathering together for church and operat-</p>
<p>ing in spiritual gis. ey must be patient and kind, for example, to every </p>
<p>member and wait their turn to share a spiritual word (14:26–31), along with </p>
<p>being courteous to weak and poor members (8:7–13; 11:33–34; 12:21–24). </p>
<p>More generally, patience is required through suering and working with </p>
<p>others (Rom 12:12; 1 ess 5:14–15).</p>
<p>169</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e next eight descriptors each use a negative particle (οὐ) and may </p>
<p>aim to discourage various shortcomings in the congregation. at love </p>
<p>does not stir envy challenges their discordant behavior in 3:3. Love does </p>
<p>not brag and is not pued up discourages their attitude of arrogance and </p>
<p>thinking themselves superior to others (4:6–7; 8:1–2). Love does not be-</p>
<p>have indecently confronts sexual impropriety (7:36), and love seeks not its </p>
<p>own recalls their need to alter selshness ways in table fellowship (10:24, 33; </p>
<p>11:33–34). If love were the Greek word ἔρως, perhaps it would desire to seek </p>
<p>its own, as in myths of the god Eros, who as a suitor seeks to possess objects </p>
<p>for self-gratication. Paul instead identies love in opposition to self-love.</p>

<p>e idea of love not being provoked to anger may discourage irritability </p>

<p>166. Certain manuscripts have “that I should be burned” (ἵνα καυθήσομαι: e.g., C, </p>
<p>D; cf. NKJV, ESV), which emphasizes persecution and martyrdom (e.g., 2 Macc 7:4–5). </p>
<p>However, “that I may boast” (ἵνα καυχήσωμαι) has more reliable manuscript support </p>
<p>(see Malone 2009:401–6), and it makes better sense to suggest that later scribes had </p>
<p>altered the perplexing “boast” to “burn” rather than the reverse (Hays 1997:225).</p>
<p>167. Ciampa/Rosner 2010:637, are similar but highlight that martyrdom is still </p>
<p>meant (2 Tim 4:6). </p>
