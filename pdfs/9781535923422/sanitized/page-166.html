<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>

<p>but this passage is not about submission but gender distinction.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Although</p>
<p>the meaning as “source” promotes gender equality, it lacks well-established </p>
<p>lexical support.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>e third choice nds sucient support. It is in keeping</p>
<p>with metaphors of the ancient body—the head oen conveys the “topmost” </p>
<p>and leadership of the body (Philo Mos. 2.30; Seneca Clem. 1.3.5; Galen De </p>
<p>Usu Partium 1.445.14–17).</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the position of prominence or</p>
<p>“top” seems to include the idea of authority related to leadership in many </p>
<p>source instances, a point that A. C. Perriman admits but adds that κεφαλή </p>
<p>“cannot be thought to introduce in any a priori or necessary manner ideas </p>
<p>of authority or sovereignty into the text.”</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>While his point may be valid,</p>
<p>headship in 11:3 includes God and Christ, and so the idea of them being </p>
topmost or preeminent cannot be easily divorced from the notion of lead-ership, which in turn cannot be easily divorced from some sense of author-
<p>ity. I doubt that Paul’s ancient audience would dierentiate and exclude </p>
<p>certain of these nuances from the term the way we do today, or attribute the </p>
<p>nuances only to Christ and God but not the man. Moreover, it is dicult </p>
<p>to accept that headship as “source” can be entirely extricated from this pas-</p>
<p>sage given that Paul arms that the woman originates from the man, and </p>
<p>vice/verse (11:8–9, 12).</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I suggest, then, that Paul’s use of the metaphor “head” in 11:3 is multi-</p>
<p>valent; it is an image to be visualized, and though it best represents the nu-</p>
<p>ance of topmost, this does not necessarily exclude other meanings. We can </p>
<p>acknowledge that in Paul’s patriarchal world, and in agreement with Paul’s </p>
<p>gender order from Genesis, it made perfect sense to have the man as the </p>
<p>head (topmost and prominent person) of the home. If this idea also carries </p>
<p>with it any sense of leadership and authority, we should remember that this </p>
<p>ancient world for most people, unlike westerners today, was one in which </p>
<p>survival and provisions could not be taken for granted. Since husbands and </p>
<p>fathers had more brute strength than their wives and children, and were </p>
<p>normally more skilled and educated, they were the most t to lead, protect, </p>
<p>and provide for their family and ensure its survival. Even so, like the Jesus </p>
<p>tradition that probably informs him, Paul regards the notion of leadership in </p>
<p>terms of serving others rather than being served (3:5; 4:1; cf. Mark 9:34–35; </p>
<p>10:42–45; Matt 23:11–12), and headship similarly involves a concentrated </p>
<p>5. See criticisms of the authority view in Perriman 1994:602–10; Garland </p>
<p>2003:514–15. </p>

<p>21–23).</p>
