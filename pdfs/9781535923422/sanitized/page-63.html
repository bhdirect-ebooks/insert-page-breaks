<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>Scripture allusions in 2:6–8 are interwoven with his artistic argument, </p>
<p>but now in 2:9 he presents an inartistic proof in the form of an oracle or </p>
<p>testimony of the ancients, by using an explicit citation formula, just as it is </p>
<p>written. e citation in 2:9 may be loosely referencing a string of scriptures </p>
emphasizing divine revelation: what eye has not seen and ear has not heard
<p>(Isa 64:3[4]), nor has entered into the heart of humans (65:17) what God </p>
<p>has prepared for those who love him (Sir 1:10). Another possibility is that </p>
<p>he cites from a text no longer extant. Pseudo-Philo L.A.B. 26.13 and 1 Clem. </p>
<p>34.8 may be two independent sources that cite from such a text.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>If the Isaiah</p>
<p>texts are primarily in view, their context and thematic parallels may imply </p>
<p>that in the anticipated era of restoration and new creation, God’s people who </p>
<p>were spiritually blind will once again see and hear, along with Gentiles, and </p>
<p>be saved (33:17–22; 40:5; 52:10, 15; 66:18–19).</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>For Paul, in any case, now</p>
<p>that the Christ event has taken place, the anticipated era is currently being </p>
<p>fullled. Christ’s followers can now “see” and “hear” (i.e., understand) the pro-</p>
<p>found revelation of God’s salvic plan and spiritual benets pertaining to it.</p>
<p>His citation is followed up by an analogy between God’s Spirit and the </p>
<p>human spirit along with three guiding antitheses contrasting worldly and </p>
<p>spiritual-revelatory wisdom—the spirit of the world/the Spirit which comes </p>
<p>from God, human teaching/spiritual teaching, and the natural (soulish) </p>
<p>person/extra-natural (spiritual) person (2:10–15). He advances a rhetorical </p>
<p>question that prompts the response that no one knows the things of a hu-</p>
<p>man (i.e., one’s inner thoughts, plans, and intentions) except the spirit of </p>
<p>that human. is is not referring to the Holy Spirit but the “I” or inner self </p>
<p>of humans that engages the mind though not equated with it (14:14; 16:18; </p>
<p>Rom 8:16; 2 Cor 12:2–3).</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>en from lesser to greater Paul argues that the</p>
<p>things of God no one could know, except the Spirit of God who searches </p>
<p>God’s thoughts, plans, and intentions, the depths of God.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>And such plans</p>
<p>and thoughts are disclosed to those who are in Christ.</p>
<p>e rst antithesis arms that we have not received the spirit of the </p>
<p>world but the Spirit who is from God. In Pauline cosmology this phrase </p>
<p>82. Cf. Clivaz/Schulthess 2015:192, 199. Origen and Ambrosiaster believed Paul </p>
<p>was referencing the Apocalypse of Elijah (Bray 1999:23). For further parallels, see Wil-</p>
<p>liams 2001:175–99; Berger 1978:270–83.</p>
<p>83. Contrast God’s people previously being blind and deaf (Isa 6:10; 29:9–14; </p>
<p>30:9–11; 42:18–20).</p>
<p>84. is “I” or self, whether immaterial or of airy material (as some ancients taught: </p>
<p>Martin 1995:6–15), also survives death (2 Cor 5:6–8), and may ow through, link with, </p>
<p>seat, or be the “stu” of the human mind/intellect.</p>
<p>85. Cf. Rom 11:33–34; Jdt 8:14; T.Job 37.6; Fitzmyer 2008:180.</p>
