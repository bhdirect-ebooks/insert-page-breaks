<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>187</p>
<p>prevents the long-winded prophet from taking up too much time.</p>
<p>240</p>
<p>It also</p>
<p>assumes that the prophecy is spontaneous; they are prompted by the Spirit to </p>
<p>speak.</p>
<p>241</p>
<p>Paul emphasizes prophecy in relation to teaching and exhortation:</p>
<p>that all may learn and all may be encouraged (14:31 cf. 14:3). </p>
<p>By his claim that the spirits of the prophets are subject to the proph-</p>
<p>ets, Paul means again the human spirit of each prophet, the innermost self </p>
<p>(see 14:14–15).</p>
<p>242</p>
<p>e human spirit is the primary modem through which</p>
<p>God’s Spirit prompts inspired communication. is makes perfect sense of </p>
<p>the necessity for prophets to control themselves and be silent while letting </p>
<p>another person who is prompted by the Spirit to speak. e person who </p>
<p>prophesies is in control of his or her own spirit so that there is no basis </p>
<p>for a lack of self-control or excusing one’s disorderly conduct by saying, “I </p>
<p>couldn’t help myself; the Spirit takes a hold of me, and I’m not in control </p>
<p>anymore!”</p>
<p>243</p>
<p>Orderly worship is conrmed in 14:33a: For God is not (the</p>
<p>God) of disorder but of peace. A tumultuous zoo of disorderly worship </p>
<p>is not honoring to God who characterizes peace, a virtue which for the </p>
<p>Corinthians in this situation suggests a state of harmony and “good order.”</p>
<p>244</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e tag, as in all the churches of the saints (14:33b), probably goes with </p>
<p>the preceding rather than subsequent thoughts. Elsewhere, Paul connects </p>
<p>similar phrases to concluding statements rather than commencing new </p>
<p>ones (4:17; 7:17; 11:6).</p>
<p>245</p>
<p>Hence, orderly worship typies the behavior of all</p>
<p>churches, and the Corinthian congregation should be no exception.</p>
<p>Many interpreters question how Paul could write about silencing </p>
<p>women in 14:34–35, when in 11:5 he permits women to prophesy. Some </p>
<p>argue that these verses are an interpolation added by a later editor.</p>
<p>246</p>
<p> In-</p>
<p>deed, certain Western manuscripts place these verses aer 14:40, enabling </p>
<p>the possibility that they were added originally as a marginal gloss in one </p>
<p>of the letter’s copies, and that gloss was eventually added to the main text. </p>
<p>Antoinette Wire, however, evinces that the variant manuscripts all seem to </p>
<p>have “originated from a single displacement” that may have originated from </p>
<p>240. Forbes 1997:262.</p>
<p>241. Hiu 2010:102; Dunn 1975:228.</p>
<p>242. Pace Tibbs 2006:52; iselton 2000:973.</p>
<p>243. Such claims indeed were used to justify charismatic disorder in the 1990s (see </p>
<p>Oropeza 1996; 2002b:137–50).</p>
<p>244. BDAG 287.</p>
<p>245. See further points in Hiu 2010:136–37; Fee 1987:697–98. Hiu arms that “as” </p>
<p>(ὡς) typically does not begin a new sentence when it belongs to a dependent clause </p>
<p>without a verb.</p>
