<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>In Jewish tradition a person who desecrated God’s temple or holy ob-</p>
<p>jects may be put to death (e.g., 2 Sam 6:6–7), and an inscription at Herod’s </p>
<p>temple warned Gentiles of this same fate if they entered the balustrade of the </p>
<p>sanctuary (Jos. Bell. 6.2.4).</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> It is in this sense of holiness that Paul’s warn-</p>
<p>ing becomes lucid. Any Corinthian among them who damages or destroys </p>
God’s temple—that is, anyone whose divisive and immoral behavior causes
<p>fellow members to stumble in their faith—God will destroy that person. </p>
<p>e indenite anyone (τις) in 3:17 recalls the same pronoun in 3:12, 14–15, </p>
<p>all of which refer to believers. ose who are susceptible to destruction are </p>
<p>not outsiders, but insiders, the Corinthian believers. e congregation’s </p>
<p>problem involves members harming other members (e.g., 8:7–13). e </p>
<p>idea of reciprocating destruction recalls the lex talionis principle of ruin for </p>
<p>ruin,</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>and is akin with the common adage, “whoever does x will receive</p>
<p>x.”</p>
<p>141</p>
e notion of recompense is clear, and since Paul is referring to divine
<p>judgment, what may be foremost elicited is that on judgment day when </p>
<p>Christ returns, everyone will receive as their works deserve, whether good </p>
<p>or bad (2 Cor 5:10; Rom 2:6, 16; 14:12; Col 3:25; cf. Jer 32:19; Job 34:11; </p>
<p>1 En. 100.7). Consequently, this punishment is more than merely physical </p>
<p>death.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p> It refers to eschatological destruction on judgment day.</p>
<p>143</p>
<p>It follows</p>
<p>that the one who damages the temple where the life-giving Spirit dwells will </p>
<p>be severed from the Spirit and that life which the Spirit gives.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>Exhortations against Boasting (3:18–23)</p>
<p>With further imperatives Paul discourages his auditors from self-deception </p>
<p>and boasting. With let no one deceive himself, one of the main causes of </p>
<p>potential damage to the temple’s holiness is evident—some of its members </p>
<p>have been misled to follow and emulate an ideology that exemplies the </p>
<p>wise in this age and wisdom of this world, which as we already explored </p>
<p>(1:18–21; 2:6–8), helps instigate factions. e apostle now challenges the </p>
<p>Corinthians to abandon this inuence—if any among them want to be wise, </p>
<p>139. See Deissmann, 1965:79–81.</p>
<p>140. Yinger 1999:225.</p>
<p>141. See on the former point, Yinger 1999:225, and the latter, Keener 2005:43 (cf. </p>
<p>Prov 26:27; Sir 27:25–27).</p>
<p>142. Rightly, Konradt 2003:278. </p>
<p>143. See “destroy” (φθείρω) in end-time judgment in Jude 10; 2 Pet 2:12. e term </p>
<p>can alternatively mean “to corrupt” in a moral sense (Liu 2013:122–23), and so there is </p>
<p>a possible play on the word φθείρω: “if anyone corrupts God’s temple, God will destroy </p>
<p>that person.”</p>
<p>144. Cf. iselton 2000:318.</p>
