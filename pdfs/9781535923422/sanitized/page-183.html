<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>

<p>D. Questions prompting explanation of many members in the </p>
<p>body (12:17–20)</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>. Statements denying the unsuitability of certain body parts </p>
<p>(12:21–24)</p>

<p>. Solidary of members as the one body of Christ (12:25–27)</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>. Variety of spiritual gis semi-ranked (12:28–30)</p>
<p>e center of the chiasm stresses that members comprise the one body of </p>
<p>Christ and are placed in their respective locations by God and not them-</p>
<p>selves. Hence, they should neither boast nor be ashamed of their place or </p>
<p>gis in the body.</p>
<p>Paul’s opening words, now concerning spiritual things (πνευματικός), </p>
<p>may suggest he is responding to another correspondence question from </p>
<p>the Corinthians (see 7:1). His stress on mutuality, bodily edication, and </p>
<p>ranking of spiritual gis betrays a competitive atmosphere among members </p>
<p>who probably boast of their spiritual endowments (14:36–37).</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>Another</p>
<p>problem includes disorderliness (14:33, 40). Other issues, if Chris Forbes is </p>
<p>correct, center on their speaking in tongues without intelligible interpreta-</p>
<p>tion, their continuing this practice before outsiders, and their prophesying </p>
<p>in a manner that discourages discernment of what is spoken (e.g., 14:1–5, </p>
<p>23, 29).</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>e term πνευματικός may be the Corinthians’ preferred word</p>
<p>for manifestations of spirituality, whereas Paul prefers using “spiritual gis” </p>
<p>(χάρισματα 12:4, 9, 28, 30–31), which highlight spiritual manifestations as </p>
<p>graciously given by God.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>God is the benefactor of those to whom these</p>
<p>gis are given, and the clients are expected to reciprocate honor, praise, and </p>
<p>gratitude to the gi-giver and likewise reect generosity by sharing what </p>
<p>was given with others.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul writes, I do not want you to be ignorant about spiritual matters, </p>
<p>which is a humbling reminder that his auditors need spiritual direction.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ey were at one time Gentiles, formerly idolaters who did not know God. </p>
<p>But as believers they (should) no longer do things that characterize unbe-</p>
<p>lieving Gentiles (cf. Eph 2:1–3, 11–12; 4:17–19). ey formerly were (led </p>
<p>away) to mute idols, descriptive of the idols’ lifeless incommunicable state </p>
<p>97. Garland 2003:558, suggests their question is, “What spiritual gi is highest </p>
<p>and best?”</p>
