<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>104</p>
<p>Believers who get married are at a disadvantage because their time, inter-</p>
est, and concentration will be divided between the Lord and pleasing their
<p>spouse, not to mention caring for their children that will come later on in </p>
<p>life. Virgin believers, on the other hand, can spend more time being devoted </p>
<p>and of service to the Lord, and unmarried females also focus on being holy </p>
<p>in body (i.e., keeping chaste) and in spirit (i.e., having purity of thoughts, </p>
<p>emotions, and volition; cf. 2 Cor 7:1; 1 ess 5:23).</p>
<p>Paul then addresses the betrothed male (7:36–37) and father of the </p>
<p>virgin daughter (7:38). e betrothed risks behaving indecently toward his </p>
<p>virgin (7:36b);</p>
<p>187</p>
<p> he behaves in a manner sexually inappropriate.</p>
<p>188</p>
<p>Some</p>
<p>examples of indecency include the way Philip of Macedonia sits with his tu-</p>
<p>nic pulled up and exposed before his subjects (Plutarch, [Reg. imp. apophth.] </p>
<p>178D), a courtesan disallowing her lover to behave indecently under a por-</p>
<p>trait of the chaste Xenocrates (Plutarch Fragmata 85), and the utterance </p>
<p>of licentious phrases (Dio Chrysostom, Or. 40.29). Winter stresses sexual </p>
<p>respectability was the Roman norm for engaged couples.</p>
<p>189</p>
<p>And certainly,</p>
<p>Jewish sentiment promotes guarding virginity well (Sir 42:9–14; Ps.-Phoc. </p>
<p>Sent 215–17).</p>
<p>190</p>
<p>e extent to which intimacy might be a part of courtship</p>
<p>at this time is elusive. A period of “warming” is assumed by Ovid in which </p>
<p>kissing seems permissible (Her. 21.195–96),</p>
<p>191</p>
<p>but romantic literature of this</p>
<p>sort might be more the exception than rule. For Paul, the male’s indecency </p>
<p>could be anything from fondling his ancée inappropriately (if he were even </p>
<p>allowed to embrace her) to gazing at her and getting aroused because of it. </p>
<p>We simply do not know Paul’s thoughts on courtship boundaries.</p>
<p>192</p>
<p>Since</p>
<p>Paul wants virgins to remain virgins until marriage, he suggests that if the </p>
<p>male betrothed cannot keep his sexual urges in check he could go ahead and </p>
<p>get married. If he could remain self-controlled, however, he does well by </p>
<p>keeping his betrothed a virgin and not marry her. e multiple conditions </p>
<p>in which the betrothed stands rm in his heart, not having necessity but </p>
<p>has power over his own will, and has decided this in his own heart, are to </p>
<p>assure that he is absolutely sure about his decision to end the engagement. </p>
<p>187. ἀσχημονέω means “to behave disgracefully, dishonorably, indecently” (BDAG </p>
<p>147; cf. εὐσχήμων: 7:35: “proper”/”noble”/“appropriate”).</p>
<p>188. Winter 2001:243–46, shows that ἀσχημονέω and its cognates frequently have </p>
<p>sexual nuances. Dierently, in papyri material the term conveys non-sexual innuendos </p>
<p>(see Arzt-Grabner et al. 2006:310–11).</p>
