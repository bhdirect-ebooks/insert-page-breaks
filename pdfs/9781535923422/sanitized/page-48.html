<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>

<p>with true spiritual wisdom. ose who are perishing think the message of </p>
<p>the cross is foolishness. ey, too, have wisdom and power, but it is related </p>
<p>to rhetorical eloquence and the authority of Caesar (2:4–5, 8).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>ey belong</p>
<p>to the corrupted world and current age that found its inception through </p>
<p>the fall of Adam and the old creation, which characterizes sin and death, </p>
<p>belongs to Satan, and will ultimately meet its destruction in the age to come </p>
<p>(1:20–21a; cf. 5:5; 15:21–28; Rom 5:12–20). e Christ event marks the </p>
<p>inception of the new creation and salvic era invading the present world. </p>
<p>Its participants will experience the full realization of this salvation in the </p>
<p>age to come (Gal 1:4; 2 Cor 5:17; 6:2). e present tense of salvation and </p>
<p>destruction in 1:18, then, implies that both are currently in the process of </p>
<p>their respective states; their full realization does not take place until Christ </p>
<p>returns. Before that day arrives, the present state of the perishing ones </p>
<p>could be changed for the better if they start believing the message of the </p>
<p>cross. Conversely, those who believe must continue believing if they are to </p>
<p>experience nal salvation on that day.</p>
<p>is antithetical pairing of destruction and salvic life perhaps imag-</p>
<p>ines a triumphal procession similar to 2 Cor 2:14–16, where Paul classies </p>
<p>again two types of people using this similar terminology.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>e Corinthians,</p>
<p>highly inuenced by Roman culture, no doubt had heard of such proces-</p>
<p>sions in Rome, and knew of these events via depictions in art, inscriptions, </p>
<p>and literature.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>A victory celebration of this sort for Romans included the</p>
<p>victors of war entering and parading through their city on horses and chari-</p>
<p>ots complete with an entourage of statues, paintings, gold, silver, and other </p>
<p>booty, animals to be sacriced, incense bearers, and of course, prisoners </p>
<p>of war who were oen executed at the end of the spectacle (cf. Plutarch </p>
<p>Aem. 32.3–34.4).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>In this light, Christ’s death might be imagined in dierent</p>
<p>ways depending on the viewer. For those who are perishing, he resembles a </p>
<p>weak, Jewish rebel being crucied or, if in a triumphal procession is in view, </p>
<p>bound as a prisoner of war at the feet of the Roman emblem, the tropaion.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>3. cf. Arzt-Grabner et al. 2006:85. Dierently, Smit parallels Apollos’ name </p>
<p>(Ἀπολλῶς) with the concept of perishing (ἀπόλλυμι) to connect the perishing ones </p>
<p>with Apollos’s followers (2002:243–44). e Corinthian congregants, however, indis-</p>
<p>criminately belong to those who are called, believe, and are being saved, and this doubt-</p>
<p>less includes the Apollos group—they all belong to Christ (3:22–23; cf. 1:2).</p>
<p>4. In this text, however, God does the triumphal leading “in Christ” and Christ may </p>
<p>be imagined as the triumphant general.</p>

<p>7. e tropaion originally marked the turning point of a war when the enemy was </p>
<p>routed. It was placed at the location on the battleeld where this reversal of fortune </p>
