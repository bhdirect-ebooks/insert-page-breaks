<p>ird Supporting Proof (8:1—11:1)</p>

<p>here can only refer to salvic forfeiture. Even Paul has the potential to be-</p>
<p>come apostate.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>e apostle’s condence of his position in Christ, however,</p>
<p>makes it doubtful that he lost any sleep over this possibility. His point has </p>
<p>the rhetorical aim of unsettling the presumptuous security of the strong </p>
<p>members. If even an apostle can ultimately fail so as to be excluded from </p>
<p>futuristic benets in Christ, where does that leave them? ey must be </p>
<p>diligent to ensure that their consumption of idol meats does not result in </p>
idolatry and divine judgment (cf. 10:1–22). Moreover, since they insist on
<p>rather than limit their right to eat such food, Paul’s example functions as an </p>
<p>incentive for them to control themselves and relinquish their rights for the </p>
<p>sake of weak believers.</p>

<p>Wilderness Episodes as Warnings against Idolatry </p>
<p>and Vices (10:1–13)</p>
<p>e opening for (γάρ) connects this passage with 9:24–27 and continues the </p>
<p>themes of self-control, endurance, and movement toward a goal, this time </p>
<p>through the wilderness of Sinai rather than a footrace, and the implied prize </p>
<p>is the promised land rather than a wreath. Both metaphoric treks point to </p>
<p>receiving salvic reward at the culmination of the ages.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>e adjectival</p>
<p>“all” appears ve times in 10:1 –4 and highlights the people’s solidarity and </p>
<p>shared experiences of grace in the wilderness. is is oset by the adversa-</p>
<p>tive “but” in 10:5, which ensues with “the majority of them” being killed </p>
<p>in the wilderness; “some of them” appears four times in relation to four </p>
<p>vices that entail dierent punishments (10:7–10). is pattern evokes pa-</p>
<p>thos related to fear and helps emphasize the climactic warning in 10:12. </p>
<p>Comparison between the wilderness generation and Corinthians is stressed </p>
<p>by way of chiasm:</p>
<p>A. “Now these things as types . . . ” (10:6)</p>
<p>B. “Do not . . . as some of them . . . ” (10:7)</p>
<p>C. “Let us not . . . as some of them . . . ” (10:8)</p>
