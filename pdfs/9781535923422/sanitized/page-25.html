<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Paul’s transformation from a Pharisee and persecutor of Christ’s followers </p>
<p>took place only several years aer Christ’s crucixion.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Once established in</p>
<p>Antioch, he became an apostle to the Gentiles travelling to dierent cities </p>
<p>proclaiming the gospel of Christ. It was during his so-called second mission-</p>
<p>ary journey that he rst evangelized Corinth, according to Acts 18:1–20.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>his stay in Corinth corresponds with Gallio’s proconsulship of the region </p>
<p>as portrayed in Acts, he was there somewhere between the years of 50–52 </p>
<p>CE.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>A few years later he stayed in Ephesus and there wrote 1 Corinthians</p>
<p>(see 1 Cor 15:32; 16:8–9), having already sent them at least one previous </p>
<p>letter now lost to us (5:9). e rst canonical letter was written about 54 or </p>
<p>55 CE.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>We will address issues surrounding Paul and the Corinthians, and</p>
<p>the occasion and purpose for this letter, but rst some information about </p>
<p>ancient Corinth and its myths is in order.</p>
<p>Corinth: Its People and Myths</p>
<p>Corinth acquired the reputation of wealth and accessibility. It was situated </p>
<p>strategically near the Isthmus of the Peloponnesus and had ports at Cen-</p>
<p>chreae and Lechaeum along with the diolkos road that enabled ships prior </p>
<p>to Paul’s day to pass from the Aegean to Ionian Sea. Among other things, </p>
<p>the city was a center for commerce, high-quality bronze, and state-of-the-</p>
<p>art ships.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> e Corinthians demonstrated their military power when, to-</p>
<p>gether with Athenians and Spartans, they defended Greece against Persia </p>
<p>(5</p>
<p>th</p>
<p>c. BCE). As a prime mover of the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BCE),</p>

<p>8:3; 9:1–30; 11:23–30; 13:1—15:25; 22:2–21; 26:4–23; Hengel 1997; Murphy-O’Connor </p>
<p>1996:1–101. </p>
<p>2. Although Acts has its own agenda, Keener 2014:3.2681–83, recently shows that </p>
<p>its account of Paul in Corinth is generally reliable.</p>

<p>1998:57.</p>
