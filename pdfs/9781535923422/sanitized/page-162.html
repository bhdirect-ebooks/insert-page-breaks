<p>Fusing the Horizons: Ambiguity in Idol Foods en and Now</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>(8:7–13; 10:23–29) and prohibiting it as leading to idolatry in others </p>
<p>(10:1–22) are less abrasive. Regarding 10:1–22 we do not need to sug-</p>
<p>gest that a stronger opinionated Sosthenes wrote this section as co-author </p>
<p>in a later draft (1:1),</p>
<p>158</p>
<p>or that this section is a different letter fragment or</p>
<p>interpolation,</p>
<p>159</p>
<p>or that Paul is condemning idol foods only when eaten in</p>
<p>idol precincts,</p>
<p>160</p>
<p>or that he condemns all idol food consumption unless it</p>
<p>remains unknown.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p>Paul, recognizing the complexity of circumstances in</p>
<p>which believers might encounter idol foods, provides warnings (8:9; 10:12, </p>
<p>14, 21) and ethical precepts based on love and imitation (8:13; 9:22b; </p>
<p>10:24, 31–11:1) that will help Corinthians discern the right course of ac-</p>
<p>tion needed for their unique circumstances. The strong members’ consump-</p>
<p>tion of idol food, even if eating it knowingly, will not necessarily result in </p>
<p>idolatry or apostasy.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p>And yet the situation is dangerous enough that, in</p>
<p>practice, Paul’s imperatives rule out almost every opportunity for the strong </p>
<p>to eat such food knowingly, unless they do so incognito or only with other </p>
<p>strong believers in the privacy of their own homes.</p>
<p>Our apostle’s warnings and principles in relation to idol foods, though </p>
<p>largely unappreciated in modern western societies, are still relevant in other </p>
<p>parts of the world. Derek Newton, for example, presents similar problems </p>
<p>that exist among Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Indonesian (Torajanese) </p>
<p>churches, the members of which grapple with participation in religio-</p>
<p>indigenous shrine ceremonies, meals related to ancestor worship, and so </p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>163</p>
<p>As with Paul and the Corinthians, there is ambiguity on what exactly</p>
<p>constitutes idolatry in such practices, and boundaries must be negotiated </p>
<p>for determining what is permissible and what is not for these Christians. </p>
<p>Under such conditions, loving and honoring God, loving one’s neighbor, </p>
<p>and imitating Christ go a long way. Generally the issue of stronger believers </p>
<p>causing new or weak believers to fall away from faith is entirely relevant. </p>
<p>It is quite possible, for instance, that a new convert who struggles with </p>
<p>pornography will stumble over what a “stronger” believer permits himself or </p>

<p>used elsewhere by Paul: e.g., 12:1 (cf. 10:1); 1:9 (cf. 10:13); 6:18 (cf. 10:14); Rom 15:4 </p>
<p>(cf. 10:6, 11).</p>
