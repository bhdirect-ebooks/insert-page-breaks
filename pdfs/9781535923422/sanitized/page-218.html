<p>men do. They are just as competent as men, then, to lead a church, teach </p>
<p>in a classroom, or preach from the pulpit.</p>
<p>Paul’s rhetorical questions in 14:36—Or did the word of God originate </p>
<p>from you? Or were you the only ones it reached?—expect the answer “no.” </p>
<p>is rebuke targets members who might be arrogant about their spiritual </p>
<p>gis and decide to disregard Paul’s commands. He continues that if anyone </p>
<p>thinks themselves a prophet or spiritual, let that person know that the </p>
<p>matters about which I write to you are the command of the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p>Paul appeals to ethos that prompts his auditors to recognize his apostolic </p>
<p>authority.</p>
<p>283</p>
<p>He might be claiming that through inspired revelation he is</p>
<p>writing these imperatives, but more likely he has in mind Jesus’s command </p>
<p>to love one another as the basis for his instructions (8:1–3; 13:1–13). If any </p>
<p>prophet or spiritual person among them does not recognize the love com-</p>
<p>mand and Paul’s instruction related to it, that person is not recognized by </p>
<p>God, Christ, and the Spirit (14:38; cf. 8:3). is warning does not arise from </p>
<p>Paul on a power trip, but as iselton rightly asks, “If a prophet’s utterance </p>
<p>contradicts apostolic utterances (let alone biblical tradition), does not that </p>
<p>of itself disenfranchise the currency of the prophetic utterance?”</p>
<p>284</p>
<p>It seems</p>
<p>that any allegedly inspired word from prophetic congregants must be false </p>
<p>if their message contradicts what God, Christ, and the Spirit have already </p>
<p>spoken, whether through Scripture or apostolic teaching. As such, this per-</p>
<p>son is not recognized—his or her prophetic message does not come from </p>
<p>God’s Spirit. Moreover, these words may recall an oral tradition about false </p>
<p>prophets who speak in the name of the Lord but will be not be recognized </p>
<p>on judgment day; the Lord Jesus will say to them, “I never knew you” (Matt </p>
<p>7:21–23; cf. 10:33; 25:11–12).</p>
<p>e conclusion makes nal appeals to the brothers and sisters</p>
<p>regarding tongues, prophecy, and proper conduct in worship (14:39–40). </p>
<p>ey are to earnestly desire to prophecy, and do not hinder speaking </p>
<p>in tongues. In the rst clause Paul recapitulates the importance of seek-</p>
<p>ing intelligent spiritual discourse when assembling together (14:1, 26). In </p>
<p>the second clause he implies that even though prophecy is preferable to </p>
<p>tongues at these gatherings, tongues should not be forbidden so long as </p>
<p>they are interpreted in the way prescribed earlier (14:26–28). No doubt, </p>
<p>private praying in tongues also should not be hindered. Inclusive of the </p>
