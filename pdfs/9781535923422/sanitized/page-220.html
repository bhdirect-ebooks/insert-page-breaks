<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: </p>
<p>Fifth Supporting Proof (15:1–58)</p>
<p>Paul’s nal proof supporting solidarity discourages the view of “some” who </p>
<p>deny a future resurrection (see 15:12). e inclusive and repetitive “all” ral-</p>
<p>lies for unied beliefs (15:7, 22–23, 28, 51). Although he collects witnesses </p>
<p>supporting Christ’s resurrection, thus engaging with what is forensic, his </p>
<p>rhetorical aim is still deliberative.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> He tries to convince his auditors to ac-</p>
<p>cept bodily resurrection, and his use of “in vain” highlights what is disad-</p>
<p>vantageous for them (15:2, 14, 17; cf. 15:10, 32, 58).</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Paul presents evidence</p>
<p>from the past (15:1–11) and blends forensic and deliberative elements in hy-</p>
<p>pothetical arguments (15:12–19), all to persuade the Corinthians to accept </p>
<p>his point-of-view and live in a manner conducive to it (15:20–34, 58). Our </p>
<p>apostle rst presents traditional material distilling the heart of the gospel </p>
<p>message (5:1–11). Two leading questions in 15:12 and 15:35 help formulate </p>
<p>the subsequent structure, and their sections end with ethical imperatives.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>A. Leading statement and question followed by hypothetical arguments </p>
<p>showing disadvantages of the denial of resurrection (15:12–19)</p>
<p>B. Adam/Christ comparisons showing advantages of the resurrection </p>
<p>(15:20–22)</p>
<p>C. Christ’s return and defeat of death and other powers based on </p>
<p>Scripture (15:23–28)</p>
<p>D. Concluding exhortations with rhetorical questions showing </p>
<p>disadvantages of denying the resurrection (15:29–34)</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>. Leading questions followed by examples supporting the nature of </p>
<p>the resurrected body (15:35–44)</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>. Adam/Christ comparisons supporting the resurrected body </p>
<p>(15:45–49)</p>
