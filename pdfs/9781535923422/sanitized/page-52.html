<p>(1:18b, 21b). ey consider Christ to be both the power of God and the wis-</p>
<p>dom of God. ese designations do not appear to identify Christ as distinc-</p>
<p>tive attributes, emanations, or personications of God. Rather, as the context </p>
<p>suggests, “Christ” in 1:24 stands for the message of Jesus Christ being cruci-</p>
ed, and this message eectually works in the believers divine power to live
<p>a transformed life and receive disclosed wisdom. is perception of the cross </p>
<p>is expressed further with the ironic declaration that God’s folly and weakness </p>
<p>is wiser and stronger than human wisdom and strength (1:25; cf. 3:18). e </p>
<p>cross of Christ exposes as worthless and utterly mistaken the entire human </p>
<p>system of values, epitomized by Roman society, which considered crucix-</p>
<p>ion a “symbol and enactment of abject worthlessness.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In 1:26–29 the Corinthian auditors are to review their calling not </p>
merely in terms of divine initiative and invitation for them to respond fa-
<p>vorably to becoming God’s people through Paul’s preaching, but in terms of </p>
<p>their social status at conversion, a status they currently maintain (cf. 7:17–</p>
<p>24). Not many of them are wise according to the esh, not many powerful, </p>
<p>not many noble-born. Although “not many” does not mean “none,” most </p>
<p>did not belong to the upper classes of Roman Corinth.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>ey are what the</p>
<p>apostle describes as the foolish things of the world. e weak, ignoble, de-</p>
<p>spised nobodies according to the world’s perspective oen are the ones God </p>
<p>chooses; they accept the message of the cross in contrast to those of high so-</p>
<p>cial standing who oen reject it.</p>

<p>Among the church’s members are slaves,</p>
<p>widows, and poor (7:21–23, 39–40; 11:2–16, 22). is calling and election </p>
involves divine favor on the humble for the express purpose of shaming the
<p>wise and mighty along with prideful boasters (1:27, 29).</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>It is similar to the</p>
divine pattern one nds in early Jewish traditions (Deut 4:37–38; 7:6–7; Bar
<p>3:26–27; Jdt 9:11–14).</p>

<p> Conversely, Pliny the Elder captures Roman senti-</p>
<p>ment when writing about a funerary oration in which Metellus the senior </p>
<p>is praised for achieving ten of the greatest things for wise men to pursue. </p>
<p>Among the ten are to become a top warrior, supreme orator, enjoy highest </p>
<p>honor, possess complete wisdom, be a most distinguished senator, and ac-</p>
<p>quire a large fortune (Nat. 7.45). Similarly, Aristotle’s components of human </p>

<p>28. In 1:26 the tripartite use of the wise, powerful, and noble seem informed by Jer </p>
<p>9:22–23 (see 1:30 below).</p>
29. Hence, this election involves social status rather than individual predestination
<p>to nal salvation. e latter conicts with believers being in danger of apostasy (e.g., </p>
<p>3:16–17; 8:5–13; 10:1–12).</p>
