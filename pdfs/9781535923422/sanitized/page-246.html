<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>
<p>222</p>
<p>way, it might have provided him with the leverage necessary to interpret </p>
<p>God as a deliverer from death.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>Better still, his selection of Hosea is not</p>
<p>arbitrary but exemplies another example of his use of midrash known as </p>
<p>gezerah shavah (see 1 Cor 10:1–11). He links the hook word “death” from </p>
<p>Isaiah with Hosea’s text so that the concepts of the former are read into the </p>
<p>latter. With this hermeneutic intact, the futuristic time, deliverance, and </p>
<p>image of resurrection yet to be fullled from Isaiah’s text could be read by </p>
<p>Paul into Hosea’s words so as to evoke a taunt against death rather than </p>
<p>invite its mayhem, as Hosea’s context does.</p>
<p>Since death is the foreboding lot of all humans (Pliny Ep. 5.5; Philos-</p>
<p>tratus Vit. Soph. 1.17.504; Seneca, Lucil. 49:9–11; 66.42–43; 77.11–19), the </p>
<p>prospect of dying prompted philosophers to nd ways to assuage that fear, </p>
<p>as Seneca evinces: “Death follows old age precisely as old age follows youth. </p>
<p>He who does not wish to die cannot have wished to live. For life is granted </p>
<p>to us with the reservation that we shall die; to this end our path leads. ere-</p>
<p>fore, how foolish it is to fear it, since men simply await that which is sure, </p>
<p>but fear only that which is uncertain! Death has its xed rule—equitable </p>
<p>and unavoidable. Who can complain when he is governed by terms which </p>
<p>include everyone?” (Lucil. 30.10–11). Again he writes, “Do you regard as </p>
<p>more fortunate the ghter who is slain on the last day of the games than one </p>
<p>who goes to his death in the middle of the festivities? Do you believe that </p>
<p>anyone is so foolishly covetous of life that he would rather have his throat </p>
<p>cut in the dressing-room than in the amphitheatre? . . . Death visits each </p>
<p>and all; the slayer soon follows the slain . . . what does it matter for how </p>
<p>long a time you avoid that which you cannot escape?” (93:12).e prophetic </p>
<p>taunt that Paul interprets from Scripture inadvertently answers Seneca by </p>
<p>signaling the nal triumph over life’s most unbeatable foe. rough God </p>
<p>and the resurrection, death is utterly defeated. e rhetorical questions of </p>
<p>“where” death’s victory and goad are to be found prompt the auditors to </p>
<p>respond, “ey are nowhere to be found!”</p>
<p>e goad of death is sin is oen translated as the “sting of death,” but </p>
<p>κέντρον in this sentence does not connote the mere sting of an insect (unless </p>
<p>a scorpion is meant). More plausible here is the sharp point of a goad used </p>
<p>as an instrument of torture (Herodotus, His. 3.130) or representing enslave-</p>
<p>ment with a view to treating humans like beasts with goads and whips (Plato </p>
<p>Leg. 777A). It may be precisely this type of enslavement that prompts Paul’s </p>
<p>mention of sin not just with death via Adam but also in relation to the Law. </p>
<p>In other letters, enslavement is one way Paul describes being in bondage to </p>
<p>120. Perhaps he also found this interpretation reinforced by the restoration that takes </p>
<p>place in Hos 14:4–7 (cf. Keener 2005:134).</p>
