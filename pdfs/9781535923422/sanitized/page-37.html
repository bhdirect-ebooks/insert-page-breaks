<p>Introduction (1:1–9)</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>imperial society that dominates it.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>is confession happens in every place,</p>
<p>which may be alluding to a prophetic realization that the Lord God’s name </p>
<p>is worshipped by the Gentiles “in every place” (Mal 1:11).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>e Corinthians</p>
<p>are prompted to recognize a pan-Mediterranean horizon of Christ followers </p>
<p>extending beyond their local church to churches in every nation.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>eir</p>
<p>recognition of this may help deate arrogance and self-centered ideas that </p>
<p>they are not accountable to anyone (see 14:36).</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>e letter’s greeting is in the form of a benediction: grace and peace to </p>
<p>you. is formula is uniquely Christian and possibly originates with Paul.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He consistently uses it as an opening trademark in his letters (e.g., Rom 1:7; </p>
<p>Gal 1:3; Phil 1:2). It goes beyond the letter conventions of typical Jewish </p>
<p>and Hellenistic writers by invoking shalom and favor not only from the one </p>
<p>Creator, God the Father, but also from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving Period (1:4–9)</p>
<p>Aer writing the prescript our apostle expresses gratitude by stating, I thank </p>
<p>my God always for you. He typically includes a thanksgiving paragraph </p>
<p>aer his letter openings, though Galatians and 2 Corinthians are notable </p>
<p>exceptions, and both these letters happen to be his most confrontational.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul’s thanksgivings feature ve elements—the giving of thanks, mention of </p>
<p>the person thanked (God), an adverbial “always,” mention of the recipients, </p>
<p>and reason for giving thanks, which is then unpacked.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Paul is thankful that</p>
<p>the congregation members have been made rich in Christ, in all speech </p>
<p>and all knowledge. He possibly knew that the origin of the formulaic </p>
<p>phrase “speech and knowledge” arose from clashes between philosophers </p>
<p>and sophists.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>What Paul stresses here is that speech and knowledge is God</p>
<p>11. Cf. Horsley 1997:244–45.</p>
<p>12. Ciampa/Rosner 2010:57–58. Here again Paul interprets κύριος/YHWH as Jesus.</p>
<p>13. See further Hvalvik 2005:123–43.</p>
<p>14. Cf. Hays 1997:17.</p>
<p>15. See discussions in Doering 2012:407–15; Lieu 1985:168–69. I suggest that Paul </p>
<p>originally adopted “greetings and peace” from the style of certain Jewish-Hellenistic </p>
<p>letters (e.g., 2 Macc 1:1) but replaced “greetings” (χαίρειν) with “grace” (χάρις) since the </p>
<p>latter reected better the content of his messages.</p>
<p>16. Among disputed letters Titus also contains no introductory thanksgiving. In </p>
<p>papyri letters the sender’s thanks can be situational, motivated by good news of the </p>
<p>recipients’ welfare: cf. Arzt-Grabner 2010:149.</p>
<p>17. Fee 1987:36. We nd similar thanksgivings to deities in other ancient letters (P. </p>
<p>Mich. 8.473.29; 2 Macc 1:10–11), but their presence may be more the exception than </p>
<p>rule if Van Voorst 2010:163–65 is correct.</p>
<p>18. See Betz 1986: 33; cf. 30–32. e combination of these words is likewise found </p>
