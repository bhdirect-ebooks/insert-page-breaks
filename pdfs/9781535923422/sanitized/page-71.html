<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>consists of Corinthian believers, will be revealed for what it is truly worth </p>
<p>on the appointed day in which it will be tried by re. Our text resembles an </p>
<p>apocalyptic scene in which the day of the Lord brings about ery judgment </p>
<p>(Isa 66:15–19, 22, 24; Mal 3:2–3, 18–19; Zeph 1:18; 2 Bar. 48.39).</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>Oen</p>
<p>re is associated with the destruction of the wicked,</p>
<p>125</p>
<p> and perhaps Paul as-</p>
sumes the essence of divine presence ignites the ames (2 ess 1:8; cf. Heb
<p>12:27–29), but ultimately this re is symbolic of judgment, punishment, and </p>
<p>purication. e day when this will be revealed happens at Christ’s return </p>
<p>(1:8; 4:3–5; 5:5; Rom 2:16; cf. 2 Cor 5:10). </p>
<p>Paul’s narrative depicts a re that tests the materials (i.e., human per-</p>
<p>sons) of God’s temple. e workers whose materials survive the re receive </p>
<p>payment in the form of a reward; other workers are not rewarded since their </p>
<p>materials are burned up.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>e workers themselves, however, are saved</p>
<p>through the re. is scene is not about bad saints losing their eschatologi-</p>
<p>cal reward as opposed to losing their salvation.</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>A careful distinction must</p>
<p>be made between the workers and their work. If the materials represent </p>
<p>various persons who comprise the congregation, it is these people who are </p>
<p>destroyed by the re—they fail to persevere in Christ or are otherwise unt </p>
<p>for nal salvation on judgment day. e workers lose their disciples in the </p>
<p>re; their many hours of laboring to convert and nurture them turn out to </p>
<p>be a costly waste of time. e workers themselves, however, remain saved.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is loss imagines the realization of what Paul means when he fears that </p>
<p>his own work among his converts will turn out to be in vain if they commit </p>
<p>apostasy (Gal 4:11; 1 ess 2:1; 3:5; Phil 2:16).</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>e Corinthian believers</p>
<p>are susceptible to such judgment if they persist in discord, vices, and assimi-</p>
<p>lation to worldly ideologies.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>eir destruction would take away from the</p>
<p>124. Terms such as “temple,” “day,” burning, and associating the righteous with pre-</p>
<p>cious materials and wicked with ammable products, make Malachi a possible infor-</p>
<p>mant to Paul’s words. cf. Proctor 1993:11–13; Frayer-Griggs 2013b:523–24; Williams </p>
<p>2001:264–65, 269–72.</p>
<p>125. E.g., 1 En. 91.9–11; T. Zeb. 10.3; 4 Macc 12:12; Matt 3:12; Mark 9:48; 2 Pet 3:7.</p>
<p>126. In 3:15 ζημιόω can refer to punishment or suering loss. Given the reward in </p>
<p>3:14, the latter is preferred (Yinger 1999:218–19). </p>
<p>127. Contrast Oberholtzer 1988:326. See further, Oropeza 8/2016.</p>
<p>128. In this apocalyptic context, σῴζω does not merely mean escape, as though ee-</p>
ing from a burning house. e person is saved from divine wrath and nal condemna-
<p>tion (1:18; 5:5; 9:22; 15:2; 2 Cor 2:15; Rom 5:9).</p>
<p>129. On Paul’s concept “in vain,” see Oropeza 2009:148.</p>
<p>130. Philo similarly mentions Jews who assimilate and abandon their religious tra-</p>
<p>ditions to gain social prominence in foreign lands (Jos. 254); his nephew Tiberius Julius </p>
<p>Alexander exemplies such apostasy (Josephus Ant. 20.100).</p>
