<p>blended. If Zech 4:6–10 is being alluded to here, Paul’s renovated meaning </p>
<p>through this text is that the building up of the Corinthians as the temple </p>
<p>of God is accomplished not by human might nor by rhetorical power but </p>
<p>by God’s powerful Spirit.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>Hence, the Corinthians should not measure a</p>
<p>leader’s worth based on status or rhetorical skill but on the value of spiritual </p>
<p>preaching and power manifest through weakness.</p>

<p>Excursus: Paul’s rhEtoric against thE soPhist DElivEriEs</p>
<p>Scholars frequently notice an apparent tension with Paul’s use of rhetoric </p>
<p>to criticize Corinthian attraction to rhetoric. Among the various ways this </p>
<p>issue is addressed, it makes good sense to suggest that Paul rejects only </p>
<p>certain aspects of rhetoric.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>More particularly, he disdains rhetoric when</p>
<p>coupled with certain sociocultural values such as status seeking, and espe-</p>
<p>cially manifest in the form of a speaker’s delivery. Our apostle comes against </p>
<p>a type of rhetoric that characterizes the sophists in Plato’s Gorgias. Their </p>
<p>speeches stressed form, superﬁciality, and showmanship over philosophical </p>
<p>content. Paul, however, stresses spiritual knowledge about Christ as the </p>
<p>proper content of his messages (2 Cor 11:6; cf. 1 Cor 2). It will turn out that </p>
<p>certain Corinthians show contempt for the apostle’s speeches and physical </p>
<p>presence (2 Cor 10:10). This way of scrutinizing preachers already seems to </p>
<p>be a problem in 1 Cor 1–4, perhaps prominently by the faction loyal to Apol-</p>
<p>los (see 1:12), and that is why Paul promotes a different way of perceiving </p>
<p>wisdom and proclamation. </p>
<p>Doubtless the Corinthians learned how to criticize oratory performanc-</p>
<p>es by listening to many sophists and philosophers who preached publicly in </p>
<p>their city. This may have conditioned them to place too much value on the </p>
<p>actual appearance and performance of orators, known in rhetorical hand-</p>
<p>books as delivery (one of the ﬁve components of rhetoric).</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>In Lives of the</p>
<p>Ten Orators, when asked what is most important in rhetoric, Demosthenes </p>
<p>responded, “delivery.” When asked the second and third most important </p>
<p>things, he replied, “delivery,” and again, “delivery” (Ps.-Plutarch, Vit. </p>
