<p>and he would now be subject to death and decay (Gen 3:17–19).</p>
<p>83</p>
<p> e gar-</p>
<p>ments of “skins” that God made for Adam and Eve (Gen 3:21), though </p>
<p>sometimes understood as animal skins, is sometimes interpreted as the </p>
<p>original couple being clothed with mortal human esh (Gen. Rab. 20:12; </p>
<p>Job 10:11; cf. Ezek 37:6–8).</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>An idea similar to this may be presupposed by</p>
<p>Paul’s use of nudity that analogously compares a bare kernel with both the </p>
<p>mortality and the external esh of the human body. is same body will be </p>
transformed into an immortal one clothed with divine glory through the
<p>resurrection (15:49, 53–54). </p>
<p>For Paul it would seem that regardless of whether dead bodies are re-</p>
<p>duced to particles, ashes, or bones, they are given new life and transformed </p>
to possess and reect divine glory. God, who created all things, is powerful
<p>enough to rework and restore bodies from whatever materials or lack of </p>
<p>them remain. Even so, the seed sown in the ground looks very dierent than </p>
<p>what grows from it, and so it is possible to surmise that this analogy suggests </p>
<p>that the raised body will be dierent than the buried one. Perhaps more ac-</p>
<p>curately, though, both continuity and discontinuity are meant contextually.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e perishable body of Jesus sown in burial was recognizable as the same </p>
<p>person in the resurrected state, even though he was now gloried. As the </p>
<p>rstfruit, so will be the harvest regarding the nature of resurrection. </p>
<p>Further analogies that reect the resurrected body include Paul’s men-</p>
<p>tion of dierent types of animal and celestial bodies, both of which probably </p>
<p>allude to their creation in Gen 1–3. e celestial/heavenly bodies refer to </p>
<p>the stars and other lights in the sky, though it is not impossible that they </p>
<p>might be interpreted by some to include angels from heaven.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p> Both heav-</p>
<p>enly and earthly bodies possess glory, suggesting the goodness of creation, </p>
<p>and despite Adam’s sin and subsequent death, some residual glory is main-</p>
<p>tained among humans and creatures.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>All have variegating degrees of glory</p>
<p>(i.e., beauty and radiance) endowed to them by the good pleasure of their </p>
<p>Creator. In 15:42, in this manner also assumes and takes up the content of </p>
<p>15:36b–41 in a fourfold manner astutely described by iselton: “(a) the </p>
<p>discontinuity between the old body which is ‘sown’ (v. 37) and the new body </p>
<p>which is raised (v. 42); (b) the sovereign power of God to enact far-reaching </p>
<p>83. Dierently, philosophical schools might interpret nudity as the soul persisting </p>
<p>aer death stripped of the body: Plato Gorgias 523A–524A; Philo Virt. 76.</p>

<p>86. Meyer 1887:2.87, argues for angels as the heavenly bodies, marshalling Gospel </p>
<p>traditions that connect resurrection with being like the angels (Matt 22:30; Mark 12:25; </p>
<p>Luke 20:36).</p>
