<p>whether bound up or let down, but an actual veil or head covering perhaps </p>
<p>made of textile.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>In Paul’s world hair oen conveys sexuality, fertility, and</p>
<p>may even symbolize the female’s genitals. Tertullian’s On the Veiling of Vir-</p>
<p>gins would later indicate that as the woman’s “lower parts are not made bare </p>
<p>have her upper likewise covered” (Virg. 1.12).</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Without headgear she risks</p>
<p>self-advertisement conveying sexual attraction, availability, immodesty, and </p>
<p>sexual unfaithfulness (Philo Spec. 3.51–56; Apuleius Met. 2.8; Num 5:11–</p>
31). She also diverts congregation members’ attention away from God. Her
<p>covering honors her delity to her husband in contrast to uncovered hair </p>
<p>that dishonors him, God, gender distinction, and connects her to what is </p>
<p>disreputable. What would encourage women in the congregation to discard </p>
<p>their coverings? One possibility is that they confused private and public </p>
<p>spaces when worshipping together. Paul’s churches normally met in houses </p>
<p>rather than temples, sanctuaries, or synagogues (16:19; Rom 16:5; Phlm 2; </p>
<p>Col 4:15; Acts 5:42; 12:2).</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Whereas respectable wives and women might</p>
<p>normally cover themselves in public settings, they did not do so when in </p>
<p>the privacy of their own homes. Hence, since worship gatherings were con-</p>
<p>ducted in homes, they may have thought it unnecessary to wear headgear, </p>
<p>especially if it was their own home.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>ey interpreted church meetings as</p>
<p>private rather than public spaces, and among a family of believing “brothers </p>
<p>and sisters” in which Paul’s motto “nor male and female” (Gal 3:28) was </p>
<p>embraced, they confused gender equality in Christ with sameness and felt </p>
<p>no need to be covered.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>is would warrant why Paul, discerning that their</p>
<p>uncovered heads distracted men in the congregation as well as sent the </p>
<p>wrong symbolic messages to outsiders who visited their gatherings, stresses </p>
<p>the importance of gender distinction related to head coverings.</p>
<p>Paul’s graphic resolve is for the woman who does not cover her hair to </p>
<p>have it cut o or her head shaved (11:6). e assumption might be that if </p>
<p>her hair were short and uncovered, men in the congregation at least would </p>

<p>24. Such homes become “sanctuary space” rather than household space (Cameron/</p>
<p>Miller 2011:277). is does not preclude, however, their meeting in other places also </p>
<p>(see 11:17–34).</p>
<p>25. See Massey 2013:39–56.</p>
<p>26. On sameness, see iselton 2000:829. Another possibility is that Corinthian </p>
<p>women were encouraged to adopt the “new” type of Roman woman who was more </p>
<p>promiscuous and provocatively dressed than her predecessors (Winter 2003). A third </p>
<p>opinion is that certain women converts used to participate in mystery cults (e.g., </p>
<p>Dionysian) and brought that worship style into the church, inclusive of unbound and </p>
<p>disheveled hair when prophesying (Kroeger 2002:659–60; Kroeger/Kroeger 1978:331–</p>
<p>38; Schüssler Fiorenza 1983:228). A combination of these is also possible. </p>
