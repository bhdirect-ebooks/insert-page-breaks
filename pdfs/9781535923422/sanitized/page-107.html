<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>83</p>
<p>e way Paul argues suggests the Corinthians are not convinced they are </p>
<p>doing anything wrong. ey already heard Paul’s warnings about sexual </p>
<p>misconduct in a previous letter (5:9), and yet they continue in fornication. </p>
<p>Paul must rst dismantle their ideology through Scripture and reason be-</p>
<p>fore giving them new commands in 6:18–20 encouraging bodily purity. </p>
<p>Paul may have derived the interlocutor’s justication, all things are </p>
<p>permissible for me, either from a popular maxim or the congregation’s own </p>
<p>slogan, possibly in response to Paul’s previous letter (6:12a, c).</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>Both views</p>
<p>are not incompatible if we assume the congregants adopted the saying as </p>
<p>their own from what was “in the air” at the time. Elitists are described by </p>
<p>Dio Chrysostom as those to whom “all things are permitted” but needing </p>
<p>self-control (Or. 62.3; cf. 3.10).</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>He relates the notion of permissibility to</p>
<p>kings and wise persons (Or. 14.13–17), an idea aligned with Stoics who con-</p>
<p>sider the wise as lords over their circumstances and free to do as they please </p>
<p>(Plutarch Stoic. abs. 1058B –C; Epictetus Diatr. 2.1.23; Diogenes Laertius </p>
<p>Vit. phil. 7.121).</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>rough this saying the Corinthian interlocutor works</p>
<p>with philosophical wisdom to claim it is permissible to indulge in sexual </p>
<p>urges; to relieve these impulses is as natural as satisfying one’s appetite: </p>
<p>foods are for the belly, and belly is for foods (6:13a). e belly (κοιλία) </p>
<p>suggests the entire cavity of the body inclusive of the stomach and organs </p>
<p>such as intestines and womb.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>e word sometimes refers to sexual organs,</p>
<p>which move beyond mere appetites of the stomach (2Sam [2Kgdms] 7:12; </p>
<p>16:11; Ps 132[131]:11).</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> Indulgence of both food and sexual activities char-</p>
<p>acterize certain dinner symposiums, as noted earlier. e interlocutor adds, </p>
<p>however, that God will do away with both one and the other (6:13b). is </p>
<p>assumes that indulgent behavior is morally irrelevant.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>e Corinthian</p>
<p>claim may be paraphrased as follows: “We should gratify our appetites for </p>
<p>food and sex; that’s what the center of our bodies is designed to do. God will </p>
<p>eventually get rid of these things when we die anyway, so let’s enjoy them </p>
<p>while we still can!” (cf. 15:32).</p>
<p>Paul uses his own wisdom to respond. First, what they consider per-</p>
<p>missible may not be benecial for them (6:12b). What is permitted should </p>
<p>be conducive to what is righteous, virtuous, and advantageous for the </p>
<p>88. For the maxim view, see Garland 2003:226–231; for the slogan, Murphy-</p>
