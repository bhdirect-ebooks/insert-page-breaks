<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>
<p>220</p>
<p>even though transformed—Paul imagines a change of apparel (ἀλλάσσω),</p>
<p>111</p>
<p> </p>
<p>which is virtually synonymous with the “putting on” (ἐνδύω) of the im-</p>
<p>perishable, immortal covering (15:53). e self under the garment, though </p>
<p>fully sanctied, remains the same.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>e body’s transformation will be instantaneous rather than a long pro-</p>
<p>cess: in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. ese </p>
<p>words resemble 1 ess 4:15–18, but there is no mention of a catching away </p>
<p>and gathering in the air to meet the Lord. Paul is more interested in describ-</p>
<p>ing the nature of bodily transformation here. e nal trumpet imagines </p>
<p>Israel’s feasts again as in 15:20–23. is time the Feast of Trumpet Blasts </p>
<p>seems foregrounded. On the rst day of the seventh month it signaled that a </p>
<p>holy gathering was to take place and the people were to rest from their labors </p>
<p>(Lev 23:23–25). Another blast signaled the Day of Atonement ten days later, </p>
<p>and work was to cease. is same blast marked the year of Jubilee or “ram’s </p>
<p>horn” every y years (Lev 25:9–13; cf. 23:27–32). In that year, as Christopher </p>
<p>Wright arms, “there was a proclamation of liberty to Israelites who had be-</p>
<p>come enslaved for debt, and a restoration of land to families who had been </p>
<p>compelled to sell it out of economic need in the previous y years. . . . It was </p>
<p>these two components of the jubilee, freedom and restoration, that entered </p>
<p>into the metaphoric and eschatological use of the jubilee in prophetic and </p>
<p>later NT thought.”</p>
<p>113</p>
<p> e convocation seems to have inuenced later apoca-</p>
<p>lyptic traditions in which a trumpet blast marked the nal Jubilee and gather-</p>
<p>ing of God’s exilic people throughout the world to enter into a nal time of </p>
<p>rest (Isa 27:13; Pss. Sol. 11.1–9; Matt 24:31<span class="wsf9">). Pa<span class="_ _0" />ul appa<span class="_ _0" />ren<span class="_ _0" />tly developed these<span class="_ _1" /> </span></p>
<p>connections from Leviticus and Isa 25–27, and interpreted such an event in </p>
<p>light of Christ’s second coming in which Gentiles would be gathered with </p>
<p>God’s people to celebrate ultimate deliverance, similar to that which Jubilee </p>
<p>describes but inclusive of death’s defeat.</p>
<p>e outcome of this transformation is derived from Isa 25:8: then will </p>
<p>happen the word that is written: “Death was swallowed up into victory.” </p>
<p>Paul’s quote follows the Hebrew text closer than Septuagint. e former has </p>
<p>God as the subject who swallows up death “forever” (חצנל), whereas the </p>
<p>latter in better manuscripts has death as the empowered subject that swal-</p>
<p>lows up nations and people, which then contrasts the Lord God who takes </p>
<p>away every tear from every face. Neither version includes the words, “in </p>
<p>victory” (εἰς νῖκος), which may suggest that Paul follows a tradition similar </p>
<p>111. E.g., Gen 35:2; Appian Bell. Civ. 5.122§504.</p>
<p>112. With Ware 2013b:487, we notice that the subject of the perishable and imper-</p>
<p>ishable body remains the same in 15:53–54.</p>
