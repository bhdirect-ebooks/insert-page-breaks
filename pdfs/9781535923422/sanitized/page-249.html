<p>Closing Matters (1 Cor 16:1–24)</p>
<p>225</p>
<p>(1:2); here he means the poor among Christ’s followers in Jerusalem (Rom </p>
<p>15:25–27, 31; cf. 2 Cor 8:4, 13–15; 9:1, 12; Acts 24:7). </p>
<p>Some possibilities for their poverty include a famine that struck Pales-</p>
<p>tine, the result of being persecuted, or a long-term outcome of church mem-</p>
<p>bers attempting to share all material goods (Acts 4:32–37; 8:1; 11:28–30; </p>
<p>12:1). e term for the collection, λογεία, relates to various types of busi-</p>
<p>ness transactions and sometimes religious collections such as for a temple </p>
<p>or god.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Paul uses this term for a voluntary contribution which seems to</p>
<p>have religious and prophetic signicance from his perspective. No doubt </p>
<p>he hoped that this blessing might mend a developing ri between Judean </p>
<p>Christ-followers devoted to Mosaic Law and Gentile converts of his cir-</p>
<p>cumcision-free gospel.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>He may have likewise believed this act would fulll</p>
<p>prophecies about Gentiles bringing their wealth to Zion (Isa 42:6; 49:6; </p>
<p>60:1–19).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Some other motivations behind this collection may include</p>
<p>Paul’s adherence to the Jerusalem apostles’ request for him to remember the </p>
<p>poor (Gal 2:10) and his commitment to love others (Gal 5:14; Jas 2:1–17; 1 </p>
<p>John 3:11–18). His imperative for the Corinthians to do what the Galatian </p>
<p>churches currently do centers not on mandatory giving but instruction on </p>
<p>how they are to contribute—by setting aside money every week. He repeat-</p>
<p>edly identies the collection as an act of grace (2 Cor 8:1, 4, 6–7; 9:14), and </p>
<p>even aer they delayed this collection for a year, he stresses that their giving </p>
<p>be done without compulsion (2 Cor 9:6–7; cf. 8:10). </p>
<p>Churches in Galatia, Macedonia, and Achaia assist in this giving; </p>
<p>Corinth belongs to the latter’s region (16:1; 2 Cor 8:1–5; 9:2; Rom 15:26). </p>
<p>is collection perhaps marks the earliest unied international cause among </p>
<p>many churches under the banner of charity. Paul instructs the congregation </p>
<p>how to proceed: on the rst day of the week, let each one of you set aside </p>
<p>something, storing it up as he or she may prosper. ese words suggest that </p>
<p>either each person is to save money at home at the beginning of each week, </p>
<p>or at that time bring this money to the congregation’s designated person for </p>
<p>storage.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>If the former, then no evidence suggests the rst of each week was</p>
<p>“pay day” for the Corinthians and thus assigned by Paul for that reason.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the latter, then the rst of the Sabbath week (μίαν σαββάτου) suggests </p>
<p>Sunday as a prominent day for church gatherings, doubtless because Jesus </p>
