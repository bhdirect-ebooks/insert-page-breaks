<p>With D as the centerpiece, the last enemy abolished is death. is struc-</p>
<p>tural form emphasizes a connection between the end and victory over the </p>
<p>ultimate enemy of death. Among the many beliefs about the aerlife in </p>
<p>Paul’s world, it was normally believed that death could not be reversed.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> </p>
<p>rough reliance on the power of God via Christ’s resurrection, however, </p>
<p>it will nally be defeated. e perpetual curse of the Adamic creation will </p>
<p>come to an end as the new creation in Christ is fully realized. </p>
e divine necessity of having Christ reign and God placing all en-
<p>emies under Christ’s feet nds it ground through a conceptual blend of Ps </p>
<p>8:6–7 and 110[109]:1.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>e blend is a familiar one for emergent Christians</p>
<p>(Eph 1:20–22; 1 Pet 3:21–22; Heb 2:5–8), which may suggest that Paul did </p>
<p>not originate the link but received it in a xed form.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>In the former psalm,</p>
<p>early disciples seem to identify Christ as the “son of man” when interpret-</p>
<p>ing “you [God] put all things under his [son of man’s] feet” (Ps 8:4; cf. Dan </p>
<p>7:9–14).</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> Perhaps this term also informs Paul that Christ is the eschato-</p>
<p>logical representative of humans and thus the last Adam (15:21–22, 45). e </p>
<p>word “feet” from Ps 8:6 was then linked with 110[109]:1 to interpret that if </p>
<p>all things are under the son of man’s feet, then so are his enemies: “e Lord </p>
<p>[God] said to my Lord [Christ, the Son of Man], ‘Sit on my right hand until </p>
<p>I make your enemies the footstool of your feet’” (cf. Mark 12:35–37). God </p>
<p>grants Christ authority to defeat all powers opposed to his name and judge </p>
<p>among the nations (Ps 110[109]:2–3, 5–6). </p>
<p>When God has sovereignly placed everything under Christ, death </p>
<p>included, Christ will then deliver the entire dominion of this world to his </p>
<p>Father, and the Son will be subjected to the one (God the Father) who put </p>
<p>in subjection everything to him (the Son). is notion is consistent with </p>
<p>what Paul writes elsewhere about the future standing of God and his kingly </p>
<p>representative—every knee shall bow and every tongue will confess Jesus as </p>
<p>54. E.g., Herodotus Hist. 3.62.3–5; Plato Cratylus 403B; Pindar Pyth. 3.1–60; Ae-</p>
<p>schylus Eum. 647–48; Sophocles Elect., 137–39; Pliny the Elder Nat. 7.55.190; Virgil </p>
<p>Georg. 4.453–525; Ovid Met. 10.1–11.84.</p>
<p>55. e linking of catchwords between these psalms provides another example of </p>
<p>gezerah shavah (cf. 10:1–11).</p>
<p>56. Cf. Boer 1988:117–18. Paul does not identify Jesus as “son of man” elsewhere.</p>
<p>57. ey probably knew this from oral memories of Jesus’s self-designation.</p>
