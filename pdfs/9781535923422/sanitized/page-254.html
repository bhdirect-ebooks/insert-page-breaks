<p>Closing Matters (1 Cor 16:1–24)</p>
<p>230</p>
<p>upon their arrival in Corinth, the congregants there will be relieved to </p>
<p>know that these members returned to them safely and brought joy and </p>
<p>comfort to the apostle.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>e Corinthians are to acknowledge such persons</p>
<p>as these. is imperative (ἐπιγινώσκετε) relates to honoring, respecting, </p>
<p>or recognizing the merit of the persons to whom it is attributed.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>We also</p>
<p>have here an early glimpse of leadership being raised up among a congrega-</p>
<p>tion’s own members.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>In conventional fashion Paul sends nal greetings from other brothers </p>
<p>and sisters (16:19–20). e churches in Asia Minor that greet them include </p>
<p>Ephesus and perhaps Troas, Miletus, Colossae, Hierapolis, and Laodicea (2 </p>
<p>Cor 2:12; Col 1:2; 4:13, 15–16; Acts 16:8; 20:5, 15–38).</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>Aquila and Prisca</p>
<p>also greet them along with the church that is in their house. Some ancient </p>
<p>manuscripts use the diminutive Priscilla (“little Prisca”), as in Acts 18:2, </p>
<p>18, 26, but this form may have developed from later scribes attempting to </p>
<p>harmonize it with the more original “Prisca.”</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> Prisca is the more respect-</p>
<p>ful name (Rom 16:3–5; 2 Tim 4:19).</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>According to Acts 18, she and her</p>
<p>husband Aquila had been banished from Rome by the edict of Emperor </p>
<p>Claudius because they were Jews (see Introduction). As tentmakers, they </p>
<p>probably owned a small shop in Corinth when they met Paul who then </p>
<p>lodged and worked in their shop. ey seem to have some nancial means </p>
<p>despite their modest trade; later they apparently return to another house </p>
<p>of theirs in Rome (Rom 16:3–5). Paul either relays their greetings from </p>
<p>Rome, or they also have a house in Ephesus (cf. Acts 18:24–26). To avoid </p>
<p>complaints that he omits anyone else wanting to send them greetings, Paul </p>
<p>includes the brothers and sisters all greet you.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> Another closing conven-</p>
<p>tion is the charge to greet one another with a holy kiss (cf. 1 ess 5:26; </p>
<p>Rom 16:16; 1 Pet 5:14; Justin Apol. 1.65.2). Its holy quality removes this kiss </p>
<p>from the realm of sensuality into the space of spiritual family members who </p>
<p>welcome one another with it as a sign of godly aection. Whether at this </p>
<p>is makes us question whether some would have entrusted Stephanas’s team with </p>
<p>their own letter. In any case, Chloe’s group seems involved in the earlier task (see 1:11).</p>
<p>34. See Barrett 1968:395. Alternatively, Fitzmyer 2008:626, suggests that these three </p>
<p>were already a source of comfort to the Corinthians prior to their sending them. </p>
<p>35. See 1 ess 5:12, though this verse uses οἶδα.</p>
<p>36. Cf. Hiigel 2003:110–11.</p>
<p>37. Schnabel 2006:1027.</p>
<p>38. See e.g., C, D, TR, vg.</p>
<p>39. See possible implications related to these traditions’ perception of women in </p>
<p>Kurek-Chomycz 2006:107–28.</p>
