<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>in fact lacks preeminence in the list of 12:8–10, is only one of a number </p>
<p>of “greater gis” at best (12:31a), and interpreted tongues has virtually the </p>
<p>same benet (14:5).</p>
<p>190</p>
<p> Paul encourages prophecy because it edies congre-</p>
<p>gation members, whereas speaking in tongues, if uninterpreted, does not. </p>
<p>Our apostle instructs them thusly to curb the tide of their apparent obses-</p>
<p>sion with tongues. He explains that the one who speaks in a tongue . . . </p>
<p>speaks mysteries in spirit. is phenomenon involves the believer’s human </p>
<p>spirit being connected to, drenched with, and empowered by the Holy Spirit </p>
<p>to speak thusly. e Spirit is the giver of the gi (12:7–11) and also plays </p>
<p>an intercessory role in prayer (Rom 8:26–27). is person utters mysteries </p>
<p>in that what is spoken is unintelligible to both the speaker and hearers—</p>
<p>this person speaks not to humans but God, for no one understands the </p>
<p>language (14:2; cf. 14:14).</p>
<p>191</p>
<p>e utterance is directed to God and is thus a</p>
<p>prayer or praise, and it also edies the self not because the speaker under-</p>
<p>stands the language spoken, but because the speaker’s spirit communes with </p>
<p>God’s Spirit (14:4, 14–15; cf. Jude 20). </p>
<p>Although Paul’s earlier references may be inclusive of human foreign </p>
<p>languages as one species of tongues (12:10; 13:1a), this variation does not t </p>
<p>his description in 14:2 since neither he nor anyone else seems to recognize </p>
<p>the language. It is remotely possible that he means, generally speaking, no </p>
<p>one understands it, but this possibility becomes even more remote when </p>
<p>we read that Paul assumes the Corinthians would not understand him if </p>
<p>he came speaking in tongues to them (14:6). If he were speaking a human </p>
<p>foreign language, it is very likely that someone in a multilingual center like </p>
<p>Corinth would understand him and be able to translate.</p>
<p>192</p>
<p>At least one study</p>
<p>that records and examines contemporary tongues considers it a unique dia-</p>
<p>lect or “pseudo-language” without denite linguistic structure.</p>
<p>193</p>
<p>Along this</p>
<p>line it can be said that the Spirit does not need a real language to prompt </p>
<p>sounds and utterances through humans.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p>But we simply do not know that</p>
<p>contemporary glossolalia has the same structure as Corinthian glossolalia, </p>
<p>nor yet that all contemporary glossolalia uniformly ts the description </p>
<p>190. Also, ἵνα (“that”) in 14:1, 5, is not understood in the nal sense of “in order </p>
<p>that,” but as a marker for an object clause in which the ἵνα-construct functions as a sub-</p>
<p>stitute for an innitive (see 4:2; 14:12; BDAG 476). Hence, tongues and other spiritual </p>
<p>things are not for the purpose of prophesying.</p>
<p>191. In 14:2 ἀκούω does not mean to “hear”—others do hear the tongues (e.g., 14:9, </p>
<p>16, 23, 27–28); it means to “understand” (cf. Mark 4:33; BDAG 38). See options for </p>
