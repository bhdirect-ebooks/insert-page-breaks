<p>Order and Solidarity When Assembling Together: </p>
<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>e fourth proof related to Paul’s appeal for solidarity focuses on the Cor-</p>
<p>inthians coming together as a church (11:17, 34; 14:26). His deliberative </p>
<p>discourse attempts to persuade congregation members to conduct them-</p>
<p>selves in an orderly manner for worship as the unied body of Christ. Aer </p>
<p>addressing gender distinction related to head coverings (11:2–16) and pro-</p>
<p>tocols related to their practice of the Lord’s Supper (11:17–34), the apostle </p>
<p>discusses spiritual gis: </p>
<p>A Spiritual Gis and Solidarity in the Body of Christ (1 Cor 12)</p>
<p>B Love as Better than Spiritual Gis (13) </p>
<p>A</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> Spiritual Gis of Prophecy and Tongues (14)</p>
<p>e center of this pattern suggests the Corinthians must operate with love as </p>
<p>their primary ethic when assembling together. Use of spiritual gis should </p>
<p>be for edifying others rather than distracting or confusing their solidarity </p>
<p>in worship. </p>
<p>Gender Distinction When Praying and Prophesying </p>
<p>(11:2–16)</p>
<p>Paul seems to structure this passage in the form of a chiasm:</p>
<p>A. Instruction based on church traditions and teachings (11:2–3)</p>
<p>B. Male and female distinction related to coverings and reecting </p>
<p>honor/shame (11:4–6)</p>
<p>C. Male and female distinction based on the original creation </p>
<p>(11:7–9)</p>
<p>D. Women’s authority over their heads (11:10)</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>. Male and female distinction based on original and new cre-</p>
<p>ation (11:11–12)</p>
