<p>Closing Matters (1 Cor 16:1–24)</p>

<p>route.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>It seems that Stephanas’s group may be arriving earlier by ship to</p>
<p>Corinth with this letter (16:15–18). Even though the Corinthians appar-</p>
<p>ently know Timothy already (Acts 18:5), Paul commends him in the style of </p>
<p>a letter of recommendation—he discloses the name of the one commended </p>
<p>and his relationship with that person. Timothy is Paul’s coworker whose </p>
<p>qualications include being faithful in services pertaining to the Lord, and </p>
<p>his assignment is to train up the Corinthians in all of Paul’s ways (16:10–11; </p>
<p>cf. 4:17).</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Given the competitive way the Corinthians compare leaders and</p>
<p>evaluate speaking performances, Paul, with good reason, has apprehension </p>
<p>about how they might scrutinize and intimidate Timothy. Unless he strongly </p>
<p>urges them to treat his protégé well, Timothy might not gain their approval.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He sternly charges them to let no one despise Timothy, but send him in </p>
<p>peace so that he may come to me. He expects the congregation to return </p>
<p>Timothy safely, “facilitated by the practical support of necessary provisions </p>
<p>and other practical needs.”</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>To assure his safe travel, Timothy should be</p>
<p>accompanied by whichever brothers and sisters the church might want to </p>
<p>send Paul at that time. </p>
<p>e Corinthians make a request (or inquiry) that Apollos should visit </p>
<p>them again (16:12).</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Some who consider Apollos their leader probably</p>
<p>made this request, and Paul responds that he strongly urged Apollos that </p>
<p>he might come to them along with those bringing this letter, but he was </p>
<p>quite unwilling to come at this time. ese words seem to betray Apollos’s </p>
reluctance to visit them on hearing about their divisions over allegiances
<p>to him (cf. 1:12). He probably thinks that in their current condition a visit </p>
<p>might be counterproductive.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Paul’s urge to Apollos reects that he does</p>
<p>not think Apollos had instigated this faction, and none should infer from </p>
<p>these words that there existed tensions between the two missionaries.</p>

<p>1999:595, 602.</p>
<p>19. is might especially be the case if later characterizations of Timothy being </p>
<p>despised as a youth has merit (1 Tim 4:12). Timothy’s alleged timidity, however, which </p>
<p>some interpret from 2 Tim 1:7 and 2:1–3, is more ction than fact according to Hutson </p>
<p>1997:58–73.</p>
<p>20. iselton 2000:1331.</p>
<p>21. Alternatively, Garland 2003:761, thinks that Paul anticipates their displeasure </p>
<p>when hoping for and not nding Apollos among those presently being sent. He thus </p>
<p>attempts to defuse any suspicions they might have that he prevented Apollos from re-</p>
<p>turning to them. </p>
<p>22. Wol 1996:433–34 and iselton 2000:1332, notice that Paul mentions no </p>
<p>greeting to the Corinthians from Apollos, when one might be expedient in 16:19.</p>
<p>23. Rightly, Mihaila 2009:191–93.</p>
