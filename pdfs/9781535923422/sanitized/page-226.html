<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>
<p>202</p>
<p>(Num 12:12; see 1 Cor 13:12; 14:34). In the story, Aaron asks Moses to heal </p>
<p>Miriam, as he pleads, “let her not be the same as though dead, as though </p>
<p>an untimely born (ἔκτρωμα).” Likewise, the image of a small and unt but </p>
<p>living miscarriage seems proper to his claim as the least of the apostles who </p>
<p>is not t to be called an apostle. Paul, a persecutor of the church, spiritually </p>
<p>dead and unt to become a follower of Christ, astonishingly becomes an </p>
apostle for Christ! Such transformation he could only attribute to divine fa-
<p>vor—by the grace of God I am what I am. And grace still works abundantly </p>
<p>through his missionary eorts and lowly tent-making trade: I labored more </p>
<p>than all of the other apostles. is is not self-boasting but recognition that </p>
divine grace takes eect in his meager human eorts.
<p>28</p>
<p>His many toils and</p>
<p>hardships is a boast in weakness that exercises God’s power (2:1–5; 2 Cor </p>
<p>11:22–33; 12:9–10). e grace of God, through his proclamations, results in </p>
<p>the Corinthians believing his gospel, though his words, whether I or they, </p>
<p>recognize that some were converted by other apostles and missionaries.</p>
<p>Disadvantages of Denying the Resurrection and </p>
<p>the Resurrection Forecast (15:12–28)</p>
<p>e leading question of this section arises from the previous proofs for </p>
<p>Christ’s bodily resurrection and conveys astonishment and reproach.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now if it is proclaimed that Christ has been risen from the dead, how </p>
<p>say some among you that there is no resurrection from the dead? Paul </p>
<p>arouses pathos; the recipients are stirred to feel ashamed about this denial. </p>
<p>Most scholars agree that they did not reject Christ’s resurrection but their </p>
<p>own. Beyond this, there is little agreement on the reason for their unbelief. </p>
<p>Since the congregation has an acute problem with factions, we nd it pe-</p>
<p>culiar that most interpreters argue for a unied reason for these members’ </p>
<p>denial.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>In all probability they denied the resurrection for dierent reasons,</p>
<p>and this reects the various competing beliefs about the aerlife in Greco-</p>
<p>Roman culture of that time.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>All the same, since Paul has stressed Christ’s</p>
<p>resurrection as bodily, this probably implies that Corinthian dissenters deny </p>
<p>the importance of their own bodies rising again (see 6:13–14; 15:35). </p>
