<p>ird Supporting Proof (8:1—11:1)</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>from Egypt and despising manna (Num 11:4–9, 34).</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>e Corinthians are</p>
<p>thus implicitly warned not to crave idol foods, which is conrmed by Paul’s </p>
<p>following exhortation that they should not become idolaters as some of </p>
<p>them (the wilderness generation) did. He cites Exod 32:6 regarding their </p>
<p>cultic festivities related to worshipping the golden calf: e people sat </p>
<p>down to eat and drink and rose up to play. is mimics activities related to </p>
<p>the establishment of their covenant with God, as Jerry Hwang arms: “e </p>
<p>God who provided Israel with food and drink in the wilderness, and with </p>
<p>whom the leaders were just worshiping and dining in Exodus 24, has now </p>
<p>been rejected using these very same ritual actions.”</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>Israel’s consumption</p>
<p>while sitting down before the golden calf doubtless implicates the Corinthi-</p>
<p>ans reclining in an idol’s temple to eat food (8:10), and suggests they, too, </p>
<p>are in danger of committing idolatry and apostasy. e notion of “play” sug-</p>
<p>gests sexual behavior and cultic dancing (Gen 26:8; Judg 21:21; Philo Mos. </p>
<p>1.302; 2.162), which builds a sturdy bridge to the next exhortation: And let </p>
<p>us not commit fornication as some of them. Paul alludes to the Israelites </p>
<p>committing fornication with Moabite women, and 24,000 died as a result </p>
<p>(Num 25:1–18).</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>Again both idolatry and cultic eating are involved. e</p>
<p>Israelites “ate of their sacrices and bowed down in worship to their idols” </p>
<p>(Num 25:2; cf. Ps 106[105]28–31). Paul’s selection of this Scripture possibly </p>
<p>implies for the Corinthian situation a banquet or symposium setting. e </p>
<p>primary task in this verse, however, is more obvious—congregation mem-</p>
<p>bers must ee from fornication wherever they might be tempted to commit </p>
<p>it (6:9–20).</p>
<p>e next warning, let us not test Christ,</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>places Christ once again</p>
<p>in the wilderness. As in 10:4, Paul interprets the Lord God with the Lord </p>
<p>Jesus Christ, and as such, when the wilderness generation tempts or speaks </p>
<p>against the Lord, they tempt Christ (e.g., Exod 17:2, 7; Deut 6:16). eir </p>
<p>speaking against the Lord in Num 21:4–9, alluded to in Ps 78[77]:18–19 as </p>
<p>testing God, is echoed here—many of them were destroyed by serpents. In </p>
<p>that episode they complained about manna, having no food and water, and </p>
<p>115. In 10:5–13 several source texts are noteworthy including Num 11 (Collier </p>
<p>1994:55–75); Exod 32 (Meeks 1982:64–78); Ps 106[105] (Oropeza 2007:136–37); Deut </p>
<p>32 (Oropeza 1998a:57–68).</p>
<p>116. Hwang 2011:580.</p>
<p>117. Paul’s 23,000 may be memory lapse, perhaps with Num 26:62. Or he knew </p>
<p>and/or confused it with another text variant, perhaps of Exod 32:28 (having 23,000 </p>
<p>rather than 3,000). Or he blended numbers from Exod 32:28 and Num 25:9. See op-</p>
<p>tions in Mody 2007:61–79; Schnabel 2006:537–38.</p>
<p>118. Some manuscripts have “Lord” rather than “Christ” in this verse. e latter </p>
<p>is the more dicult reading and is thus more likely the original. See further Osburn </p>
<p>1981:201–12; Oropeza 2007:153–55.</p>
