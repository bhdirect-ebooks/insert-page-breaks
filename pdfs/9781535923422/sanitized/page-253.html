<p>Closing Matters (1 Cor 16:1–24)</p>
<p>229</p>
<p>they are the rstfruits of Achaia—the rst of his converts who have grown </p>
<p>to the point of being able and willing to serve as ministers of the collection.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Perhaps the district of Achaia is mentioned instead of its capitol, Corinth, </p>
<p>because Stephanas’s group will be assisting with the collection for the entire </p>
<p>district inclusive of other churches. ey appointed themselves to be di-</p>
<p>rectly involved with assisting in the collection mentioned earlier—the idea </p>
<p>of one’s dedication for the service to the saints becomes a technical term </p>
<p>associated with the collection (Rom 15:26; 2 Cor 8:4; 9:1, 12).</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> eir self-</p>
<p>appointment, which involves labor and toil, is not motivated by vainglory or </p>
<p>ambition to rule others, but as Barrett adduces, it is due to noticing a need </p>
<p>and then “in a spirit not of self-assertion but of service and humility they </p>
<p>appointed themselves. In other words, they were appointed directly by God, </p>
<p>who pointed out to them the opportunity of service and (we may suppose) </p>
<p>equipped them to full it.”</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>To submit to all such workers in a community</p>
<p>that truly exemplies love (cf. 16:14) is not concerned about abuse related </p>
<p>to the exploitation of power and positions.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>Incidentally, the Corinthians’</p>
<p>submission is not gender specic; they are to comply with female workers, </p>
<p>too, such as Prisca and Phoebe (Rom 16:1).</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>e coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus is the cause </p>
<p>of Paul’s rejoicing. Fortunatus and Achaicus are either independent fellow </p>
<p>believers or members of Stephanas’s house.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>Paul is refreshed by them</p>
<p>because he longs to have fellowship with and nurture the Corinthians; what </p>
<p>was lacking of their physical presence these three representatives have ful-</p>
<p>lled.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>But in what sense did they also refresh the Corinthians (16:18a)?</p>
<p>Since these men are probably couriers for Paul’s letter,</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>he anticipates that</p>
<p>26. Here rstfruits implies growth (Weiss 1910:386) and probably emphasizes </p>
<p>being outstanding rather than literally being rst. Edwards 1897:471, argues that the </p>
<p>region’s rst converts were Athenians (Acts 17:34). It is not clear in Acts, however, that </p>
<p>Paul baptized them.</p>
<p>27. Zeilinger 1997:1.266.</p>
<p>28. Barrett 1968:394.</p>
<p>29. Similarly, see Hays 1997:290.</p>
<p>30. Rightly, Witherington 1995:319, who adds Chloe to this list.</p>
<p>31. Fee 1987:831, claims that both names are common to slaves and freedmen. </p>
<p>32. Compare Paul’s emotionally distraught temperament (“spirit”) longing to nd </p>
<p>Titus, which is then refreshed aer seeing him and hearing his positive report of the </p>
<p>Corinthians (2 Cor 2:12–13; 7:5–7).</p>
<p>33. In less reliable manuscripts, the letter’s subscript includes these names </p>
<p>with Timothy as apparent couriers of the letter (see Metzger/United Bible Societies </p>
<p>1994:504). Did they also earlier bring the Corinthians’ letter to Paul? Since Paul writes </p>
<p>a recommendation for Stephanas and those with him in 16:15–18, this implies that the </p>
<p>Corinthians might be reluctant to cooperate with them (Witherington 1995:319–20). </p>
