<p>Paul and his disciples generally consider homoerotic sexual acts to be a </p>
<p>vice (Rom 1:26–27; 1 Tim 1:10).</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>And some of the Corinthians engaged</p>
<p>in this sexual behavior prior to their conversion—“and such were some of </p>
<p>you” (1 Cor 6:11). The ﬁrst relevant term in 6:9, μαλακός, technically means </p>
<p>a “soft” person, but its immediate context places it in the midst of sexual </p>
<p>vices and thus implies it as another sexual vice. Its meaning in this passage </p>
<p>probably should not be restricted to a “male prostitute” or an “effeminate </p>
<p>call boy.”</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> Paul’s sense is probably closer to that of Philo, a near contem-</p>
<p>porary and Hellenistic Jew. Philo uses μαλακότης for males undergoing a </p>
<p>feminizing process implemented by sexual intercourse with another male </p>
<p>(Abr. 135–37).</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>This person’s role in this sexual union is passive, pointing</p>
<p>to the male whose oriﬁce is penetrated by another male’s penis. This may </p>
<p>be how Paul understands μαλακός in relation with ἀρσενοκοίτης. In this union </p>
<p>it is unlikely that he refers only to pederasty or sex between a slave and his </p>
<p>master or exploiter.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>Otherwise, Paul would be excluding children and those</p>
<p>who are essentially raped by their masters from God’s kingdom! Such are </p>
<p>victims, not vice-doers. If anything, Paul comforts rather than condemns </p>
<p>slaves when their masters abuse them (see notes on 7:21–23). </p>
<p>The second term in 6:9, ἀρσενοκοίτης, may be coined by Paul from </p>
<p>ἀρσεν (“man”) and κοίτης (“bed”) and is probably derived from the pro-</p>
<p>hibitions against same-sex in Lev 18:22 and 20:13(LXX).</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>These verses</p>
<p>come from the same code that informs Paul’s condemnation of incest in </p>
<p>5:1–5 (see ad. loc.). Even though he rejects the works of Mosaic Law as a </p>
<p>71. See e.g., Gagnon 2001:229–303. Rom 1:26–27 also includes lesbianism (Brooten </p>
<p>1996). For Jewish examples, see e.g., Philo, Spec. Leg. 2.50; 3.37–42; Josephus Ag. Ap. </p>
<p>2.25.199, 273; Sib. Or. 2.73–74; 3.185, 764; Ps-Phoc. Sent. 3, 192; T.Naph. 3.4–5; Let. </p>
<p>Aris. 152; Jude 7.</p>
<p>72. Pace NRSV and Skroggs 1983:108, respectively. Martin 2006:47, uses “eemi-</p>
<p>nate,” but this obscures why it would be considered vice. Boswell 1980:107, 338–39, </p>
<p>presents numerous translations and suggests it means a masturbator (see also Country-</p>
<p>man 1988:202), but he adopts this meaning from much later Christian sources.</p>
<p>73. See Gagnon 2001:306–12 (309).</p>
<p>74. Contra Regele 2014:167–68. </p>
<p>75. Or alternatively he adopted it from early rabbinic use: mishkav (b)zakur (“lying </p>
<p>of/with a male”: Skroggs 1983:83, 108), which is nonetheless derived from Mosaic sex </p>
<p>codes.</p>
