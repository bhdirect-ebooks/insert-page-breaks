<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>joy, honor, and other rewards Paul and his team of workers might otherwise </p>
<p>receive on the day of the Lord (cf. 2 Cor 1:14; Phil 2:16; 1 ess 2:19–20).</p>
<p>131</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rewards in the aerlife are not unknown,</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>but in our text any boon</p>
<p>beyond blissful experiences is le unspecied and may be variegated de-</p>
<p>pending on the worker’s labor (3:8, 14).</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>Paul’s warning to be careful how</p>
<p>one builds pertains to all workers in Christ—they must make sure their </p>
<p>messages and teachings are Christ-centered and promote the cruciform </p>
<p>way. Everyone, including all workers, will have to go through the re of es-</p>
<p>chatological judgment and in this manner be puried.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>Hence, the popular</p>
<p>image of this worker escaping the burning house’s re by the “skin of his </p>
<p>teeth” is not accurate. He goes through the re rather than escapes it.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p>Both</p>
<p>worker and work are engulfed in the ames, and only those of quality mate-</p>
<p>rial survive the ordeal.</p>
<p>Do you not know? With this question Paul urges auditors to ponder </p>
<p>on their present behavior (3:16; cf. 5:6; 6:2–3, 9, 15–16, 19; 9:13, 24). e </p>
<p>question might assume they already know from previous teachings what </p>
<p>Paul will now tell them.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>More pointedly, however, it may be expressed</p>
<p>ironically in light of their boastful knowledge as something they ought to </p>
<p>know and do something about. Belief that the Spirit dwells in God’s temple </p>
<p>was not a new concept for Jews,</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>but Paul speaks metaphorically of his</p>
<p>Gentile audience as this sanctuary: Yo u Corinthians are God’s temple! His </p>
<p>aim, as John Lanci arms, is not to replace Jerusalem’s temple, “but to pro-</p>
<p>vide powerful imagery that will engage the emotions of the audience and </p>
<p>kindle in the imagination a dierent way of looking at community.”</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>As</p>
<p>such, Paul implies that this community in Christ is to be holy; the very </p>
<p>Spirit of God dwells in their midst.</p>

<p>134. Although this purication is sometimes understood as purgatory (see Gregory </p>
<p>the Great, Dial. 4.39; Montague 2011:76), it refers to an event taking place at Christ’s </p>
<p>return, not a postmortem state between heaven and hell (Frayer-Griggs 2013b:526).</p>
<p>135 “By re” (“ἐν πυρὶ” 3:13) and “as through re” (“ὡς διὰ πυρός” 3:15) should </p>
<p>probably be understood in an instrumental sense. Notice BDAG 1103, regarding “as” </p>
<p>(ὡς): “marking the manner in which someth. Proceeds . . . corresponding to οὕτως=‘so, </p>
<p>in such a way’ . . . as (one, in an attempt to save oneself, must go) through re (and </p>
<p>therefore suer fr. burns).”</p>
