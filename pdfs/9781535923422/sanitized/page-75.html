<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>

<p>are lords over whatever circumstances might come their way (Seneca, Ben. </p>
<p>7.2.5; Cicero Fin. 3.22.75; Diogenes Laertius Vit. 6.37).</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>But if so, our</p>
<p>apostle recongures its meaning to suggest to the Corinthians that they are </p>
<p>gied with every salvic benet that comes from God. ey are receiving </p>
<p>the future inheritance of the new creation, eternal life, victory over death, </p>
<p>and conquest of the present world through the cross and resurrection, not </p>
<p>because of any power or cleverness of their own, but because they belong </p>
<p>to and have an ultimate allegiance with Christ, and Christ belongs to God. </p>
<p>e eight correlative conjunctions of whether . . . or . . . (εἴτε . . . εἴτε . . . ) </p>
<p>in these verses lead up to and stress this sense of belonging along with its </p>
<p>salvic benets.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>If they have all suciency in Christ, then it follows that</p>
<p>their only ground for boasting is in the Lord. Such privilege subverts any </p>
<p>need to compete their leaders against one another or seek status recognition </p>
<p>based on this world’s standards.</p>
<p>Paul the Administrator and Judgment Day (4:1 –5)</p>
<p>Paul continues his discourse on wisdom and apocalyptic images related to </p>
<p>judgment day. Some add that this section is an apology, a self-defense of </p>
<p>Paul’s character and ministry.</p>
<p>150</p>
<p>His explanation in 4:6, however, along with</p>
<p>further instructions, exhortations, and a call to imitate his behavior (4:1, 5, </p>
<p>14, 16–17), suggest that his primary goal remains a deliberative attempt to </p>
<p>change Corinthian discordant behavior.</p>
<p>His opening exhortation, thus let a person consider, begins a string of </p>
<p>words related to judgment in 4:1–5. In correction of the way he and Apollos </p>
<p>have been placed on pedestals to compete with one another, Paul challenges </p>
<p>the congregation to regard them as mere assistants and administrative </p>
<p>stewards of Christ.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p>e term assistants (ὑπηρέτης) originally referred to</p>
<p>under-rowers in a ship and suggested helpers to someone else as instru-</p>
<p>ments of that person’s will.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>In a religious sense the word describes Cynics</p>
<p>as Zeus’s assistants (Epictetus, Diatr. 3.22.82, 95), and Moses as God’s faith-</p>
<p>ful servant (Josephus Ant. 4.49). In our present context it may designate </p>
<p>someone in an ocial capacity as subordinate to a higher authority.</p>
