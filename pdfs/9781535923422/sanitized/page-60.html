<p>argument), and his scripture citation in 2:9 functions as inartistic proof </p>
<p>(non-invented persuasion based on law, witnesses, oracles, contracts, etc.).</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Several points are noteworthy in 2:6–8 and together they highlight </p>
<p>wisdom in the form of pedagogical and prophetic-apocalyptic discourses. </p>
<p>First, our apostle now takes on the role of a teacher. His verb we speak </p>
<p>(λαλοῦμεν) replaces preaching (καταγγέλλω) to suggest a pedagogical em-</p>
<p>phasis (2:6, 13).</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> Aristotle and other ancient educators spoke in the rst-</p>
<p>person plural, as did teachers of practical exercises on rhetoric. eon’s “we” </p>
<p>in the prelude of his progymnasmata refers to himself before the personal </p>
<p>pronoun includes his students subsequently.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>Similarly, Paul may be using</p>
<p>“we” in 2:6–7a inclusive of himself and perhaps his colleagues as teachers, </p>
<p>and then he seems to include his many students who have received God’s </p>
<p>Spirit in 2:7b, 12. Given a time in which orators were hired by wealthy par-</p>
<p>ents who sought to have their sons trained in rhetorical skills for future </p>
<p>public careers,</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>it follows that Paul might discuss an alternative form of</p>
<p>education in wisdom.</p>
<p>Second, Paul teaches wisdom among those who are mature. Are these </p>
<p>his Corinthian recipients? Yes, because they have received the prerequisite </p>
<p>of God’s Spirit needed to discern this wisdom (6:11, 19; 12:13)—and no, </p>
<p>because they still behave immaturely (3:1–3). ey still need to realize the </p>
<p>implications of who they are as Christ’s followers.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> Maturity here imag-</p>
<p>ines advanced or adult learners who understand and live up to standards </p>
<p>of teachings disclosed to them. A state of being mature or τέλειος may </p>
<p>suggest completeness in training (cf. 14:19–20; cf. Col 1:28; Eph 4:11–13).</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is term is used also of skilled sophists and philosophers (Isocrates An-</p>
<p>tidosis 199–200; Plato Phaedr. 269E; Crat. 403E; Philo Det. 32–49, 65–68, </p>
<p>132–33).</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>Perhaps certain Corinthians used it to identify skillful orators.</p>
<p>When Paul denies speaking with words taught by human wisdom (2:13), </p>
<p>as Pogolo discerns, “the most natural teachers would be the rhetorical </p>
<p>67. On the proofs, see e.g., Aristotle Rhet. 1.2.2–7; 1.15.1–33.</p>
<p>68. Cf. λαλέω + διδακτός (2:13) with λαλέω + διδασκαλία (Tit 2:1). Notice also “in-</p>
<p>struct” (συμβιβάζω) in 1 Cor 2:16. He also emphasizes knowing verbs: οἶδα in 2:11–12 </p>
<p>and γιγνώσκω in 2:8[2 x], 11, 14, 16. e latter may relate to “greater insight into things </p>
<p>spiritual, the product of education and culture” (Welborn 1987b:105).</p>
