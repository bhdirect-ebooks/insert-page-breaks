<p>argues this point perhaps in the face of inscriptions of his day that alleg-</p>
<p>edly conferred the rhetoric of immortality to champion athletes and their </p>
<p>benefactors.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>e coveted wreath was emblematic of great honor and status</p>
<p>for champions.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>For Paul, greater honor and glory await winners of the</p>
<p>race for salvic life, and the imperishable wreath intimates the immortal, </p>
<p>resurrected body that becomes the believers’ legacy when Christ returns </p>
<p>(15:20–24).</p>
<p>Paul presents himself as an exemplar for the Corinthians. He does not </p>
<p>run aimlessly, but with purpose and resolution he determines to nish the </p>
<p>race and obtain the salvic prize (cf. Phil 3:14). He does not ght as a boxer </p>
<p>who beats the air but strikes with precision to make every blow count in or-</p>
<p>der to defeat the opponent.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>To win, Paul must train by punishing his body</p>
<p>with blows</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> of self-imposed discipline in order to subjugate it into obedi-</p>
<p>ence that it might be t for the contest. In essence, he enslaves his own body </p>
<p>so that his bodily appetites and sinful nature do not enslave him.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>metaphoric training also may recall his bodily hardships experienced as a </p>
<p>missionary, including labors, beatings, and lack of food and sleep whether </p>
<p>from travelling, moonlighting as a minister, or prayer and fasting vigils (2 </p>
<p>Cor 11:23–27).</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>Such experiences have a way of building one’s faith and</p>
<p>self-discipline. </p>
<p>It may be signicant that Paul uses κηρύσσω rather than εὐαγγελίζω </p>
<p>as his word for proclaiming (9:27). e former relates κῆρυξ, which re-</p>
fers to the herald of athletic games. is individual declared competitive
<p>rules, called athletes to the track, and proclaimed the good news of vic-</p>
<p>tory to the winners.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>Although Paul’s apostolic ministry ts well with this</p>
<p>description, unlike the herald, he also participates in the contest and must </p>
<p>prepare well so that he himself will not be disqualied (i.e., excluded from </p>
<p>the competition).</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>Given that the prize is nal salvation, disqualication</p>
<p>pine was used (Broneer 1962:16–17).</p>
<p>93. See examples in Harrison 2008:106–7.</p>
<p>94. Dutch 2005:236–37; further, Papathomas 1997:225–33.</p>
<p>95. Beating the air does not refer to shadow boxing but to the inexperienced </p>
<p>boxer who fails to land punches against an agile opponent (Popovic 2014:33; Metzner </p>
<p>2000:575).</p>
<p>96. BDAG 1043: ὑπωπιάζω is to “strike under the eye, give a black eye to.”</p>
<p>97. Building on bodily enslavement, Concannon 2014:202–9, adds gladiator </p>
<p>games to the scene.</p>
<p>98. On sports competition analogous to hardships, compare Dio Chrysostom Or. </p>
<p>8.11–19.</p>
<p>99. Cf. Harrison 2008:102; Popovic 2004:38–39.</p>
<p>100. For examples of game disqualication, see Hullinger 2004:356–59; Harrison </p>
<p>2008:101. </p>
