<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>67</p>
<p>apostle is with them through the words of his letter (Col 2:5; cf. Seneca </p>
<p>Lucil. 40:1–4; Demetrius Eloc. 227).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>e reader who performs this letter</p>
<p>before the Corinthians represents Paul’s “spirit” (i.e., Paul’s authoritative and </p>
<p>Spirit-led thoughts, intentions, and decisions in relation to this matter). In </p>
<p>keeping with ancient spiritual cosmology, however, it is perhaps more likely </p>
<p>that Paul believes he will in some sense actually be present with them by the </p>
<p>power of God’s Spirit that dwells among them all (6:17; 12:12, 27). is is not </p>
<p>astral projection but similar to clairvoyance in the sense of “seeing” some-</p>
<p>thing at a dierent location take place without being there in physical body. </p>
is divine gi, which seems prophetic in nature, is akin with Jesus seeing
<p>Nathanael under the g tree without being physically present, or Elisha’s </p>
<p>“heart” being present to witness Gehazi’s deed when his protégé was not </p>
<p>physically with him (John 1:47–48; 2 Kgs 5:26). Perhaps Paul believes that </p>
<p>God’s Spirit will prompt him at the right moment to “see” or otherwise sense </p>
<p>when the congregation will be confronting the fornicator. At that moment, </p>
<p>even though he will not be physically present with them, he will be able to </p>
<p>intercede, praying to God for them as they pronounce judgment against the </p>
<p>oender. e apostle being “present” adds authority to the event as a witness </p>
<p>and judge against the man (cf. 2 Cor 13:1–2/ Deut. 17:6–7; 19:15).</p>
<p>e verdict against the oender is expulsion.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>He is ocially cut o</p>
<p>from belonging to the community in Christ. Paul makes this judgment in </p>
<p>the name of our Lord Jesus, suggesting a formulaic reversal of the man’s </p>
<p>entrance ritual of baptism “in the name of Jesus” that enabled him to par-</p>
<p>ticipate in the corporate body of Christ (6:11; 12:12–13, 27; cf. 1:14; Acts </p>
<p>2:38).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Such punishment apparently functions as an exit ritual from the</p>
<p>community in Christ.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>As a bona de apostle of the Lord, Paul can use the</p>
<p>name (i.e., authority) of Jesus with condence that his words and actions are </p>
divinely endorsed.
<p>is expulsion bears some similarities to ancient curse formulae in </p>
<p>which victims and oenders are handed over to deities so that calamities </p>
<p>might befall them.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>e incestuous man is handed over to Satan for the</p>
<p>destruction of the esh. Unlike pagan curses, however, the purpose of this </p>
<p>calamity is remedial, in hope of the oender’s ultimate salvation: so that the </p>

<p>11. See Oropeza 2012a:78–79; Callow 1992:205–6; Forkman 1972. </p>
<p>12. e placement of this phrase with the right contextual verb or verbs is noto-</p>
<p>riously dicult (see Allo 1956:121, for options). When combined with the parallel </p>
<p>“power of our Lord Jesus” (5:4b), this suggests that Paul, not the oender, is doing the </p>
<p>action related to Jesus’s name.</p>
