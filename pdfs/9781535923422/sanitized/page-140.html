<p>e wives of Cephas (Peter) and the brothers of the</p>
<p>Lord (James and other brothers of Jesus: cf. 15:7; Gal 1:19; Mark 6:3) appar-</p>
<p>ently accompanied them on their missions.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>Missionary couples working</p>
<p>with Paul include Prisca and Aquila (Rom 16:3–5; Acts 18:2, 26) and Junia </p>
<p>and Andronicus (Rom 16:7).</p>
<p>Paul and Barnabas may be somewhat unique with their “pay our own </p>
<p>way” policy on missionary trips. e Corinthians knew Barnabas even </p>
<p>though in Acts 18 he is not mentioned with Paul when the latter went to </p>
<p>Corinth.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>Perhaps Barnabas visited them aerward, whether sometime</p>
<p>during Paul’s year and a half stay or aerward. Paul asks ironically, or only </p>
<p>I and Barnabas do not have a right to refrain from working? Whenever </p>
<p>possible Paul raised his own support money as a tentmaker (Acts 18:3; cf. </p>
<p>1 Cor 4:12; 2 Cor 11:27; 1 ess 2:9).</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>Despite Paul’s practice, no apostle is</p>
<p>required to do other work when proclaiming the gospel. His claim is sup-</p>
<p>ported by three analogical questions expecting “no one” as the answer (9:7). </p>
<p>First, no soldier goes to war and has to provide his own food and provisions; </p>
<p>second, no farmer refrains from eating fruit from the vineyard he plants; </p>
<p>and third, no shepherd refrains from consuming the milk of his ock. e </p>
<p>point in agreement with apostolic ministry is that those who work at their </p>
<p>roles are able to eat from their own labor.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>To support this further Paul cites Scripture: For it is written in the </p>
<p>Law of Moses, “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads grain” (9:9; </p>
<p>cf. Deut 25:4).</p>
<p>48</p>
<p> e context in Deuteronomy supports the notion of pro-</p>
<p>moting justice economically.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>Poor workers, for example, should not be</p>
<p>deprived of a prompt return for their labor (24:13–14), and both laborers </p>
<p>and marginalized people are entitled to eat.</p>

<p>44. ese brothers (ἀδελφοί) may be Joseph’s sons from a previous marriage (Prot. </p>
<p>Jas. 9.1–2), Jesus’s non-sibling relatives (Montague 2011:153; but ἀνεψιός, not ἀδελφοί, </p>
<p>is used in Col 4:10), or more likely in my opinion, the actual siblings of Jesus (and </p>
<p>normal meaning of ἀδελφός). See Matt 12:46–50; 13:54–55; Luke 8:19–21; John 2:12; </p>
<p>7:3–5; Acts 1:14.</p>
