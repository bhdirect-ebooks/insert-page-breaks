<p>litical debates.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>e oratory and political realms frequently overlapped one</p>
<p>another, especially when sophists participated in city assemblies and could </p>
<p>be sent on embassies before magistrates. Oen, their success in political </p>
<p>circles caused them to be pued up and provoked caricatures of them as </p>
<p>windbags.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Our apostle’s language imagines a situation in which the strife</p>
<p>in Corinth includes comparisons related to persona and quarrels over the </p>
<p>oratory skills of their Christian leaders.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Divisive Alliances and Baptism (1:11–17) </p>
<p>e reason Paul exhorts them is because it has been reported to me con-</p>
<p>cerning you, my brothers and sisters, by those of Chloe, that there are </p>
<p>discords among you. Chloe is presumably a member of the Corinthian </p>
<p>congregation who is an independent woman of high status, the mater </p>
<p>familias or head of her own household. ose associated with her prob-</p>
<p>ably belong to her household, whether family members, slaves, or former </p>
<p>slaves.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>ey appear to be carriers of the Corinthians’ letter to Paul (see</p>
<p>7:1).</p>
<p>14</p>
ey either told him about divisions that were not mentioned in the
<p>letter, or more likely, he received this news from the letter (and perhaps </p>
<p>their elaboration of it) that they read to him. In ancient papyri letters the </p>
<p>passive reporting used here normally refers to written rather than oral </p>
<p>information.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>In 1:11 the word for discord (ἔρις) Philo uses to describe sophist rival-</p>
<p>ries (Mut. 10; Her. 246).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Eris is also the name of the goddess of discord. In</p>
<p>Greek mythology she creates a golden apple with the inscription, “For the </p>
<p>fairest,” and presents it as a gi at a wedding feast. Hera, Athena, and Aph-</p>
<p>rodite, goddesses at the feast, quarrel over which one of them should have </p>
<p>the apple. Zeus instructs them to ask the noble-bred Paris of Troy to decide </p>
<p>which goddess is the fairest, and he chooses Aphrodite who had bribed him </p>
<p>with the promise of giving him beautiful Helen, wife of Menelaus the My-</p>

<p>13. Other options include that they are business agents of Chloe (possibly a non-</p>
<p>Christian from Ephesus: Fee 1987:54) or a woman’s group opposed to hierarchical </p>
<p>structures of the factional groups (Schottro 2012:720–21).</p>
