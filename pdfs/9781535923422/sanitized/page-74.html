<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>let him become foolish so that he may become wise.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>is inverted way</p>
<p>of thinking recapitulates earlier thoughts in which weakness related to the </p>
crucied Christ marks truly divine wisdom and power, and what is wise in
<p>this world is foolishness in God’s sight (e.g., 1:18–25). </p>
<p>Two quotes from Israel’s scriptures reinforce the idea. e rst seems </p>
<p>to be a loose reference to Job 5:13 in which God is the one who catches </p>
<p>the wise in their own crainess.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>Paul may have been attracted to the</p>
<p>wisdom in Job 5 because, complementary with what he argues, God gra-</p>
<p>ciously waters earth (Job 5:11/1 Cor 3:7), and there is an anticipated day </p>
<p>in which darkness will come upon the wise (Job 5:14/1 Cor 3:13) as well as </p>
<p>a request that clever ones be destroyed (Job 5:15/1 Cor 3:17). For Paul, the </p>
<p>catching of the clever ones means more than simply making their wisdom </p>
<p>look foolish, as Job’s context and Paul’s similar language in 1:18–19 make </p>
<p>clear. e second scripture comes from Ps 94[93]:11—the Lord knows </p>
<p>the thoughts of the wise; that they are useless.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>Hook words relevant</p>
<p>for Paul, such as wise, fools, and the idea of cultivation with the God who </p>
<p>plants (94[93]:8–9), may have drawn him to this psalm aer being informed </p>
<p>by Job. Likewise in this text, the Lord judges with recompense the proud </p>
<p>and boastful (94[93]:1–3), similar to how Paul connects the advocates of </p>
<p>worldly wisdom with arrogance and boasting (3:21; cf. 1:31; 4:6–7, 18–19). </p>
<p>Together these quotes conrm that human cleverness is folly before God, </p>
and divine judgment awaits those who are deceived by it.
<p>e nal imperative in this passage exhorts the Corinthians to let no </p>
one boast in humans. is seems to reference their divisive claims of al-
<p>legiances to Paul, Apollos, and Cephas (cf. 1:12) and advances a compelling </p>
<p>resolution. ese allegiances are turned upside down by Paul’s assertion that </p>
<p>he and other leaders belong to them—they are committed to serving the </p>
<p>Corinthians and being in solidarity with this congregation. Moreover, he </p>
<p>arms to them that all things are yours! is armation may be adopted </p>
<p>from the Stoic maxim, “all things belong to the wise person;” that is, sages </p>
<p>145. In 3:18 γενέσθω may be imperative or ingressive aorist indicating the start of </p>
<p>the act (istelton 2000:321).</p>
<p>146. Paul refers to God as ὁ δρασσόμενος (“the one who catches”), but Job 5:13 uses </p>
<p>ὁ καταλαμβάνων, which is similar in meaning. His version may reect a Hebraizing of </p>
<p>the LXX or a dierent Greek variant (see Stanley 1992:189–92). In any case δράσσομαι </p>
<p>(more than καταλαμβάνω) reects the ease of this activity (Inkelaar 2011:288). Job </p>
<p>5:13(LXX) uses “cleverness” (φρόνησις) instead of “crainess” (πανουργία). Paul’s </p>
<p>πανουργία may be inuenced by Job 5:12, which states that God changes the counsel of </p>
<p>“the cray ones” (πανούργων). </p>
<p>147. Ps 93:11(LXX) has the thoughts “of men” (ἀνθρώπων) rather than thoughts “of </p>
<p>the wise” (σοφῶν). Perhaps Paul changed the wording by connecting the term “wise” </p>
<p>from 93:8 with 93:11 so as to stress wisdom in his own quote.</p>
