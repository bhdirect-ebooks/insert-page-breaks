<p>31</p>
<p>instead disclosed the mystery of God (2:1).</p>
<p>42</p>
is refers to the divine plan
<p>of salvation,</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>and for Paul that plan nds its center in the message of the</p>
<p>cross. When he rst preached to them he decided to know nothing among </p>
<p>them; that is, he regarded nothing to be of primary importance in his gospel </p>
<p>except Jesus Christ and him crucied (2:2).</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>His coming to their city and</p>
<p>preaching in this manner contrasts sophists entering a town and expecting </p>
<p>to be greeted by enthusiastic crowds, invited to declaim in their midst, and </p>
<p>followed by young men desiring to become their students (Dio Chrysostom </p>
<p>Or. 47.22; Aristides Or. 51.29–34; Philostratus Vit. soph. 2.571–72).</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul’s presence among the Corinthians exemplied weakness . . . fear </p>
<p>and much trembling.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>is description conicts with that of sophists who</p>
<p>are typically characterized by condence, courage, good looks, great rhe-</p>
<p>torical skills, and a commanding presence (see Excursus). Paul’s weakness, </p>
<p>fear, and trembling characterize instead the type of stage fright experienced </p>
<p>by nervous orators (cf. Cicero De or. 1.xxvi.120; xxvii.123). Speakers might </p>
<p>show signs of being intimidated by their audiences by blushing, perspir-</p>
<p>ing, stuttering, or trembling (Seneca Lucil. 11; Pliny Ep. 7.17).</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>A prime</p>
<p>example of this is when Demosthenes, whose reputation of masterful elo-</p>
<p>quence was renowned, speaks in the presence of Philip of Macedon. Instead </p>
<p>of exuberating great condence, the famous orator was frightened out of his </p>
<p>wits and even collapsed before the monarch, failing to continue his speech </p>
<p>(Aeschines Fals. leg. 21–22, 34–35). It is quite plausible to suggest that Paul </p>
<p>showed bodily signs of weakness or nervousness when speaking; in later </p>
<p>correspondence some Corinthians consider his bodily presence to be weak </p>
<p>and his speeches detestable (cf. 2 Cor 10:10; 11:6). His weakness would </p>
<p>seem to indicate a person of lowly status, the way Plutarch describes poor </p>
<p>speakers who are ugly, servile, needy, dishonored, and unlearned, unlike </p>
<p>wise sages who are eloquent, handsome, wealthy, and learned (Frat. amor. </p>
<p>42. Some Greek manuscripts have μαρτύριον (“testimony” cf. 1:6) instead of </p>
<p>μυστήριον (“mystery”). My tentative choice of the latter prepares for 2:7 (see Metzger, </p>
<p>480).</p>
<p>43. Cf. Dan 2:28; 2 Bar. 81.4; 1QpHab 7.4–8; Perkins 2012:59. </p>
<p>44. is resolve was not a new decision but Paul’s normal practice (Gal 3:1; Fee </p>
<p>1987:92).</p>
<p>45. Winter 2002:144–47; Russell 1983:76–80.</p>
<p>46. Possibly, “fear and trembling” is lied from Isa 19:16, or alternatively, what </p>
prophets experience when confronted with divine revelation or mysteries (Dan 7:15;
<p>10:7–9; 1 En. 14.14; Selby 1997:368–70).</p>
<p>47. In Acts 19:12 Paul’s sweat cloths might reect his perspiration when speaking, </p>
<p>but then again the sweat might be from his labor as a tent-maker.</p>
