<p>Closing Matters (1 Cor 16:1–24)</p>
<p>228</p>
<p>Apollos may visit them later on when a future opportunity arises; Paul </p>
<p>leaves unmentioned that that opportunity may be contingent upon the </p>
<p>Corinthians ending their rivalries.</p>
<p>Epistolary Close (16:13–24)</p>
<p>Paul advances some closing exhortations, a feature typically found toward </p>
<p>the end of his letters (e.g., 2 Cor 13:11; 1 ess 5:16–22; Phil 4:8–9; Rom </p>
<p>16:17). e brief imperatives in 16:13–14 are in the present tense, “call-</p>
<p>ing for a continuous response.”</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>e rst four are agonistic, resembling</p>
<p>exhortations common to military battles, such as when Archidamus ex-</p>
<p>horts Peloponnesian ocers before their expedition against the Athenians </p>
<p>(ucydides, Hist. 2.11.9) and Ajax encourages the Argives to continue </p>
<p>ghting the Trojans (Homer, Il. 15.559–65). Paul encourages the Corinthi-</p>
<p>ans to struggle successfully against inuential forces that might undermine </p>
<p>the gospel of their salvation. e imperative, be alert, will ensure that no </p>
<p>such inuences catch them o guard so that their spiritual life is jeopardized </p>
<p>before Christ’s second coming (e.g. 1:7–8; 3:13; 4:3–5; cf. 1 ess 5:6–10). </p>
<p>ey must stand rm in faith, which has as its object belief in and commit-</p>
<p>ment to Christ and the gospel (15:1–2, 14, 17, 58). e imperatives, show </p>
<p>courage and be strong, are found together when General Joab encourages </p>
<p>his brother Abishai to be valorous in battle against Israel’s enemies (2 Sam </p>
<p>10:12 [LXX]).</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>Paul, however, seems to have in view a battle against life’s</p>
<p>hardships along with resisting temptation. Cowardice in this realm can lead </p>
<p>to spiritual defection (cf. Mart. Pol. 4.1; 9.1; Rev 21:8). Paradoxically, when </p>
<p>it comes to vice, sometimes the bravest thing to do is ee from it (6:18; </p>
<p>10:14). e last brief imperative recalls our apostle’s words about being con-</p>
<p>siderate of others and fostering unity among members: Let everything you </p>
<p>do be done in love (cf. 8:1–3; 12:31—13:13).</p>
<p>Final appeals in this letter urge compliance with ministerial workers </p>
<p>currently with Paul in Ephesus and soon leaving for Corinth (16:15–18). e </p>
<p>congregation is to submit to all such workers, and in particular the house </p>
<p>of Stephanas, which may include family members, slaves, or freedmen. </p>
<p>Stephanas may be fairly wealthy as the head of a large household and with </p>
<p>means to travel. is household, along with Crispus and Gaius, were the </p>
<p>only converts baptized by Paul when he was in Corinth (1:14–16). As such, </p>
<p>24. Collins 1999:599.</p>
<p>25. e former is more literally to “act like a man” (ἀνδρίζομαι), which may be </p>
<p>contrasted with acting childishly and cowardly (iselton 2000:1336). Dierently, </p>
<p>Mayordomo-Marin 2011:515–28, contrasts it with acting womanish (but see Musonius </p>
<p>Rufus, Lect 4, on women having courage).</p>
