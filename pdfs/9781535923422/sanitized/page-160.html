<p>e second circumstance involves mixed dining and imagines at least </p>
<p>three persons beside the believing guest—the host who invites the believer </p>
<p>for dinner, the informant who tells the guest about the sacricial food, and </p>
<p>another whose conscience might be adversely aected by the guest eating </p>
<p>idol food. e host is a Gentile, one of the unbelievers, whether patron, </p>
<p>colleague, friend, or relative. Congregation members of more prestigious </p>
<p>backgrounds might receive such invitations rather than the lower classes </p>
<p>and slaves. Paul encourages these dining guests to eat whatever is set before </p>
<p>you, asking no questions about the food. But if someone there says to the </p>
<p>believer that the food is oered to a god, Paul charges believers, do not to </p>
<p>eat for the sake of the person who informed you. e informant is another </p>
<p>unbelieving Gentile; this person uses the more reverential ἱερόθυτος (“of-</p>
<p>fered to a god”) rather than the pejorative εἰδωλόθυτος (“sacriced to an </p>
<p>idol”) that Paul and other emergent Christians use (Acts 15:29; Rev 2:14; </p>
<p>Did. 6.3). e believer is to refrain from eating because unbelievers who are </p>
<p>present might think the believer is hypocritical by claiming to worship one </p>
<p>God and yet eating in honor of another (cf. 10:30). From the unbeliever’s </p>
<p>perspective, the believer’s acceptance of idol food might be tantamount to </p>
<p>endorsing the god to whom it was oered.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p>e unbeliever might also feel</p>
<p>justied in worshipping other gods because of this.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>Upon hearing that</p>
<p>he is eating idol food, the believer is to refrain also for the sake of another </p>
<p>person’s conscience (10:28c–29a), which may assume a weak believer is </p>
<p>present. Were other people invited to this dinner? Are any of the slaves </p>
<p>who serve the meal believers? Will weak congregation members see or hear </p>
<p>about this dinner? Any of these cases might result in consequences similar </p>
<p>to 8:7–13; hence, the believing guest should not eat the food.</p>
<p>Typical of deliberative rhetoric the conclusion in 10:29b—11:1 reca-</p>
<p>pitulates themes discussed earlier in the discourse.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>Two leading questions</p>
<p>reiterate the points of strong members. e rst one—why is my freedom </p>
<p>judged by another’s conscience?—seems to protest consideration for weak </p>
<p>members. e second—if I partake with thankfulness (i.e., I give thanks </p>
<p>to God for the food), why am I being maligned for that which I give </p>
<p>thanks?—seems to protest unbelievers at the dinner invitation in 10:28 who </p>
<p>might slander them for being inconsistent in their beliefs and practices.</p>
