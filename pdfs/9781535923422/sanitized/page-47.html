<p>Wisdom and Leadership in Light </p>
<p>of the Proclamation of the Cross: </p>
<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>
<p>e rst supporting proof of the appeal for unity centers on the procla-</p>
<p>mation of the cross among Jews and Gentiles (1:18–31).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Paul then applies</p>
<p>the content of this message to his own persona and preaching in relation </p>
<p>to spiritual wisdom (2:1–16), and subsequently to Apollos and himself as </p>
<p>ministers (3:1—4:5). Aer this he makes another appeal, this time for his </p>
<p>recipients to imitate him (4:6–16), and he warns them to be prepared for his </p>
<p>upcoming visit (4:17–21). ese passages reveal that apart from competi-</p>
<p>tive allegiances, the congregation is plagued by quarreling, misperceptions </p>
<p>about wisdom and speech, and boasting related to status. </p>
<p>Wisdom and Foolishness of the Cross (1:18–31)</p>
<p>e type of eloquence that our apostle discourages from becoming preem-</p>
<p>inent in the congregation does not prevent him from exhibiting his own </p>
<p>stylistic features throughout the rest of this chapter, including rhetorical </p>
<p>questions (1:20), chiasm (1:22 – 23), irony (1:21, 25, 27–28), anaphora </p>
<p>or stressed repetition (“not many . . . not many . . . ”: 1:26), and antith-</p>
<p>eses: perishing/being saved (1:18), foolishness/power (1:18), foolish/wise </p>
<p>(1:21–25, 27), wisdom of God/wisdom of the world (1:20–21), weakness/</p>
<p>strength (1:25, 27), noble/lowly (1:26, 28), and things that are/things that </p>
<p>are not (1:28).</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>e message of the cross refers to the apostolic proclamation about </p>
<p>Christ crucied. is message elicits antithetical responses that interact </p>
<p>with wisdom and prophetic-apocalyptic discourses. ose who are being </p>
<p>saved believe in the message of the cross, and for them it provides a chan-</p>
<p>nel for God’s power to save and transform their lives as well as endow them </p>
