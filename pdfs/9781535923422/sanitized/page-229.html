<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>
<p>205</p>
<p>e conclusion in 15:19 relates both to points A and D, and hence, </p>
<p>the entire chain may be implied in this verse. e Lord’s resurrection is the </p>
<p>essential ground for faith and salvation (15:12–19; cf. Rom 4:25; 10:9). </p>
<p>ere are ve disadvantages, directly or indirectly, if Christ has not </p>
<p>been raised from the dead. First, the apostles’ proclamation is in vain. </p>
<p>Since the gospel tradition proclaimed by Jesus’ disciples is that Christ died </p>
<p>for our sins, was buried, and rose again (15:3–4), without the resurrec-</p>
<p>tion, the central proclamation of the gospel becomes emptied of its power </p>
<p>as a direct result of Christ not being raised. Without the objective fact of </p>
<p>Christ’s resurrection, the content of apostolic proclamation is compro-</p>
<p>mised—it cannot be dealing with reality.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>Second, since the Corinthians</p>
<p>believed that proclamation (15:1–2), which is in vain if Christ is not risen, </p>
<p>then it follows that their faith in the proclamation also is in vain. ey </p>
<p>have believed a false message. is is the direct result of a vain procla-</p>
<p>mation that arises from Christ not being raised.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>ird, the apostles turn</p>
<p>out to be false witnesses concerning God. ey proclaim that God raised </p>
<p>Jesus when God did not; thus, they testify against God by claiming God </p>
<p>did something God did not do. Fourth, the Corinthians are still enslaved </p>
<p>in their sins. is seems to follow directly from their faith being in vain. </p>
<p>eir sins are not forgiven because their faith has been nullied by be-</p>
<p>lieving in a gospel that proclaims Christ is risen when he has not risen. </p>
<p>Paul also may be inferring that without Christ’s resurrection, the expiation </p>
<p>related to his death as spoken through his own words and prophetic Scrip-</p>
<p>ture (11:24–25; 15:3) is invalidated. Christ’s death has not been vindicated </p>
<p>by God without the resurrection. In addition to this, since sin and death </p>
<p>are inextricably bound together being generated from Adam’s original sin </p>
<p>(15:21–23, 54–57; Rom 5:12; 6:23), we can agree with N. T. Wright that “if </p>
<p>God has overcome death in the resurrection of Jesus, then the power of sin </p>
<p>is broken; but if he hasn’t, it isn’t.”</p>
<p>42</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally, those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. is </p>
<p>sleep refers to death (7:39; 11:30; 15:7). Paul’s assumption, comparable </p>
<p>with Jewish apocalyptic, is that the body sleeps in death and will wake </p>
<p>up and rise again (15:20, 51; 1 ess 4:13–15; cf. Dan 12:2; T. Jud. 25.4).</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is hypothetical condition of the dead in Christ having perished is the </p>
<p>outcome of the sorites of those still enslaved to sin as a result of useless </p>
<p>40. See Schnabel 2006:914.</p>
<p>41. Paul mentions a vain faith again in 15:17b, but here he omits the middle link </p>
<p>of the vain proclamation of the gospel assuming the auditors already know this from </p>
<p>verse 14.</p>
