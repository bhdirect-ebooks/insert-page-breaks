<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>
<p>223</p>
<p>sin, and his arguments against the works of the Law are compatible with </p>
<p>his claim that the power of sin is the Law (Gal 2:4; 4:8–11; 4:21—5:1; Rom </p>
<p>6:6–7, 20; 8:2). For Paul, Moses’s Law, though attempting to create proper </p>
<p>boundaries around sin and bring punishment against sinners, exacerbates </p>
<p>the problem because it makes humans more aware of sin, condemns them </p>
<p>because of it, and cannot ultimately deliver them from it—freedom from </p>
<p>sin comes through faith in Christ (Gal 3:19–26; Rom 7:1—8:11). Paul does </p>
<p>not elaborate on the Law in our current text or elsewhere in this letter (but </p>
<p>see 7:17–19; 9:20–21). We could surmise that he previously taught the Cor-</p>
<p>inthians about it in similar terms as his other letters, and they agreed with </p>
<p>him. Hence, he assumes they will agree with him on its role in relation to sin </p>
<p>without further explanation. </p>
<p>Paul’s thanksgiving over death in 15:57 perhaps informs his later </p>
<p>thanksgiving in Rom 7:25, since both are mentioned in relation to sin and </p>
<p>the Law. He praises God for granting believers victory through Jesus Christ </p>
<p>our Lord, which invites us to imagine a nal triumphal procession scene, </p>
<p>this time reversing the imagery of Christ’s death on the cross (1:18) and the </p>
<p>apostles’ death as captives of war (4:9–15). e procession is clearly in honor </p>
<p>of the believers in Christ who are now conquerors over sin and death. </p>
<p>e concluding exhortation recalls the similar pattern of exhortations </p>
<p>in 15:29–34 and thus completes the second formal sequence of the A, B, </p>
<p>C, D pattern in this chapter (see above). Paul’s urge for his auditors to be </p>
<p>steadfast and immovable forms an inclusio with their standing and holding </p>
<p>rm the gospel in 15:1–2.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>ey must persevere in the gospel proclaimed to</p>
<p>them, which anticipates their own bodily resurrection. e nal appeal for </p>
<p>them to be always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your </p>
<p>labor is not in vain in the Lord alludes to Isa 65:23 in which God’s “chosen </p>
<p>ones” will “not labor (κοπιάω) in vain.” e context speaks of consolation </p>
<p>for God’s people who anticipate the promised creation of the new heaven </p>
<p>and new earth (65:17).</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>Perhaps Paul recongures this promise to mean</p>
<p>that the believers’ present service done for the Lord’s sake, despite any dif-</p>
<p>culties they might face, would not be in vain but result in their glorious </p>
<p>transformation when the new creation is fully present. A reward for one’s </p>
<p>labor seems more relevant to Paul’s own labor than the Corinthians’, but our </p>
<p>apostle seems to envision a day of recompense for all the faithful in Christ </p>
<p>throughout the world (2 Cor 5:10; Rom 2:6, 16; cf. 1 Cor 3:8–15; 4:5). At </p>
<p>that time the people who have hoped in God will celebrate over their salva-</p>
<p>tion, “because God will give us rest” (Isa 25:10 LXX).</p>
