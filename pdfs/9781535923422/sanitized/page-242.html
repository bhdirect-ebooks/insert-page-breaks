<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>

<p>able, made of dust since they originate from the man of dust. Paul’s words, </p>
<p>just as we have worn the image of the man of dust, recall Adam being </p>
<p>created in God’s image and from the dust (Gen 1:26–27; 2:7). e “image” </p>
<p>nonetheless also points to Gen 5:1–3. Adam fathers Seth in his own image; </p>
<p>that is, Adam’s son bore the same qualities and likeness of his human father.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For Paul, then, image (εἰκών) speaks to bodily identity and aliation with </p>
<p>predecessors, whether with Adam and imperfection or Christ and perfec-</p>
<p>tion.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>Dierently, Christ, the last Adam, is a heavenly man, not because</p>
<p>in the resurrection he has been created of some sort of heavenly substance </p>
<p>void of any continuum with his earthly body, but because he is now associ-</p>
<p>ated with the realm of heaven (1 ess 1:10; 4:16; Rom 10:6). What is heav-</p>
<p>enly characterizes the state or mode of existence Paul already mentioned in </p>
<p>15:42–45. e risen Christ has a body that is Spirit-energized, imperishable, </p>
and glorious, shining with radiance from being in the immediate divine
<p>presence (2 Cor 4:4, 6). ose who follow the last Adam will be transformed </p>
<p>into the last Adam’s image; i.e., into the likeness of the risen Savior who, </p>
<p>among other things, is imperishable and glorious (Phil 3:20–21; 2 Cor 3:18; </p>
<p>Rom 8:29). Important here is the implication that the believers’ resurrection </p>
<p>will be of the same sort as Christ’s resurrection. ey are “oered a possibil-</p>
<p>ity to imitate the resurrected Christ.”</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>e nal words in this section both</p>
<p>urge and anticipate the full realization of that transformation at the second </p>
<p>coming as though wearing radiant apparel—let us also wear the image of </p>
<p>the man of heaven.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>Transformation and the Defeat of Death (15:50–58)</p>
<p>e conjunctive now (δέ) combined with the vocative brothers and sis-</p>
<p>ters and this I say . . . that suggest a new paragraph starts at 15:50.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>unstated question that opens this pericope probably asks, “What happens </p>
<p>102. See e.g., Worthington 2011:192–94.</p>
<p>103. Cf. Lorenzen 2008:256, 272.</p>

105. Ancient witnesses are divided between the future rendering, “we will also wear
<p>(φορέσομεν)” and the hortatory subjunctive, “let us also wear (φορέσωμεν).” If the </p>
<p>greater amount of ancient witnesses and harder reading is preferable in such decisions, </p>
<p>φορέσωμεν should clearly be the winner: e.g., p46, א, A, C, D (φορέσομεν is supported </p>
<p>by e.g., B). Paul wants to convince his auditors to accept their future resurrection; </p>
<p>without doing so their faith might turn out to be in vain, and if that were the case, </p>
<p>they would miss out on that transformation. Notice that Paul also ends three distinct </p>
<p>pericopae with exhortations (15:33–34, 49, 58).</p>
