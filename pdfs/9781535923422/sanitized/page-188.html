<p>over death (Mark 5:35–43). Exorcisms would not entirely overlap with dis-</p>
<p>cerning of spirits. e latter’s placement between prophecy and tongues may </p>
<p>be due to its primary role of determining whether prophetic and spiritual </p>
<p>utterances truly originate from God’s Spirit (cf. 14:29). is is apparently dis-</p>

<p>righteous lifestyle of the prophet (Matt 7:14–21), his or her predictive accu-</p>

<p>and whether an utterance complements or contradicts apostolic teachings </p>
<p>and traditions (15:1–4; cf. Gal 1:6–9), were doubtless among early criteria. </p>
<p>God’s Spirit must be discerned and distinguished from the prophet’s human </p>
<p>spirit and demonic spirits (1 ess 5:19–21; 1 Tim 4:1; 1<span class="ls2a wsce"> John </span>4<span class="_ _0" />:1<span class="ls2a ws66">, <span class="_ _0" /><span class="ls1 ws0">6<span class="ls2a wsce">). i<span class="_ _0" />s gi </span></span></span></p>

<p>of demons being present in idol precincts (10:21–22).</p>
<p>Prophecy may involve predicting the future (Acts 11:27–28; 21:10–</p>
<p>11), but more centrally it is “the proclamation of a revelation imparted by </p>
<p>God, not by human wisdom.”</p>

<p>Tongu es, or</p>
<p>glossolalia, is the “ability to speak some kind of language unknown to the </p>
<p>sp ea k er.”</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>Paul mentions various kinds of tongues, which suggests there is</p>
<p>more than one species of Spirit-led voices. Hence, we do not need to decide </p>
<p>here between tongues as a human foreign language, a language similar to </p>
<p>but not the same as a foreign language, a sub- or non-linguistic utterance, or </p>
<p>heavenly languages of angels.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>Nevertheless, more than mere aptitude for</p>
<p>speaking foreign languages known to the speaker is meant here given that </p>
<p>tongues is in a list of miraculous gis endowed by God’s Spirit. Dale Martin </p>
<p>may be right that for the ancient world of Corinth, speaking in tongues im-</p>
<p>plied high status since it was assumed to be the language of angels and gods </p>
<p>(T. Job 48–50; Dio Chrysostom Or. 11.22).</p>
<p>124</p>
<p> If so, then perhaps status-seek-</p>
<p>ing congregants interpreted the gi this way and excelled in it, which may </p>
<p>be one reason why Paul encourages prophesy over tongues (1 Cor 14). He </p>
<p>promotes that the Spirit distributes gis as the Spirit sees t, which among </p>

<p>automatically relegated to either human or heavenly intelligent languages (Acts 2:5–12; </p>
<p>1 Cor 13:1), as the spiritual groaning in Rom 8:26 exemplies.</p>
