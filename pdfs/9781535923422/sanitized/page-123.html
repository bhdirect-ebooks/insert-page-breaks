<p>faith.”</p>
<p>160</p>
<p>But what are those imperatives given that Paul sometimes uses a</p>
<p>commanding voice even when giving his own opinion about matters, as in </p>
<p>this chapter? It seems that some of his own imperatives may be regarded </p>
<p>as God’s when they are given by the Lord’s authority (7:10; 14:37; similarly, </p>
<p>Acts 15:22–29). Also, God’s commands may be considered synonymous </p>
<p>with precepts taught as “the law of Christ” (9:21; Gal 6:2). ese are Jesus’s </p>
<p>teachings, some of which are Torah teachings as interpreted by and fullled </p>
<p>through Jesus (Matt 7:12; 22:33–37; Mark 12:28–34; Luke 10:25–28). Paul </p>
<p>acknowledges such commands—e.g., loving the one true God (8:1–6) and </p>
<p>loving one’s neighbor as oneself (Gal 5:14; Rom 13:7–10; cf. 1 Cor 13).</p>
<p>Paul then addresses those in the congregation who were called being a </p>
<p>slave and charges them, do not let it trouble you (7:21). Such words would </p>
<p>be comforting to enslaved auditors who might have feared that involuntary </p>
<p>sex with their masters somehow displeased God as though the fault were </p>
<p>their own. Paul seems to recognize that slaves are responsible only for ac-</p>
<p>tions in which they have control.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p> Apart from concerns about their mas-</p>
<p>ters who might abuse, beat, or otherwise hurt them, Paul arms that they </p>
<p>should not feel unworthy before fellow believers on account of their status—</p>
<p>they, too, are loved and important to God and can contribute to the life of </p>
<p>the congregation. But if they are able to become free, they should make </p>
<p>use all the more (μᾶλλον χρῆσαι). e latter statement is not self-evident </p>
<p>regarding what the slaves are to make use of—should they take advantage </p>
<p>of their slavery or their freedom from slavery?</p>
<p>162</p>
<p> If Paul were encourag-</p>
<p>ing slaves to remain slaves and take advantage of this status, this seems to </p>
<p>conict with his charge to the free congregants not to sell themselves into </p>
<p>slavery (7:23). Since freedom is better than slavery for those who are free, </p>
<p>it also would seem to be for those who are enslaved. We could surmise that </p>
<p>Paul thought it preferable for a slave to gain his freedom than remain a slave. </p>
<p>If freed, he would be able to care for the things of the Lord rather than the </p>
<p>things of the world and how to please his master. A manumitted slave would </p>
<p>be in a far better position than a bound slave for tasks such as Christian ser-</p>
<p>vice, discipleship, evangelism, giving to the poor, and missionary work. Paul </p>
<p>also would be quite aware of slaves’ aspirations for freedom. Both slaves and </p>
<p>freed persons in the congregation probably knew that Corinth was partly </p>
<p>founded on manumitted slaves, and many of its current residents enjoyed </p>
<p>that status.</p>
