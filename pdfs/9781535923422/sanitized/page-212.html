<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>

<p>an editor attempting to improve Paul’s style or alter his words.</p>
<p>247</p>
<p>When we</p>
<p>combine Wire’s study with evidence that longer NT text displacements are </p>
<p>normally authentic, and that the authentic text is widely witnessed geo-</p>
<p>graphically, and that no ancient manuscript omits these verses, this warrants </p>
<p>skepticism regarding an interpolation here.</p>
<p>248</p>
<p>We are best served explaining</p>
<p>the apparent discrepancy another way.</p>
<p>249</p>
<p> Armin Baum studies relevant Gre-</p>
<p>co-Roman and Jewish sources and suggests that, similar to the sentiments </p>
<p>of that time, the principle behind both 11:5 and 14:34–35 “was that female </p>
<p>public speaking without male consent is unacceptable whereas female </p>
<p>public speaking with male consent is unobjectionable.”</p>
<p>250</p>
<p>Indeed, though</p>
diverse attitudes regarding women in public are evident,
<p>251</p>
<p> Paul’s patriar-</p>
<p>chal world is generally unfavorable toward women speaking in public, and </p>
<p>cultural assumptions include women being subject to their husbands and </p>
<p>speaking through them (Plutarch Conj. praec. 142C–E; Livy Hist. 34.1.5; </p>
<p>Aristotle Oec. 3.A–C[1–135]; Euripides Suppl. 40–41).</p>
<p>252</p>
<p>But as we noticed</p>
<p>earlier, the issue in 11:2–16 does not center on male consent but gender </p>
<p>distinction, and in 14:34–35 I hope to demonstrate that Paul’s command for </p>
<p>women again is not based primarily on male consent. Together these pas-</p>
<p>sages may even assume that wives and other females could speak publicly in </p>
<p>worship gatherings if they are gied and inspired by God’s Spirit to do so.</p>
<p>My rendering of 14:34, Let the wives in your assemblies be silent, </p>
<p>for they are not permitted to be talking but to be in submission, just as </p>
<p>the law says also, understands women as wives (γυναῖκες) as the context </p>
<p>claries. e plural “assemblies” probably does not refer to churches univer-</p>
<p>sally but the various houses and facilities where the Corinthians gather for </p>
<p>worship. Paul’s use of λαλέω in this verse is better understood as “talking” </p>
<p>or even “chatting” instead of “speaking.”</p>
<p>253</p>
<p>A prominent key to this word</p>
<p>choice comes from 14:35a—if the wives wish to learn anything, let them </p>
<p>247. Wire 1990:151; cf. 149–52. Haplography may account for the displacement: </p>
<p>the copyist’s eye might have skipped from “churches” in 14:33 to “churches” found in </p>
<p>Western versions of 14:35. See also Niccum 1997:242–55; Miller 2003:217–36; Garland </p>
<p>2003:675–77.</p>
<p>248. See Ross 1992:153–56; Niccum 1997:253–55.</p>
<p>249. Are the words in 14:34–35 the Corinthians’ own words that are rejected in </p>
<p>14:36 (e.g., Janzen 2013:55–70)? Such a slogan would be too long and it is not evident </p>
<p>that 14:36 rejects 14:34–35 (Ciampa/Rosner 2010:719–20).</p>
