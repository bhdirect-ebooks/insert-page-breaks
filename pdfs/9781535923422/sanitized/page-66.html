<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>being both God and Christ, or perhaps God-in-Christ, seems to present the </p>
<p>mind of God and the mind of Christ almost interchangeably. To be sure, the </p>
<p>word “mind” indirectly exhorts the Corinthians to be of the same “mind” </p>
<p>in unity with the mind of Christ (1:10, 13), but Paul is stressing a revelatory </p>
<p>understanding of this mind based on Isaiah.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>is notion of Spirit-lled</p>
believers in Christ knowing divine thoughts sounds like boasting, and in
<p>one sense it is—they are rightly boasting “in the Lord” who grants them </p>
<p>salvation and spiritual gis (1:30–31). If having the mind of Christ seems </p>
<p>to promote a privileged status, we should remember that Paul’s Christ was </p>
<p>crucied, and as such this knowledge serves to criticize all privilege related </p>
<p>to boasting, quarrelling, arrogance, and self-directed elitist wisdom.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>Nurturing Babies in Christ (3:1–4)</p>
<p>Paul continues in the same mode of discourse but now directly addresses </p>
<p>the Corinthians’ shortcoming related to spiritual wisdom: And I, brothers </p>
<p>and sisters, could not speak to you as spiritual but as eshly people, as </p>
<p>babies in Christ. Such language elicits pathos; emotions are aroused by the </p>
<p>use of familial language and shame with the aim of dissuading the auditors </p>
from divisive behavior. is is reinforced by rhetorical questions in 3:3–4
<p>that prompt them to admit their eshly behavior. e Corinthians are still </p>
babies rather than mature adults who can digest divine wisdom. ey need
<p>to be fed milk, not solid food. is metaphoric consumption relates to </p>
<p>learning elementary teachings (cf. Epictetus Diatr. 2.16.26–37; Philo Congr. </p>
<p>18–19; Heb 5:12–14).</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>Paul has to take on the role of a nurse and feed</p>
<p>them again the basics of spiritual training.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>is does not mean, however,</p>
<p>that they should move on from the message of the cross to more “mature” </p>
<p>teachings.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>eir problem is more ethical than intellectual. ey do not</p>
<p>properly comprehend what Christ crucied means for their behavior. e </p>
<p>message of Christ crucied must always remain their foundation (3:11), and </p>
<p>any further wisdom and ethics they might learn should be in conformity </p>
<p>to that message. But instead of emulating humility and power in weakness, </p>
<p>96. Rightly, Lambrecht 2007:440. Dierently, the moral-exhortative sense is </p>
<p>stressed by Strüder 2005; Petersen 2013:77–79. </p>
<p>97. Hays 1997:47; Schrage 1991:1.267.</p>
<p>98. Cf. Dutch 2005:251; Gaventa 1996:104 –5.</p>
<p>99. On ancient men in this role, see Bradley 1991:37–75; Dutch 2005:250.</p>
<p>100. If God’s wisdom is in Christ (1:30), there is little distinction here between milk </p>
<p>and “meat” (Hooker 1966:21). </p>
