<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>

<p>Moses’s prophetic authority comes closer to what Paul means (Num 12:1–</p>
<p>15).</p>
<p>264</p>
<p>Paul alluded to this story earlier (see 13:12), and if it is echoed here,</p>
<p>then reverence to the prophet seems required of both genders. Elsewhere </p>
<p>in Scripture the notion of silence is encouraged when hearing wise counsel </p>
<p>(Job 29:21), and is also given in respect for those in authority (Judg 3:19).</p>
<p>265</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Silence and reverence likewise are to be given to God (Hab 2:20; Zeph 1:7; </p>
<p>Zech 2:13).</p>
<p>266</p>
<p> Commenting on worship in Habakkuk’s context, O. P. Rob-</p>
<p>ertson writes, “One should wait upon him [God] in the awed silence that is </p>
<p>oen the most appropriate expression of true worship.”</p>
<p>267</p>
<p>Marvin Sweeney</p>
<p>arms that Zeph 1:7 “constitutes the prophet’s exclamatory demand for </p>
<p>silence at the beginning of the presentation of yhwh’s oracular statements </p>
<p>that announce the coming Day of yhwh.”</p>
<p>268</p>
<p> It seems to be standard pro-</p>
<p>tocol, then, that in the Scriptures which inform Paul, silence is required </p>
whenever a prophet speaks divine words. is idea is what Paul probably
<p>means by referring to Scripture. In Acts, Peter and Paul’s motioning of the </p>
<p>hand to silence their audiences assumes both commotion among their audi-</p>
<p>tors and the necessity to be quiet as they speak (Acts 12:17; 21:40). Like-</p>
<p>wise in Qumran, talking during the discourse is forbidden (1QS 6.10–13).</p>
<p>269</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Such texts evince that ancient audiences could be quite noisy. Men as well </p>
<p>as women might be guilty of disrupting the speaker, and so we surmise that </p>
<p>the only reason Paul does not silence men or husbands from chatting in the </p>
<p>Corinthian setting is because they were not the problem.</p>
<p>270</p>
<p>e additional phrase, for it is shameful for a wife to talk in church, </p>
<p>equates this activity with what is unacceptable and dishonoring. It would </p>
<p>surely be shameful according to cultural norms of the time for a wife to talk </p>
<p>in a way that embarrassed her husband publicly.</p>
<p>271</p>
<p> Again, this was happen-</p>
<p>ing not necessarily because wives challenged their husbands as speakers, but </p>
<p>because they were asking questions to their husbands about other speak-</p>
<p>ers and interrupting or distracting those speakers and the ones who heard </p>
<p>them. Plutarch considers it rude and disrespectful when audiences interrupt </p>
<p>the lecturer or ask uneducated or irrelevant questions (Rect. rat. aud. 39C; </p>
