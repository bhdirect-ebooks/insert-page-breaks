<p>a result of their own achievements. Every good thing they have is a gi from </p>
<p>God (cf. Ps 85[84]:12; Jas 1:17; Philo Post. 80)</p>
<p>ese questions are followed by three grandiose exclamations: Al-</p>
<p>ready you have been satiated! Already you have become rich! Already </p>
<p>you have become kings without us! Paul’s irony criticizes the Corinthians’ </p>
<p>pued up attitude by imagining them as smug, wealthy rulers of this world </p>
<p>whose high and loy position contrasts lowly lives like Paul and other </p>
<p>apostles.</p>
<p>181</p>
<p>ese words may reect sophist boastings (Philo Det. 33 –35)</p>
<p>or perceptions that characterize hubris among the arrogant (Aristotle Rhet. </p>
<p>2.2.5–6; Herodotus Hist. 3.80).</p>
<p>182</p>
<p> Another possibility is that the Corinthi-</p>
<p>ans are inuenced by Stoic notions of wise persons as wealthy kings.</p>
<p>183</p>
<p>Paul</p>
<p>may have conversed with similar philosophers (e.g., Acts 17:18, 34), and if </p>
<p>so, he knows that such things are said of them.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p>He thus uses this language</p>
<p>of wisdom eectively to deate the arrogant Corinthians. We should stress, </p>
<p>in any case, that Paul’s overstatements make the Corinthians’ status to be </p>
<p>something “other than it really is.”</p>
<p>185</p>
<p>With their new make-believe status intact, the Corinthians are now </p>
<p>prompted to envision the end of a triumphal procession or an arena spec-</p>
<p>tacle or both (4:9–10).</p>
<p>186</p>
<p>e apostles are apparent captives of war in which</p>
<p>God has exhibited them last, as the nal public spectacle. If a procession </p>
<p>is imagined,</p>
<p>187</p>
<p>the very end of the celebration is in view when execution is</p>
<p>determined for the captives at the Roman temple, Jupiter Capitolinus. e </p>
<p>apostles are as those condemned to death.</p>
<p>188</p>
<p>e captives may be slain or</p>
<p>sacriced on the spot,</p>
<p>189</p>
<p>or they might be condemned to die at a later point</p>
<p>in the arena. Henry Nguyen makes a case for the spectacle portraying arena </p>
<p>181. On Apollos as an apostle, see Wilson 2013:325–35</p>
<p>182. See respectively, Winter 2002:198; Marshall 1987:205–6.</p>

<p>1058B– C; Paige 2004:211–14; Pogolo 1992:115–17. Unlike iselton 1978:510–26 </p>
<p>and my earlier Oropeza 2002a:88–90; 2007:180–82, I now think it less likely that real-</p>
<p>ized eschatology is in view.</p>
<p>184. E.g., Plato Rep. 5.473C–D; Epictetus Diatr. 3.22.49; Musonius Rufus Lect. 8.</p>
<p>185. Planck 1987:39 cf. 48, denes this type of irony as dissimulation.</p>
<p>186. Josephus Bell. 7.131, portrays Vespasian’s procession through Roman theatres </p>
<p>to make it widely visible.</p>
<p>187. As BDAG 108 claims of ἀποδείκνυμι, though if captives are last in the sense </p>
<p>of parading order, this is not typical of Roman triumphs (cf. Plutarch Aemil. Paul. </p>
<p>32.2—34.4; Appian Pun. 9.66; Mith. 17.116 –17).</p>
<p>188. e sentence of death, ἐπιθανατίους, is rare; e.g., in the Septuagint it appears </p>
<p>only once in reference to those thrown to the lions (Bel 31). is term weakens the idea </p>
<p>that the fool of mime theatre is in view (cf. Adams 2008:111–30, pace Welborn 2005).</p>
<p>189. See Versnel 1970:58 –63, 83–87; Hafemann 2000:105.</p>
