<p>directly God or Christ or both. is phrase alludes to Moses knowing God </p>
<p>face to face (Exod 33:11; Deut 32:10). In Num 12:6–8, from which Paul’s </p>
<p>word “riddle” seems developed, God speaks to Moses “mouth to mouth” </p>
and not in riddles. He receives direct words from the divine Presence in
<p>the cloud, and not in dreams and visions as do other prophets. Moses is </p>
<p>also able to see the very “glory” of the Lord. Later Jewish debates try to </p>
<p>distinguish how Moses had clearer access to God than the prophets. For </p>
<p>instance, Rabbi Judah bar Ilai, using Num 12:8 as one of his texts, believes </p>
<p>the prophets saw God though nine mirrors but Moses only through one </p>
<p>(Lev. Rab. 1:14). Other sages suggested the prophets saw God in a blurry or </p>
<p>tarnished mirror whereas Moses saw God through a clear or polished one.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In the age to come, however, all esh will see the glory of the Lord (Isa 40:5). </p>
<p>Paul may have known similar interpretations in his own day.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p>For him the</p>
<p>mirror’s image in 13:12 is not one’s own face but the face of God, though </p>
<p>known indirectly as from spiritual speech gis. Believers perceive that face </p>
<p>and glory only partially and indirectly. When the future culmination of all </p>
<p>things takes place, the glorious image of God in Christ will be seen directly. </p>
<p>en Paul (along with the faithful) will know the Lord face to face and fully </p>
<p>know just as also I am known by the Lord (cf. 2 Cor 3:18; 4:6, 14; 1 John </p>
<p>3:2; Rev 22:4). e second coming of Christ, then, is that time when full </p>
<p>knowledge, revelation, and recognition of God in Christ reaches its comple-</p>
<p>tion. Partial recognition, characterized by the gis of tongues, prophecy, </p>
<p>and knowledge, will then become obsolete.</p>
<p>Until then, faith, hope, and love remain prominent in the present </p>
<p>age. is triad presents an alternative to the triad of tongues, prophecy, and </p>
<p>knowledge.</p>
<p>183</p>
<p>Paul perhaps selected these virtues since they identify well</p>
<p>what it is to be in Christ.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p>ey also have special relevance to enduring</p>
<p>aiction (1 ess 1:3–8; 5:8; Rom 5:1–5). If we can repeat Horsley’s per-</p>
<p>ceptive ideas, faith inaugurates and enables the new life in Christ in the </p>
<p>present age; hope enables those in Christ to endure problems of this age; </p>
<p>and love holds together those in Christ as a community “in anticipation of </p>
<p>the completion of God’s fulllment . . . into the kingdom.”</p>
<p>185</p>
<p>In the age to</p>
<p>come Paul implies that faith and hope will be set aside since recognizing </p>
<p>God face to face will replace belief in what is not seen (2 Cor 5:7), and with </p>

<p>important than “gis of the Spirit.”</p>
