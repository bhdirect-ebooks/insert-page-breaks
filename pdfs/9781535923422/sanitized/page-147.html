<p>since he is motivated to preach in order to save himself.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p> Hence, partner-</p>
<p>ship here probably means, or at least includes, the work of proclaiming the </p>
<p>gospel. Paul modestly suggests to being a fellow partner, presumably with </p>
<p>God and Christ, in advancing the good news (cf. 2 Cor 5:19–20).</p>
<p>Competition and Self-Control (9:24–27)</p>
<p>Although Paul’s calling is still the subject of this chapter’s ending, 9:24–27 </p>
<p>looks both ways, sharing virtually as much with the previous text as with </p>
<p>the subsequent.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p> All three pericopae are concerned about gaining salva-</p>
<p>tion and exercising self-control to get there, whether by abandonment of </p>
<p>rights (ch. 9) or abandonment of vices (ch. 10). In this transitory text Paul </p>
<p>presents athletic imagery through the language of contest (known as agon </p>
<p>discourse) in which one must exert self-control to win, whether in a foot-</p>
<p>race or boxing match.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>e scene is perhaps colored by Paul witnessing the</p>
<p>famous Isthmian games near Corinth (51 CE), which took place every two </p>
<p>years and rivaled Olympic and other panhellenic games.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>Paul may have</p>
<p>produced tents to shelter visiting athletes, though his own familiarity with </p>
<p>sports games probably goes back to his boyhood in Tarsus.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>e opening question, Do you not know that those who run in a </p>
<p>stadium race all run but one receives the prize? assumes an armative </p>
<p>answer. is prompts the following imperative, so run that you may obtain </p>
<p>it! is metaphor of running a footrace has an apocalyptic goal in which </p>
<p>Corinthians of this present age win the prize of nal salvation in the coming </p>
<p>age. e race is also relevant for Paul whose calling is bound up with nal </p>
<p>salvation (9:16, 27; cf. Phil 3:11–14),</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>and it includes all believers, both</p>
<p>men and women.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>at only one person wins the prize is consistent with</p>
<p>79. Hooker 1996:85; Garland 2003:436.</p>
<p>80. Emphasizing its relation with ch. 9 is Carter 2010:156–58; with ch. 10 is Sumney </p>
<p>2000:329–33.</p>
<p>81. Alternatively for the latter, pankration, a sport that combined boxing and wres-</p>
<p>tling, may be imagined. </p>
<p>82. See Brändl 2006:186–244. Paul’s agonistic discourse likewise may be inuenced </p>
<p>by Jewish traditions (e.g., Wis 4:2; 10:10–12; Sir 4:28; Brändl 2006:76–137, 412).</p>
