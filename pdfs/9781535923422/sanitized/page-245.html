<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>
<p>221</p>
<p>to eodotion or Aquila that include νῖκος.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>Otherwise, it is possible that</p>
<p>he reads “forever” (חצנל) not in its earlier temporal sense but in its later </p>
<p>Aramaic sense in which the root חצנ conveys the idea of conquering or </p>
<p>being victorious.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p> All the same, Isaiah’s context is suitably set in apoca-</p>
lyptic anticipation of divine judgement on heavenly and earthly forces (Isa
<p>24:20–21).</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>At that time Gentile nations will worship and pay homage</p>
<p>to the Lord in Zion, and the people who trust in the Lord are saved and </p>
<p>protected (25:9; 26:3–4). Although dead enemies who are trampled un-</p>
<p>derfoot will not rise again, “the dead will rise, and those in the tombs will </p>
<p>be raised” (26:19; cf. 26:20–27:1). e thematic parallels from Isaiah that </p>
<p>inform Paul seem to include the defeat of death, enemies under the feet of </p>
<p>the righteous, images of the resurrected life, and the prophetic fullment of </p>
<p>Gentiles joining God’s people. </p>
<p>A second quote originates from Hos 13:14b: Where, O death, is your </p>
<p>victory? Where, O death, is your goad?</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> Paul seems to be freely recon-</p>
<p>guring the text or citing a version unavailable to us.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>e Septuagint</p>
<p>renders for the rst question, “where is your penalty (δίκη)?” e Hebrew </p>
<p>has “where are your plagues ( ֜ י ֶר ָב ְד )?” before asking Sheol, “where is your </p>
<p>destruction?” Paul’s use of “victory” (νῖκος) seems inuenced by his previ-</p>
<p>ous quote from Isa 25:8, which he now links with Hos 13:14. e quote’s </p>
<p>interpretation is not helped by the Hebrew context of Hos 13 because there </p>
<p>God decides in favor of bringing death to his rebellious people with an </p>
<p>Assyrian invasion on the horizon. is context suggests Hos 13:14a be </p>
<p>rendered as questions: e.g., “Shall I ransom them from the power of Sheol? </p>
<p>Shall I redeem them from death?” (NASB), to which the questions in 13:14b </p>
<p>have God bringing on death rather than preventing it (contra NIV, NKJV). </p>
<p>e Septuagint at 13:14a, however, might be read as statements rather than </p>
<p>questions, as Hays translates it: “I will deliver them from the hand of Ha-</p>
<p>des, and will redeem them from Death.”</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>If Paul understood the verse this</p>
<p>114. Also, like Paul, the passive voice is used for “swallow” in Symmachus (though </p>
<p>without νῖκος). See variants in Heil 2005:248–49.</p>
<p>115. Contrast the Hebrew meaning for חצנ in BDB and Aramaic in CAL, ad. loc. </p>
<p>(though the latter is a verb; the Aramaic noun form is ןחצנ). Boer 1988:127, fuses the </p>
<p>two senses by suggesting the victory is a permanent one.</p>
<p>116. e idea of death being swallowed up reverses the role of Sheol (Hades), which </p>
<p>enlarges itself to swallow up the dead (Isa 5:14).</p>
<p>117. Unlike Hosea, Paul moves his “your” (σου) in front of the vocative “death” </p>
<p>(θάνατε) so as to stress the possessive pronoun and make the taunt more vivid (cf. Heil </p>
<p>2005:250).</p>
