<p>When Paris abducts Helen, this ignites the entire tragedy of the</p>
<p>Trojan War. As anyone in the ancient Mediterranean informed by this story </p>
<p>would know, the potential damage that discord might initiate is virtually </p>
<p>immeasurable! Eris now threatened the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Rivalry in this congregation centers on members claiming I am of </p>
<p>Paul, and others, I am of Apollos, and still others, I am of Cephas.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> Vari-</p>
<p>ous attempts have been made to identify these groups.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Some important</p>
<p>observations we suggest are as follows. First, except perhaps for the last </p>
<p>claim, I am of Christ, these allegiances do not appear to be Paul’s inven-</p>
tion of Corinthian divisions.
<p>21</p>
<p>He repeats the rst two claims in 3:4 and the</p>
<p>rst three in 3:22. Had Paul invented these, his repetition would only serve </p>
<p>to irritate the Corinthians who knew their own state of aairs better than </p>
<p>Paul. ey would doubtless contest his repeated claims of these alliances </p>
<p>if they were not true. Second, there is no clear evidence that Paul, Apol-</p>
<p>los, or Cephas instigated or encouraged these allegiances. e Corinthians </p>
<p>probably instigated this rivalry themselves, which stems from their lack of </p>
<p>maturity as well as worldly inuences. ird, this problem does not seem to </p>
<p>involve well-established parties who have drawn their lines in the sand over </p>
<p>distinctive theological positions.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> e congregation members are being vo-</p>
<p>cal about their preferences for one leader over the other, which as chapters </p>
<p>1–4 unfold, has more to do with prestige, persona, and oratory skills than </p>
<p>the doctrines these leaders teach.</p>
<p>Why wouldn’t Paul commend members who respected his apostolic </p>
<p>authority when claiming, I am of Paul? Context reects that they or their </p>
<p>rivals or both expressed their loyalty with strife and derision against other </p>
<p>members who did not share their sentiment. ey may have quarreled with </p>
<p>those who armed, I am of Apollos. e two groups apparently argued </p>
<p>over who was the better minister (3:4–9; 4:1–6). If Acts 18:24—19:1 cor-</p>
<p>rectly portrays Apollos as an eloquent and forceful speaker, his supporters </p>

<p>3 Bar. 8.5. </p>
<p>19. e genitive of relationship in Greek is used in 1:12: “I [am] of,” or more freely, </p>
<p>“I belong to” (3:22–23).</p>

<p>21. If the four slogans are caricatures of Corinthian allegiances (so Mitchell </p>
<p>1991:83–86), the rst three seem real regardless of the precise words congregants might </p>
<p>have used.</p>
