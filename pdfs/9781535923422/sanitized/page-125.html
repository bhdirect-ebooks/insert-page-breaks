<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>101</p>
<p>tential converts to this new spiritual status.</p>
<p>171</p>
<p>His compassion for the latter</p>
<p>is evident with Onesimus, whom he brings to faith and charges his master </p>
<p>Philemon to accept Onesimus “no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, </p>
<p>as a beloved brother” (Phlm 10 cf. 16). He also calls slaves in the Corinthian </p>
<p>congregation “brothers and sisters” (7:24), reversing the social order of his </p>
<p>day by including them in the household of God not as slaves but as persons </p>
<p>and fellow siblings in Christ. ese Paul considers the socially weaker and </p>
<p>less-honored members of the congregation, which are thus considered more </p>
<p>honorable in Christ (12:22–24). As fellow siblings in Christ, they along </p>
<p>with others are not to be wronged or defrauded by congregation members </p>
<p>(6:8), ruined by a stronger person’s liberties (8:12), not to be despised (Rom </p>
<p>14:10), not to be caused to stumble by what another believer does (Rom </p>
<p>14:21), and not to be exploited in matters of sex (1 ess 4:6).</p>
<p>172</p>
<p>Advice Regarding Virgins and Widows (7:25–40)</p>
<p>e phrase now concerning virgins begins Paul’s response to another ques-</p>
<p>tion the Corinthians wrote to him about (see 7:1), or, alternatively, it simply </p>
<p>starts another topic related to domestic relationships. Since Paul assumes </p>
<p>that sex apart from marriage is fornication (7:1–2, 9), he considers virgin-</p>
<p>ity as the norm before marriage, which is typical of Jewish communities </p>
<p>(Deut 22:13–21; Tob 3:14–15; Sir 26:10–12; Sib. Or. 2.279 –81).</p>
<p>173</p>
<p>As in 7:12</p>
<p>our apostle instructs by virtue of his own opinion, as one shown mercy by </p>
<p>the Lord to be trustworthy.</p>
<p>174</p>
<p>His advice is a matter of practical wisdom,</p>
<p>171. Glancy 2002:34–38 argues that Paul does not hold his vision in Gal 3:28 con-</p>
sistently because he reinscribes divisions between slave and free in Gal 4. But her view
<p>misses the rhetorical impact Paul’s words in Gal 4:7 would make on slave auditors. </p>
<p>Such liberating words are characteristic of what would attract slaves to become devote </p>
<p>believers in the rst place.</p>
<p>172. is perspective undermines Glancy 1998:496; 2002:59–65; 2015:227–28, </p>
<p>who insinuates that Paul advocates Christian masters to have sex with their slaves. If </p>
<p>such sex were to provide a second sexual outlet for believers, then Paul’s repeated point </p>
<p>that marital sex is the only alternative to unfullled passion could hardly make any </p>
<p>sense (7:1–2, 5, 9, 37–38). When we add to this Paul’s points that believers should not </p>
<p>take a woman for sexual gratication (7:1), the husband’s body is owned by his wife </p>
<p>(7:4b), Paul’s preference for celibacy (7:7), and his positive view of slaves as persons, </p>
<p>such ideas almost certainly negate that Paul would allow, let alone encourage, masters </p>
<p>to have sex with their slaves. His lack of discussing the matter more explicitly need not </p>
<p>be interpreted as indierence but probably agreement with moralists like Musonius </p>
<p>Rufus: “What need is there to say that it is an act of licentiousness and nothing less for </p>
<p>a master to have relations with a slave? Everyone knows that” (Lect 12).</p>
<p>173. See further examples in Loader 2013:45–46; Harper 2012:363–83.</p>
<p>174. is, then, is an argument from ethos (Collins 1999:289).</p>
