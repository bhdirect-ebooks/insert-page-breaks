<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>

<p>Remaining in One’s Calling (7:17–24)</p>
<p>e opening nevertheless (εἰ μὴ) points back to the “call to peace” in 7:15 </p>
<p>in relation to the dissolution of a believer’s marriage; nevertheless, this cir-</p>
<p>cumstantial “change is not to be the rule” for congregation members.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>rule is normally that as God has called each one, so let that person walk and </p>
<p>remain in that same calling. is idea is repeated in dierent words three </p>
<p>times in chiastic form:</p>
<p>A. Let each believer walk in their God-given assignment and calling </p>
<p>(7:17)</p>
<p>B. Instructions on being called into circumcision and uncircumcision </p>
<p>(7:18–19)</p>
<p>C. Let each believer remain in the calling in which they were called </p>
<p>(7:20)</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>. Instructions on being called into slavery and freedom (7:21–23)</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>. Let each believer remain with God in whatever calling they were </p>
<p>called (7:24)</p>
<p>is repetitive pattern highlights the verbs walk and remain with reference </p>
<p>to one’s calling as important principles not only for Corinthian perception </p>
<p>but for all the churches of Paul’s mission (4:17; 11:16; 14:33). e metaphor </p>
<p>of walking seems derived from Jewish halakah, the notion of “following a </p>
<p>moral pattern for conducting one’s life.”</p>
<p>150</p>
<p> In Paul’s other letters, the be-</p>
<p>liever’s walk is to be holy, pleasing to God, and guided by the Spirit (1 ess </p>
<p>4:1–3; Gal 5:16, 25; Rom 8:4). Doubtless such conduct is expected regardless </p>
<p>of the family, vocation, location, education, and circumstances of life one </p>
<p>nds oneself in when following Christ. We misinterpret Paul, however, if </p>
<p>we make him say that people should never change their respective circum-</p>
<p>stances, especially in relation to their behavior aer conversion. is would </p>
<p>be counterproductive to the radical transformation he promotes in 6:9–11. </p>
<p>e drunkard should be free from his addiction, the swindler should make </p>
<p>an honest living, and the idol maker should alter his career. Paul is also not </p>
<p>prohibiting a change of status.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p>He essentially means, “Do not let the set</p>
<p>of conditions into which you were converted become a source of hindrance </p>
<p>to your relationship and service to the Lord” (cf. 7:32a, 35). e believer is </p>
