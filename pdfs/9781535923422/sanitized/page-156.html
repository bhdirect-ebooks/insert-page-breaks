<p>Fleeing Idolatry and Demons (10:14–22)</p>
<p>e inferential therefore in 10:14 begins a new pericope that opens with </p>
<p>Paul’s command to ee from idolatry. is warning parallels 6:18, though </p>
<p>idolatry replaces fornication as the vice, and a cultic setting is the imagined </p>
<p>location. e strong members are envisioned eating idol food there. Our </p>
<p>apostle appeals to their sensibility to judge for themselves what he says. </p>
<p>He is condent they will agree with him as he amplies the need for this </p>
<p>ight by way of eight questions that prompt the answers he wishes to hear </p>
<p>as he argues by use of example (10:16), application (10:17), analogy (10:18), </p>
<p>contrary (10:19–20), and then a conclusion (10:20–22).</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>e repetitive idea of sharing (κοινωνία) in this passage suggests both </p>
<p>participation and partnership, and may be understood as “communion with </p>
<p>someone by communally partaking in something.”</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>Paul highlights both</p>
<p>fellowship and eating with others inclusive of spiritual entities related to </p>
<p>the dining experience. e Corinthians are to say “yes” to Paul’s questions </p>
<p>related to their sharing the one cup and one bread that connects believers </p>
<p>with the blood (death), redemption, and presence of the body of Christ </p>
<p>through their celebration of the Lord’s Supper (10:16–17; cf. 11:17–34).</p>
<p>134</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e members reconrm their solidarity as the collective body of Christ by </p>
<p>sharing in this meal (cf. 5:6–7; 12:13). e auditors are then prompted to af-</p>
<p>rm this type of sharing again as Paul compares it with Israel according to </p>
<p>the esh (i.e., as an ethnic people: Rom 4:1; 9:3–4; Gal 4:23). e Israelites </p>
<p>eat and participate of cultic oerings at the altar of sacrice in Jerusalem’s </p>
<p>temple (10:18; cf. 9:13). ey eat in the Lord’s presence and have a relation-</p>
<p>ship both with the Lord and with those at the altar (Exod 18:12; 29:11–23; </p>
<p>Lev 3:12—4:24; Deut 12:5–18; 14:23–26). Communion at the altar thus </p>
<p>has horizontal (with other humans) and vertical (with God) dimensions.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Israel’s covenant with God was also conrmed by God being present and </p>
<p>eating with members of the covenant (Exod 24:1–11). What is pictured by </p>
<p>Israel’s cultic eating, similar to the Lord’s Supper, is that worshipers enjoy </p>
<p>mutual fellowship and eat together with the Lord being present. is activ-</p>
<p>ity marks an ongoing reconrmation of their covenant relationship.</p>
<p>132. See Eriksson 1998:167–68.</p>
<p>133. Tilling 2012:97. is meaning perhaps arises from Hellenistic-cultic use (see </p>
<p>Gäckle 2005:267). “Sharer” (κοινωνός: 10:18, 20) has a similar nuance, and to “share” </p>
<p>(μετέχω: 10:17, 21), may emphasize partaking and participating.</p>
<p>134. “Cup of blessing” may be adopted from the third cup of Passover meals, the </p>
<p>cup of redemption (m.Pes. 10.7). </p>
<p>135. Stressing the former, Woyke 2005:245–47, stressing the latter, Tilling </p>
<p>2012:97–99. </p>
