<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>78</p>
<p>from God’s kingdom might happen to them (10:1–12; cf. Gal 5:19–20). In </p>
<p>6:9–10 exclusion from the kingdom forms an inclusio with ten vices in be-</p>
<p>tween, possibly hinting at the Ten Commandments, though not duplicating </p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>Although vice lists are common in both Jewish and Greco-Roman</p>
<p>moral traditions,</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>the former reect Paul’s list better since destruction and</p>
<p>exclusion from God result from vice-doing (1QS 4.9–14; 4Q257 V.7–13; </p>
<p>Philo Virt. 182; T.Jac. 7.19–20; cf. Rev 21:8; 22:15). Early Jesus sayings add </p>
<p>more specically that exclusion is from God’s kingdom (Matt 5:20; 7:21–23; </p>
<p>8:11–12; 13:41–42; 25:34–46; John 3:3–5).</p>
<p>Paul’s list includes vices the Corinthians commit. ese include the </p>
<p>practices of fornicators (5:1; 6:18; 10:8), idolaters (10:7, <span class="_ _0" />16<span class="ws172">–</span>22<span class="ws14d">; cf. Col </span>3:5),</p>
<p>greedy persons (6:1–8; 2 Cor 9:5; cf. Eph 5:5), drunkards (11:21; cf. Gal </p>
<p>5:21), swindlers (5:10–11; cf. Luke 18:11), and revilers (5:11; cf. Sir 23:8). </p>
<p>Vices on this list reect pre-converted behaviors, and Paul expects better </p>
<p>things of his converts. Adultery is relevant to the Corinthian situation if </p>
<p>one surmises that some of the congregants having sex with prostitutes in </p>
<p>6:12–20 are married.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>But it is not necessary for us to connect every vice on</p>
<p>this list with a current problem in their church; these vice-doers represent </p>
<p>what the congregants used to be prior to conversion (6:11). Some once were </p>
<p>idolaters, adulterers, swindlers, revilers, thieves (1 Pet 4:15; John 10:10), </p>
<p>and passive and dominant same-sex erotic partners.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>But such vices were washed away when the Corinthians accepted the </p>
<p>gospel, confessed Christ at baptism (Acts 22:16; Rom 10:9–10), and were </p>
<p>consecrated as saints (cf. 1:2) and justied by faith. ey were set in right </p>
<p>standing with God by the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the </p>
<p>Spirit of our God who lled them at their conversion-initiation and con-</p>
<p>tinues to transform them (Gal 2:16; Rom 3:24, 26; cf. 1 Cor 12:13). e </p>
<p>Holy Spirit dwells in and among them, sanctifying and empowering them </p>
<p>to resist these vices and produce virtuous characteristics instead (cf. Gal </p>
<p>5:22 –23; Rom 8:1–16). is review of their conversion reinforces the Cor-</p>
<p>inthians to identify themselves not with the way they formerly lived when </p>
<p>practicing unrighteousness, but as they are supposed to be currently liv-</p>
<p>ing—as a righteous and holy community in Christ.</p>
