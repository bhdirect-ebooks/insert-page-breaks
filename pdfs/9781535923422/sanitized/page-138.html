<p>ers and sisters in Christ than their right to eat idol meats. Cicero’s unity </p>
for the political body is relevant for the body of Christ: “if the individual
<p>appropriates to selsh ends what should be devoted to the common good, </p>
<p>all human fellowship will be destroyed” (O. 3.6.26).</p>
<p>Paul’s Release of Apostolic Rights (9:1–18)</p>
<p>Prompted by the charge he just made for strong members to relinquish their </p>
<p>rights for the weak members’ sake, Paul now expands on what it means </p>
<p>for an apostle like himself who has freedom and entitlements to relinquish </p>
<p>his rights for the sake of the gospel. Although he includes forensic words </p>
<p>of self-defense (9:3), he primarily continues using deliberative rhetoric by </p>
<p>providing proof by example.</p>

<p>Four introductory questions in 9:1 and three</p>
<p>more in 9:4–6 all expect the answer “yes.” en three analogical questions </p>
<p>in 9:7 expect the answer “no one.” Six more questions follow that relate to </p>
<p>a citation from Scripture and maxim (9:8–12a). Paul’s answer formulates a </p>
<p>chiastic pattern with pathos (9:12b–18). is collage of rhetorical questions </p>
<p>makes Paul’s arguments persuasive by eliciting his auditors to agree with his </p>
<p>statements, anticipate objections, and summarily dismiss them.</p>

<p>e initial questions our apostle poses may reect diatribe that assume </p>
<p>hypothetical interlocutors who ask Paul regarding 8:13, “What argumenta-</p>
<p>tive proofs could you show us that we should follow your example of re-</p>
<p>fraining from idol food for the sake of others?” To which he responds, Am </p>
<p>I not free? Am I not an apostle? ese questions function thematically for </p>
<p>this chapter. e rst converges with Paul’s apostolic rights, in particular his </p>
<p>freedom to eat what he pleases (9:4). Rhetorically, he rst establishes what </p>
<p>is acceptable with his auditors before altering their perception of permis-</p>
<p>sibility. e second question should be self-evident to the Corinthians; they </p>
know that Paul was divinely sent to proclaim the gospel since his message
<p>led to their transformation. His apostolic calling is conrmed by his next </p>
<p>two questions, Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in </p>
<p>the Lord? e rst assumes that being an eyewitness of the risen Lord is </p>
<p>relevant criterion for being an apostle (cf. 15:5–8).</p>

<p>Although Paul was not</p>
<p>an original disciple who had seen and heard Jesus before the crucixion, he </p>
<p>considers his Damascus encounter with Jesus to be a valid substitute for this </p>
