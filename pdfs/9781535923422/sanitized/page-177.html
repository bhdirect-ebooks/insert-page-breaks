<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>e problem in Corinth centers on certain members bringing and </p>
<p>consuming larger portions of food and drink than poor members.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>Paul</p>
<p>addresses the problem to the entire church as it comes together, which sug-</p>
<p>gests that quite a few members were in the “have” category and causing this </p>
<p>problem for those who “have not.”</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>Some have imagined this gathering</p>
<p>at a villa-styled home with a triclinium room that seated nine to twelve </p>
<p>honored guests, set apart from the atrium and other areas in which less </p>
<p>prominent and poorer members ate.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>e best positioned members would</p>
<p>eat the best portions. e meaning of προλαμβάνω in 11:21 as “take be-</p>
<p>forehand” (“eat . . . without waiting for anybody else” NIV) complements </p>
<p>this view with the inference that slaves and poorer members arrived at the </p>
<p>dining house later, presumably because these had to work long hours. By </p>
<p>the time they arrived, and since they had no place in the triclinium, little or </p>
<p>no food remained for them (see also 11:33 below). David Horrell, however, </p>
<p>aptly challenges the triclinium setting as lacking clear and correctly timed </p>
<p>archaeological evidence from Corinth, opting instead for the supper taking </p>
<p>place in a workshop building with an upper room akin with discoveries </p>
<p>east of the Corinthian theatre.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>Dierently, David Balch, noticing that</p>
<p>members sat rather than reclined (14:30), suggests inter alia from Roman </p>
<p>domestic art their gathering at a peristyle garden or tavern with benches </p>
<p>for seating.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>A poor member’s location at the gathering, then, may have</p>
<p>been right next to a more well-to-do member. Moreover, with this view, </p>
<p>the term προλαμβάνω does not mean to “take beforehand,” but to “take” </p>
<p>the food in the sense of intense consumption so that each one devours his </p>
<p>own supper “without sharing with others” (NLT). is meaning suggests </p>
<p>that since the wealthier members bring bigger and better portions of food </p>
<p>with them than the meager amounts (if any) that the poor might bring, the </p>
<p>latter remain hungry at the meal while they haplessly look at the well-to-do </p>
<p>members consuming sumptuous foods and wine. is problem is taking </p>
<p>place during the eating (ἐν τῷ φαγεῖν) with the poor being present at the </p>
<p>meal; they are not arriving late.</p>

<p>66. is suggests that the wide-scale poverty of members posited by Meggitt </p>
<p>1998:120 and Friesen 2005:351–70 is overdrawn. See Introduction.</p>
<p>67. E.g., Murphy-O’Connor 1983:153–61. Gaius’s home is sometimes proposed </p>
<p>(Rom 16:23). Pompeii trinclinia tted only six to nine persons (Perkins 2012:142), </p>
<p>whereas in Pergamon an association for Dionysiac “cowherds” had two that together </p>
<p>tted up to seventy (Ascough 2012a:24; Ascough/Harland/Kloppenborg 2012b:B6).</p>
