<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>77</p>
<p>follows. First, Paul arms through irony that they could arbitrate such mat-</p>
<p>ters for themselves. Since they are disputing over lesser matters, he poses a </p>
<p>somewhat facetious question to the eect that they could appoint as arbitra-</p>
<p>tors those who are of least importance in the church, since even these </p>
individuals would be competent enough to handle trivial cases. He then
<p>poses another question with the expectation that they should select a wise </p>
<p>member among them who will be able to judge between fellow believers. </p>
<p>Given their propensity to boast about wisdom, we detect a hint of sarcasm. </p>
<p>ey consider the wise to be someone schooled in declamation, the prac-</p>
<p>tice of rhetorical speeches (see chs. 1–2). A prominent type of declaiming </p>
<p>included contraversiae (legal case studies), which oen centered on frater-</p>
<p>nal disputes.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>It is as though Paul were saying, “You who are so prone to</p>
<p>eloquent and clever words, how is it that you cannot nd anyone among </p>
<p>yourselves with enough declamation skills to judge such matters?” is he </p>
<p>says to shame them regarding how they are currently handling the matter. </p>
<p>Second, Paul advises them to endure being wronged and defrauded rather </p>
<p>than have their reputation tarnished before unbelievers.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>is solution may</p>
<p>be somewhat reminiscent of Jesus who taught that if someone takes you </p>
<p>to court and takes away your tunic, give them your cloak also (Matt 5:40). </p>
<p>In essence doing wrongly is worse than suering wrongly (cf. Plato Gorg. </p>
<p>509C; Philo Jos. 4.20).</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul also anticipates negative outcomes in this situation. Regardless of </p>
<p>how the litigations might transpire in court, the result is an utter defeat for </p>
<p>them all (6:7). ey lose solidarity as a congregation and, among outsiders, </p>
<p>they lose reputation by failing to exemplify Christian love and righteous </p>
<p>conduct (cf. 10:31–32; 1 ess 4:9–12; Rom 2:24).</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To deter the congregation from wrongful and fraudulent conduct in </p>
<p>this regard, Paul poses a question in which they ought to know that the </p>
<p>unjust will not inherit the kingdom of God. e Corinthians are warned, </p>
<p>do not be deceived into thinking there are no consequences for unjust con-</p>
<p>duct in these court cases: vice-doers will have no part in God’s kingdom </p>
<p>but will perish along with all the unrighteous of this present age (cf. 2:6, 8; </p>
<p>3:17). Congregation members are faced with the possibility that exclusion </p>
<p>63. See Peppard 2014:190; Winter 2002:24, 30–33, 118–21. Paul may also be hint-</p>
<p>ing that the genuinely “wise” do not go to court for wrong reasons (cf. Musonius Rufus </p>
<p>Lect. 10; Cicero O. 3.6.28; Robertson 2007:593–94).</p>
<p>64. Since these matters are trivial, Paul could advise this way. Today, if an alleged </p>
<p>“Christian” raped or murdered someone, such things are not trivial and that person </p>
<p>should be brought to justice! </p>
<p>65. Cf. Fitzmyer 2008:254.</p>
<p>66. See Edsall 2013:35–36.</p>
