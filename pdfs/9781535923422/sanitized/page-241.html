<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>
<p>217</p>
<p>2:7 informs the rst sentence,</p>
<p>98</p>
<p> and perhaps Ezek 37:1–14 informs the sec-</p>
<p>ond. Ezekiel’s vision of the valley of dry bones connects God’s Spirit with </p>
<p>giving new life to the dead, and the idea of new life coming about by the </p>
<p>breath or spirit alludes back to God breathing life into Adam in Gen 2:7.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We could surmise that Paul interprets this vision to be anticipating resurrec-</p>
<p>tion, and since it echoes the old creation of Adam, he contrasts this creation </p>
<p>with a new one related to resurrection. Both cases result in bodies being </p>
<p>formed. With this backdrop in place, along with 15:44 and 46 that assume </p>
<p>the respective soulish- and Spirit-animated bodies, we can adduce that both </p>
<p>the rst Adam and last Adam have bodies even though the word “body” </p>
<p>(σῶμα) does not appear in verse 45. Paul’s ellipsis assumes his audience can </p>
<p>readily draw the contextual inference that both Adam (the living soul being) </p>
<p>and the risen Christ (the life-giving Spirit being) have not suddenly lost </p>
<p>their bodies in one verse! e apostle elaborates on what was already said </p>
<p>in 15:22—to be in Adam is to participate in the soulish animated existence </p>
<p>and die; to be in Christ is to participate with the spiritual animated existence </p>
<p>and rise from the dead to new life. God, Christ, and the Spirit all participate </p>
<p>in raising what is dead to new life (2 Cor 3:6; Rom 4:17; 8:11; cf. 1 Tim </p>
<p>6:13; John 5:21; 6:63), so much so that Paul refers to Christ and God’s Spirit </p>
<p>interchangeably not only here but also in 2 Cor 3:17 and Rom 8:9–11. As </p>
<p>the “soul” gives the body its animation and activity in the old creation, in the </p>
<p>resurrection, so Christ as the life-giving Spirit gives the transformed body </p>
<p>life and activity in the new creation.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>More antitheses follow in 15:46–49. Adam, the soulish-animated man </p>
<p>from the dust of the earth came rst, and then the second man came, the </p>
<p>Spirit-animated man, Christ who is from heaven. With the soulish Adam </p>
<p>being rst, Paul revisits the order of salvic and transformative events (cf. </p>
<p>15:20–23), which perhaps suggests that some Corinthians need to be re-</p>
<p>minded about this order. Also, Paul may be stressing distance between the </p>
<p>present and future bodies here.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> e rst Adam represents the rest of hu-</p>
<p>mankind in the present state—mortals who dwell on earth and are perish-</p>
<p>98. Paul adds “rst” (πρῶτος) and possibly “Adam” (Ἀδάμ), which are not found </p>
<p>in the LXX (unless he used a tradition similar to eodotion and Symmachus, which </p>
<p>include the latter: Gladd 2009:299). Both words are included to aid his comparison of </p>
<p>this man with Christ.</p>
<p>99. See Ciampa/Rosner 2010:820.</p>
<p>100. See further, Ware 2014a:832–33.</p>
<p>101. Hultgren 2003:355–57. Dierently, Philo’s heavenly man based on Gen </p>
<p>1:26 comes rst, then the earthly man from Gen 2:7 (see comparisons in Horsley </p>
<p>1998:211–13; Perkins 2012:189). For a critique of the notion that Paul is reacting to </p>
<p>either Philonic/Alexandrian or Gnostic traditions or realized eschatology, see Hultgren </p>
<p>2003:343–70.</p>
