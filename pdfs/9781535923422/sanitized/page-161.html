<p>ird Supporting Proof (8:1—11:1)</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>First, all the Corinthians’ endeavors must be done to the glory of God. </p>
<p>Christ’s followers must acknowledge and honor God in everything they do, </p>
<p>giving thanks for the good gis of food, drink, health, life, and so on. is </p>
<p>recalls 8:1–6 and the importance of believers loving the one true God who </p>
<p>created all things through Christ. We also notice that all things to God’s </p>
<p>glory (10:31) replaces the Corinthian assumption of “all things permissible” </p>
<p>(10:23). Paul replaces anthropocentric thinking with a theocentric one, </p>
<p>“from an emphasis on rights to an emphasis on obedience and service.”</p>
<p>155</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>the strong consistently put God instead of themselves rst, they could avoid </p>
<p>idolatry and partnering with demons. Second, the Corinthians must not </p>
<p>be the cause of stumbling either to Jews or Greeks or the church of God. </p>
<p>ey should love others enough to be concerned that no believer falls away </p>
<p>from the gospel, and no unbeliever is hindered from accepting the gospel, </p>
<p>because of what they eat (8:7–13; 9:19–23; 10:27–29a). ird, Paul again </p>
<p>charges the Corinthians to be imitators of me just as I am also of Christ </p>
<p>(11:1; cf. 4:16; T.Benj. 4.1). He presents himself as an example to follow since </p>
<p>he tries to please all people in all things, not seeking his own advantage </p>
<p>but the advantage of many, so that they may be saved (cf. 9:19–22; 10:24). </p>
<p>e factors of exibility, appropriate conduct, purposeful gaining of others, </p>
<p>and imitating Christ who gave his life for the sake of others (Rom 5:8; 1 </p>
<p>ess 5:9–10) reect the apostle’s “salvic intentionality” as a missionary.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His adaptability reects neither ethical compromise nor attery but a refusal </p>
<p>to exercise his own rights and privileges for the sake of saving others. e </p>
<p>Corinthians ought to follow this example.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p> In essence the closing impera-</p>
<p>tives encourage Corinthians to love God, love their neighbor, and imitate </p>
<p>Christ as seen by the apostle’s example.</p>

<p>Paul ends his discourse in 10:31—11:1 with imperatives that will help his </p>
auditors make wise decisions when facing diverse situations related to idol
<p>foods. When these stand in nuce for the entire discourse, tensions between </p>
<p>Paul permitting the consumption of idol foods under certain circumstances </p>

<p>156. Quote from Barram 2011:237–41.</p>
<p>157. As Ehrensperger 2009:154, rightly arms, “the call to imitation, rather than </p>
<p>being an imposition of a domination pattern which has to be copied, refers to examples </p>
<p>of those who at least have attempted to embody the message of the gospel and its alter-</p>
<p>native values.” Contrast Castelli 1991:116.</p>
