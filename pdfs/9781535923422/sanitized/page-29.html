<p>Introduction</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Another myth centers on a boy named Melikertes whom Sisyphus </p>
<p>nds; he was brought to shore by a dolphin, a scene minted on Corinthian </p>
<p>tessera coins.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> Sisyphus buries him on the Isthmus and in his honor es-</p>
<p>tablishes the Isthmian games (Pausanius Descr. 2.1.3). In one version of </p>
<p>the story, Melikertes’s mother Ino jumps into the sea with him to escape </p>
<p>a deadly pursuit. She becomes the goddess Leukothea and he Palaimon, a </p>
<p>marine god. At the games his funerary rites seem to be reenacted, and Ro-</p>
<p>man colonists built a sanctuary for him.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e hero Bellerophon, grandson of Sisyphus, tames the winged horse </p>
<p>Pegasus aer consulting a wise seer in Corinth who has him seek Athena at </p>
<p>her temple for assistance. When he accidentally kills his brother, he stays in </p>
<p>Argos with king Proetus and rejects queen Anteia’s amorous advances. She </p>
<p>then accuses him of attempted rape. e king sends him away with a sealed </p>
<p>letter to king Iobates of Lycia requesting to kill him. is king refuses; he </p>
<p>opens the letter aer entertaining his guest and he fears such an act as a host </p>
<p>would spark Zeus’s wrath. Instead, he sends Bellerophon to do dangerous </p>
<p>tasks, one of which is to kill Chimaera the monstrous lion-goat-serpent, </p>
<p>which he succeeds in doing with Pegasus’s help. In later years he becomes </p>
<p>arrogant, attempting to ride Pegasus up to Olympus to live among the im-</p>
<p>mortals, but Pegasus throws o his rider, and Bellerophon becomes hated by </p>
<p>the gods.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>e fountain-spring of Peirene in Corinth, enduring to Roman</p>
<p>times, was considered sacred and commemorated the place where this hero </p>
<p>tamed Pegasus.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>Bellerophon’s battle with Chimaera appears in Corinthian</p>
<p>art,</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>and Corinthian coins with images of Pegasos connect the Greek myth</p>
<p>in solidarity with the new Roman colony.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>Another popular myth centers on King Oedipus. Oedipus has been </p>
<p>raised as the son of a royal couple in Corinth aer his real parents, King Lai-</p>
<p>us and Queen Jacosta of ebes, fear an oracle that their infant son would </p>
<p>eventually kill Laius. e king gives his servant the child to dispose of him, </p>
<p>but the servant gives him to a Corinthian herdsman, who gives him to the </p>
<p>Corinthian couple. When he grows up, Oedipus learns from the Oracle at </p>
<p>Delphi that he would kill his father and marry his mother. Fate and tragedy </p>
<p>take place as he leaves Corinth for ebes to avoid fullling the prophecy. </p>
