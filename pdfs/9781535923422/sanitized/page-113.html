<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>89</p>
<p>concerning the things you wrote. e introductory “now concerning” </p>
<p>(περί δέ) introduces new topics and perhaps Corinthian questions as well </p>
<p>(7:25; 8:1; 12:1; 16:1, 12).</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>With the statement, it is good for a man not to touch a woman, the </p>
<p>word “touch” (ἅπτω) is a euphemism for taking a woman for sexual grati-</p>
<p>cation (e.g., Plato Leg. 8.840A; Aristotle Pol. 7.14.12 [1335b]; Prov 6:29; </p>
<p>Josephus Ant. 1.163–64).</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>Paul promotes celibacy here. It is far from clear,</p>
<p>however, that the statement reiterates a Corinthian slogan or reects a sexu-</p>
<p>ally ascetic faction.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>Such a view is not implied anywhere in the Corinthian</p>
<p>correspondence, unless here. Not only does this view run counter to the </p>
<p>church’s excessive sexual promiscuity (chs. 5–6; 10:8; 2 Cor 12:21), but the </p>
<p>tone of this entire chapter suggests that Paul is addressing recipients who </p>
<p>want to have sex (7:4–5, 8–11, 25–39).</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>Moreover, Paul refers to celibacy</p>
<p>demurely, as though the Corinthians would not be sympathetic with the </p>
<p>idea (7:5b–9). If we assume that both single and married men in the con-</p>
<p>gregation are having sex with prostitutes (6:12–20), one man is commit-</p>
<p>ting incest (5:1), and possibly certain wealthier members who could aord </p>
<p>slaves are having sex with them, these words appear to be against all sexual </p>
<p>intercourse outside of marriage (cf. 7:2).</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>Paul seems to be responding to</p>
<p>their questions about fornication and sexual purity, and these inquiries are </p>
<p>probably motivated by what he had previously instructed them in an earlier </p>
<p>letter (cf. 5:9). Some of their questions may have been similar to these: “If we </p>
<p>are to be sexually pure as you instruct, Paul, what does that mean for mar-</p>
<p>ried couples in our congregation?” “And should our unmarried members </p>
<p>avoid marriage to stay sexually pure?” “Should members who have unbe-</p>
lieving spouses get divorced?” Paul now responds to their questions starting
<p>with a thematic statement in 7:1 that guides this entire chapter: celibacy is </p>
<p>best (7:7–8, 26, 38), and sex in marriage is second best.</p>
<p>Paul, not the Corinthians, employs the word good (καλόν) in 7:1, just </p>
<p>as he does in 7:8, 26, and 38.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>It reects his reluctance to give commands in</p>
<p>115. More reservedly, Mitchell 1991:235, claims that περί δέ only introduces a new </p>
<p>topic or argument (cf. 1 ess 4:9; 5:1). On περί + γράφω as a response to previous </p>
<p>correspondence, see Arzt-Grabner et al. 2006:243–44.</p>
<p>116. See Ciampa 2009:336–37. For Ciampa, ἅπτω may suggest sexual exploitation </p>
<p>but not necessarily rejection of all sex.</p>
<p>117. Pace, e.g., Deming 1995:5–49; Valentine 2013:520.</p>
<p>118. See May 2004:144–204; Ciampa/Rosner 2010:268–69.</p>
<p>119. As 7:2 claries, sex within marriage is excluded from this abstinence. Although </p>
<p>ἄνθρωπος in 7:1 can refer to “husband,” and γυνή could mean “wife,” the more generic </p>
<p>“man” and “woman,” are preferred, respectively (contra NIV).</p>
<p>120. See also 5:6; 9:15; Rom 14:21; Gal 4:18; pace Garland 2003:249.</p>
