<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>69</p>
<p>18:15–17. is decision may reect a sense of urgency on his part, perhaps </p>
<p>because of this man’s inuence on the congregation and the spiritual harm </p>
<p>he might cause, and because, if outsiders hear of this illegal aair, the entire </p>
<p>church risks being discredited. </p>
<p>If the Corinthians in their indierence toward this sin have tolerated </p>
<p>it, they have nothing to boast about. ey are too smug in their thinking, </p>
<p>and their boasting is not good.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>e oender and his vice, if not removed,</p>
<p>will aect other congregation members, which leads to the metaphorical </p>
<p>maxim, a little leaven pus up the whole batch of dough.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>e entire batch</p>
<p>represents the congregation, and the old leaven represents wickedness and </p>
<p>evil that seems to include the man’s sexual misconduct along with inated </p>
<p>Corinthian arrogance that turns a blind eye to it. Such vices are currently </p>
<p>present and will spread throughout the congregation if unchecked. e man </p>
<p>must therefore be purged from among the congregants so that they might </p>
<p>become a new batch of dough, one that is unleavened (puried), which is </p>
<p>in fact what they truly are in Christ. With the notion of unleavened bread, </p>
<p>Paul reminisces again on the Passover feast that includes slaying and eating </p>
<p>the lamb and the removal of all leaven from one’s house (Exod 12:3–20; </p>
<p>cf. Deut 16:1–8).</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>In Paul’s meal, however, Jesus functions as the Passover</p>
<p>lamb. In celebrating the Lord’s Supper (11:23–25), the congregation appears </p>
<p>to be familiar with their sacred meal originating from the Passover feast in </p>
<p>which Jesus broke unleavened bread and claimed it represented his body.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hence, when Paul mentions the Passover and unleavened bread here, the </p>
<p>Corinthians may have automatically heard the Lord’s Supper as the subtext, </p>
<p>and commemoration related to the meal conjured up images of Christ’s sac-</p>
<p>ricial death on the cross that eventually brought about their redemption </p>
<p>and purication from sin (cf. 1 Pet 1:18–19; John 1:29).</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>In this pristine</p>
<p>state they are holy like unleavened bread.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>But now the heinous sexual</p>
<p>acts of this man, along with other vices, jeopardize the moral purity of the </p>
<p>congregation. As Margaret Mitchell arms, “Like the orators who describe </p>
<p>factionalism as a disease which attacks one member and then spreads like </p>
<p>an inammation throughout the body, Paul draws upon the traditional im-</p>
