<p>Appeal to Be United and Avoid Discord: </p>
<p>Prothesis and Statement of Facts (1:10–17)</p>
<p>Aer the letter’s introduction Paul jumps straight into his primary concern </p>
<p>and purpose for writing to the Corinthians—he appeals that members live </p>
in unity with one another and end their internal divisions (1:10). is is
<p>the letter’s prothesis, which sets forth what the communicator intends to </p>
<p>prove; it functions as the statement of purpose for the entire discourse </p>
<p>(see also Introduction).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>e appeal in 1:10 also suggests the letter body is</p>
<p>deliberative in terms of rhetorical species.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Corporate unity and factions</p>
<p>is language relevant to the political sphere, and our apostle primarily at-</p>
<p>tempts to persuade the congregation to take a futuristic course of action </p>
<p>in favor of solidarity.</p>
<p>e theme of bodily unity and discord is clearly prominent in various </p>
<p>passages, but sometimes it is more implicit in others. Aer the prothesis, a </p>
<p>brief statement of facts or narratio then follows in which Paul mentions that </p>
he learned of the factions from Chloe’s people, and he addresses their divi-
<p>sions over apostolic leaders (1:11–17).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Repetition (anaphora) of the phrase</p>
<p>“I am of . . . ” followed by a string of ironic rhetorical questions elicit pathos. </p>
<p>We nd here a passionate apostle reasoning with this congregation against </p>
their divisive behavior. is section is followed up by supporting proofs of the prothesis starting in 1:18. e divisive allegiances named in 1:12 are re-
<p>peated in chapter 3, providing a subtle structural message:</p>
<p>A Allegiances Divide the Body of Christ (1:10–17)</p>
<p>B e Cross of Christ and Spiritual Wisdom Mend Divisions </p>
<p>(1:18—2:17)</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> Allegiances Divide the Temple of God (3:1—4:5)</p>
<p>1. Aristotle distinguishes between the “statement of the case” (πρόθεσις) and the </p>
<p>proof for it (Rhet. 3.13.1–2). e Latin propositio is the equivalent (Witherington </p>
<p>1995:94).</p>
