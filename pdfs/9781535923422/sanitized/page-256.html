<p>Closing Matters (1 Cor 16:1–24)</p>
<p>232</p>
<p>as potent if not translated into the vernacular of the curse’s recipients. e </p>
<p>unintelligent words inscribed on the statue of Artemis in Ephesus provides </p>
<p>an example.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>Since Paul writes from Ephesus, it is just possible that what</p>
<p>prompted his use of mystical words was seeing such inscriptions. We do </p>
<p>not know, however, that Paul’s Gentile audience did not understand what </p>
<p>maranatha means. It is always possible that he introduced the phrase and </p>
<p>its meaning to them when staying in Corinth. His Gentile converts are, aer </p>
<p>all, familiar with foreign words such as the Hebrew amen and Aramaic abba </p>
<p>(Rom 8:15; Gal 1:5; 4:6; Phil 4:20). </p>
<p>Mar means Lord, but a major question is whether Paul’s word is to </p>
<p>be understood as the perfect maran atha (“Our Lord has come”) or the </p>
<p>imperative marana tha (“Our Lord, come!”).</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>Kenneth Bailey argues that</p>
<p>for centuries Middle Eastern churches read this as a confession, and Syriac, </p>
<p>Aramaic, and Hebrew translations render this as “Our Lord has come.”</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is, he suggests, is expressed in celebration of the Eucharist that arms </p>
<p>the Lord’s presence at the meal—the Lord has come or “Our Lord is here.”</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Problematic with this view is that Paul’s Eucharist anticipates consumption </p>
<p>of the meal by looking forward to a futuristic time “until he [Christ] comes” </p>
<p>(11:26). For Matthew Black, ambiguity and exibility with Paul’s term may </p>
<p>have invited various uses early on, so that we nd the phrase as a confession </p>
<p>or imprecation or in Eucharistic settings (cf. Did. 10.6).</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>Revelation 22:20</p>
<p>supports the imperative meaning, “Come, Lord Jesus!” (ἔρχου κύριε Ἰησοῦ) </p>
<p>in anticipation of Christ’s return. Ultimately, a structural aspect in Paul’s </p>
<p>letter supports that the imperatival/confessional meaning of marantha is </p>
<p>correct or at least should not be excluded. Paul ends this letter as he began </p>
<p>it—with a prayer to the Lord Jesus and expectation of his coming (1:2, 7–8), </p>
<p>though in 16:22 Paul exhibits the potential converse of his recipients be-</p>
<p>ing blameless at the Lord’s coming. e imperative meaning for maranatha </p>
<p>also supports rather pointedly that the earliest followers of Jesus, who spoke </p>
<p>Aramaic, prayed to Jesus as Lord, associating him with the sacred name for </p>
<p>God in the Hebrew Scriptures.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>e nal benediction, the grace of our Lord Jesus be with you, with </p>
<p>variations, ends all of Paul’s undisputed letters as his virtual trademark (e.g., </p>
<p>49. Ibid., esp. 284.</p>

<p>52. Ibid. 498.</p>
<p>53. Black 1973:196. Black posits two main options as “‘the Lord will (soon, surely) </p>
<p>come’ at the Parousia” (cf. Phil 4:5) or ‘Our Lord, come.’”</p>
