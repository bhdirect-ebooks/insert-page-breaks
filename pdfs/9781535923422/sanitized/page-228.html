<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>

<p>persuades by rational argumentation, such as by example or enthymeme.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A string of conditional clauses beginning with “if” rally against resurrection </p>
<p>denials. iselton correctly distills Paul’s reasoning: “If the universal prin-</p>
<p>ciple has no currency, by deductive logic a particular instance of it has no </p>
<p>currency either.”</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>Anders Eriksson poses an argument from consequences</p>
<p>in which the premise, If there is no resurrection from the dead (15:13a; </p>
<p>cf. 16a) requires the missing premise to be, “And Christ is one of the dead.” </p>
<p>From this the conclusion follows, neither has Christ been raised (15:13b, </p>
<p>16b).</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>is conclusion then becomes a sorites posed as a condition from</p>
<p>which arise further negative outcomes (15:14b–15, 17b–18, 19) so as to </p>
<p>create two complementary structures built on previous premises stated or </p>
<p>implied:</p>
<p>A. But if there is no resurrection from the dead, neither has Christ been </p>
<p>raised (15:13)</p>
<p>B. And if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is in vain </p>
<p>(15:14a–b)</p>
<p>C. (If our proclamation is in vain, then) your faith is in vain </p>
<p>(15:14c)</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>. And (if Christ has not been raised) we are found also to be false </p>
<p>witnesses concerning God because we testied against God that </p>
<p>He raised Christ (15:15a–b)</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>. When God did not raise (Christ) since the dead are not raised </p>
<p>(15:15c–d)</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>. For if the dead are not raised, neither has Christ been raised (15:16)</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>. And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is in vain (15:17a–b)</p>
<p>C.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> (If your faith is in vain) you are yet in your sins (15:17c)</p>
<p>D. en (if you and others who are in Christ are yet in sin) </p>
<p>those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished (15:18).</p>
<p>blending judicial and deliberative elements.</p>
<p>37. i.e., a rhetorical deduction oen requiring audiences to ll out an abbreviated </p>
<p>syllogism (cf. Aristotle Rhet. 1.2.2–8; Quintilian Inst 5.10.1–3; Eriksson 1998:38–43).</p>
