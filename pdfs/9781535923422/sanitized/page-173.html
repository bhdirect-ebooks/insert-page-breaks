<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>

<p>long hair on a man is a dishonor to him but a woman’s long hair is a glory </p>
<p>to her. For Paul both propriety (πρέπω) and nature (φύσις) lay claim to </p>
<p>what is observationally self-evident. e former may connote here what is </p>
<p>conspicuously tting “on the eye.”</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>e eye of the beholder in this case is</p>
<p>relative to Roman custom in which men’s hairstyles were generally shorter </p>
<p>than women’s, and long hair might take away from masculinity. Of course, </p>
<p>Paul knew of exceptions to this custom, such as long-haired men honor-</p>
<p>ing Nazirite vows (e.g., Judg 13–16), and so we suspect his words are at </p>
<p>least partially a rhetorical attempt to discourage congregants obsessed with </p>
<p>sophists who had long and elaborate hairdos and looked eeminate (Philo </p>
<p>Spec. 3.37–38; Ps.-Phoc. 210–12; Philostratus Vit. soph. 1.8.489; Epictet<span class="_ _0" />us, </p>
<p>Diatr. 3.1.1–45; see 1 Cor 2).</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>Unlike his argument from propriety, however, Paul’s argument from </p>
<p>nature expects uniform agreement.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>It connotes for Paul what is endowed</p>
<p>by God’s creation. Nature, of course, does not determine hair length, but it </p>
<p>does exhibit gender dierentiation regarding sex organs, voice, and (relevant </p>
<p>to hair) beards and bald heads for males (cf. Epictetus Diatr. 1.16.9–14). His </p>
<p>argument from nature would likely be understood by the Corinthians as </p>
<p>self-evident. Branson Parler shows that the ancient physiological models of </p>
<p>Aristotle and Hippocrates teach gender dierentiation inclusive of hair on </p>
<p>one’s head, which was believed to draw moisture and semen upward:</p>
<p>Men expel seed and women receive it in order to produce new </p>
<p>life. . . . Short hair on a man would mean less suction power to </p>
<p>hold the semen in the man&apos;s body thus enabling him to better </p>
<p>fulll (part of) his natural, teleological function of procreation. </p>
<p>Likewise, long hair on a woman would mean more suction </p>
<p>power to draw the semen into her uterus and thus enable her </p>
<p>to better fulll (part of) her natural, teleological function of </p>
<p>procreation. In this physiological paradigm, hair is not merely </p>
<p>a marker of socially constructed gender roles (though it may be </p>
<p>that as well) but an essential part of the procreative dierence </p>
<p>between male and female.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e man’s long hair, then, may signal infertility and less masculinity, where-</p>
<p>as the woman’s long hair signals fertility and more femininity. Her unveiled </p>
<p>hair is doubtless beautiful and an honor to her and her husband in private </p>
