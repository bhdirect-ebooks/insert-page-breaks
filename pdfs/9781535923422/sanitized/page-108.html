<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>84</p>
<p>believer’s own body as well as their community. Second, some things have a </p>
way of bringing individuals under the power and enslavement of the thing
<p>permitted (6:12d). is is what vices and addictive habits do and should </p>
<p>therefore be avoided. ird, against moral irrelevance, Paul argues that the </p>
<p>believer’s body is not for the purpose of fornication but for (i.e., belongs </p>
<p>to) the Lord, and the Lord gave himself for the body of the believer on </p>
<p>the cross (6:13c; cf. 6:20a). e full redemption of the believer’s body that </p>
<p>was rst implemented by Christ’s sacricial death will become fully evident </p>
<p>when God, who raised the Lord . . . will raise us up by His power. As such, </p>
<p>the believer’s body is sacred; it belongs to the Lord, not prostitutes, and </p>
<p>awaits its own resurrection. Regardless of what might happen to the belly </p>
at death, the body will not be done away with but transformed by divine
<p>power, similar to Christ’s resurrection (cf. 15:20–56).</p>
<p>Our apostle now presents three more perspectives guided by the rhe-</p>
<p>torical question, Do you not know (6:15, 16, 19), which insinuates they </p>
<p>ought to know better, and so they should change their current way of think-</p>
ing. e rst question informs the Corinthians that their individual bodies
<p>are members or body parts of the corporate body of Christ (cf. 12:12–27). </p>
<p>is body is not simply a metaphorical construct for the church but a com-</p>
<p>munal entity that actually connects the resurrected body of Christ with the </p>
individual bodies of believers through God’s Spirit who dwells in and joins
<p>them all together in solidarity.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>With this understanding intact, a further</p>
<p>question is posed: Shall I take away parts of (the body of) Christ and make </p>
<p>them parts of (the body of) a prostitute? Paul answers using the diatribe </p>
<p>negation, may it never be!</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>e conjoining of Christ’s body parts with a</p>
<p>prostitute via his followers intends to shock the auditors.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> is is a pic-</p>
<p>ture of mutilating the body and distorting the image of Christ.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>e body</p>
<p>parts probably should not be thought of as generic; Paul just mentioned </p>
<p>the κοιλία inclusive of sexual organs. e scene elicits sexual organs being </p>
<p>attached to the vagina or womb of the prostitute, which implies a surrender-</p>
<p>ing of one’s bodily and sexual powers to her. If the members are metaphori-</p>
<p>cally removed from Christ’s body, another implication is that their identity </p>
<p>94. e Spirit metaphorically functions as though the blood or arteries of this </p>
<p>body. Alternatively, if “spirit” is perceived materially, then “those in Christ are literally </p>
<p>of the same stu. All share the very same pneuma—Christ’s” (Stowers 2008:360).</p>
<p>95. Cf. Malherbe 1980:231–40.</p>
<p>96. Martin 1995:176–78, imagines Christ’s body penetrating or being penetrated </p>
<p>by the prostitute, but the verb αἴρω, does not mean “take” from Christ’s body (NRSV) </p>
<p>but “take away” from it (NASB), which may depict removing the body parts and then </p>
<p>joining them to a prostitute (see Robertson/Plummer 1925:125).</p>
<p>97. See Liu 2013:165–94.</p>
