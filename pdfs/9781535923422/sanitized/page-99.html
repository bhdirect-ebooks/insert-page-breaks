<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>75</p>
<p>chapter as he expresses indignation with the opening question, Dare any </p>
<p>of you?</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>To elicit pathos Paul employs shame and kinship (6:1, 5–6, 8). He</p>
<p>presents himself in the imagery of a prudent head of the family attempting </p>
to reconcile divisions in the form of sibling rivalry within the household
<p>of faith. Ten questions are posed in the rst nine verses.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>Among these,</p>
<p>Do you not know? is ironic (6:2, 3, 9)—the congregation ought to know </p>
<p>dierently than how it presently knows and acts. Paul presents further irony </p>
<p>in 6:4–5 and uses “lesser to greater” (qal wahomer) argumentation (6:2–3), </p>
<p>reduplication (6:7), antitheses (6:1, 6), and multiplicity of conjunctions </p>
<p>(polysyndeton) (6:9–11). </p>
<p>e issue at hand in 6:1–8 is a legal dispute among congregation </p>
<p>members, which is brought before the unbelieving Roman courts instead </p>
<p>of kept inside the church. e least signicant court cases (“κριτηρίων </p>
<p>ἐλαχίστων”) and daily life matters (βιωτικός) contrast the astounding </p>
<p>commission of the saints to judge the world and angels. Paul urges unity by </p>
<p>stressing “how insignicant are the matters about which the various sides </p>
<p>contend.”</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>Such triing, according to Dio Chrysostom, is compared to “an</p>
<p>ass’s shadow” (Or. 34.48). Paul’s stress on triviality suggests that civil dis-</p>
<p>putes rather than weighty legal matters, such as murder and uprisings, are </p>
<p>at issue in the congregation. Everyday matters include, among other things, </p>
<p>money, property disputes, and matters of inheritance.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>Although we are</p>
<p>not privy to the Corinthian litigations at stake, fraud and wrongdoing may </p>
<p>suggest issues involving money (6:7–8; cf. Phlm 18–19; Jas 5:4).</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>Roman lawsuits are generally conducted between social equals; charg-</p>
<p>es could not be led by those of lowly status against elitists.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>e wealthy,</p>
<p>however, could take someone of lower status to court.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>As Winter arms,</p>
<p>the powerful “exercised a number of unfair advantages in the judicial sys-</p>
<p>tem. . . . ese included nancial qualications for jury service, inuence </p>
<p>over honorary magistrates and judges, and the importance given to social </p>
<p>status in weighing judgment.”</p>
<p>56</p>
<p> Dio Chrysostom specically describes Co-</p>
<p>reects 1 Cor 5, and more dicult judgments in Deut 17:8–13 reect 1 Cor 6.</p>
<p>49. Cf. Konradt 2003:331.</p>
<p>50. If 6:6 is posed as a question and independent of 6:5 (e.g., NET) this would make </p>
<p>eleven.</p>
