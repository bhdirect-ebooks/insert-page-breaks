<p>moral beliefs and principles that makes judgments about what is right and </p>
<p>wrong,” then someone with a weak conscience is prone to make poor moral </p>
<p>judgments and base them on defective criteria.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Along with internal conicts, the weak members likely face external </p>
<p>pressure from unbelieving compatriots and family members who would like </p>
<p>nothing more than for their relative, friend, or neighbor to return to eating </p>
<p>idol meals just like before. And now these believers potentially nd fellow </p>
<p>congregation members also participating in these meals! What concerns </p>
<p>Paul the most is that if these weak members consume food dedicated to </p>
<p>other deities, they will interpret the act as idolatry since they believe these </p>
<p>deities are real. As a result, they may lock into their minds their failure and </p>
<p>unfaithfulness to Paul’s deity, and they would then resume their obligations </p>
<p>and devotion to former deities as they abandon faith in God and Christ.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>It is clear that Paul does not fault them for being weak; their weakness </p>
<p>is not associated with sin or evil. But beyond the maxim-like statement in </p>
<p>8:8, why doesn’t he do more to correct their misperception about deities? </p>
<p>ey probably are recent converts who never had the privilege of Paul’s tu-</p>
<p>telage. If so, they may still need to grow in some of the basics of their faith </p>
<p>in order to become mature enough to fully appreciate apostolic teachings. </p>
<p>Stanley Stowers astutely writes that the goal of living in Christ with which </p>
<p>Paul identies is not “to relieve the weak of every irrational belief by means </p>
<p>of arguments over arguments . . . such a narrow view is counterproductive </p>
<p>in achieving an inclusive and mutually enhancing community.”</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>If we add</p>
<p>to this their former lifestyle of serving other deities has already been wo-</p>
<p>ven into the very fabric of their being for many years, such convincing to </p>
<p>the contrary by Paul might require many face-to-face conversations with </p>
<p>them, something he could not presently do given his missionary schedule. </p>
<p>We could only imagine the diculty teachers in the church might have at-</p>
<p>tempting to change the beliefs of a convert who, during her pre-converted </p>
<p>years, had prayed to the god Asclepius for healing and that healing took </p>
<p>place. Despite anything they might claim about this deity not existing, this </p>
<p>believer would think otherwise, and even be tempted to pray to Asclepius </p>
<p>again, especially if the Christian God did not seem to be answering her </p>
<p>prayers.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Paul introduces a better plan for the congregation, at least until he</p>
<p>18. Garland 2003:383.</p>
<p>19. Alternatively, they might syncretize worship of the Christian God with other </p>
<p>deities (Borgen 1995:51).</p>
<p>20. Stowers 1990:284.</p>
<p>21. Interestingly, Fotopolous 2003:63–70, makes a case for the dining area of the </p>
<p>Asklepion being functional at this time, a likely place to eat idol food.</p>
