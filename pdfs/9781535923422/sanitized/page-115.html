<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>91</p>
<p>sex for the purpose of procreation.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>His concern here is for sexual purity</p>
<p>and that marital sex be mutual, seless, and frequent.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>At least three streams of thought can inform Paul’s sense of mutuality. </p>
<p>First, if the believer’s body belongs to Jesus (cf. 6:12–20), this sets up a </p>
<p>comparison in which the married sex partner does not have rights over </p>
<p>his/her own body; it belongs to the spouse.</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>is results in tending to the</p>
<p>sexual needs of the other spouse before one’s own needs. It also helps pre-</p>
<p>vent the husband from doing as he pleases sexually with household slaves, </p>
<p>courtesans, or anyone else—authority over his body belongs to his wife </p>
<p>rather than himself, and she disapproves of these relationships.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>Second,</p>
<p>since males and females are on equal ground in Christ (Gal 3:28), their </p>
<p>sexual needs should be equally met. ird, Scripture may inform Paul, es-</p>
<p>pecially on the point of conjugal duty—the husband must not deprive his </p>
<p>spouse of her basic necessities, clothing, and conjugal rights that include </p>
<p>sexual intercourse (Exod 21:10–11). Also, mutual possession of one’s lover, </p>
<p>such as expressed in the erotic poem wherein the woman’s lover “is mine </p>
<p>and I am his” (Cant 2:16; 6:3), might inform Paul. Spouses can withdraw </p>
<p>from sexual activities only with the consent of their partner for a time of </p>
<p>separation in order to devote yourselves to prayer.</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>e reason may be</p>
<p>to avoid distractions on account of the urgency of the petition. e couple </p>
<p>must then resume sex again right aer that time is over so that Satan may </p>
<p>not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>God’s nemesis lures</p>
<p>believers to fornication, presumably by sending attractive but unscrupu-</p>
lous individuals their way.
<p>In 7:6, Paul appears to qualify his earlier statements. It is by way of </p>
<p>concession, not as a command, that he advises sex in marriage. He prefers </p>
<p>that believers be unmarried and celibate like I am. It is not clear whether he </p>
<p>had been single his whole life, was a widower, or was abandoned by his wife </p>
<p>aer he started following Christ. e latter gains support if Paul’s “us” in </p>
<p>125. On sex for procreation, see Josephus Ag. Ap. 2.199; Musonius Rufus Lect 13A. </p>
<p>Dierently, Philo (like Paul) can arm marital sex is pleasurable: QG 3.20–21; Abr. </p>
<p>245–46; Loader 2013:117.</p>
<p>126. How frequent? Opinions range from daily to 6 months in Plutarch Solon 20.3; </p>
<p>m. Ketub. 5.6; Ciampa/Rosner 2010:280.</p>
<p>127. On similar mutuality, see Musonius Rufus Lect. 13A; Plutarch Conj. praec. </p>
<p>9–10[139C]; and for conjugal rights/obligations in Hellenistic and Rabbinic sources, </p>
<p>see respectively, Grant 2001:127; Garland 2003:258.</p>
<p>128. Cf. Ciampa/Rosner 268, 281. Notice Musonius Rufus Lect 12.</p>
<p>129. See similarly, T. Naph. 8.8. Weaker manuscript support includes “fasting” (cf. </p>
<p>KJV).</p>
<p>130. On Beliar luring through sexual enticement, see CD[A]4.15–20; T.Reub. 6.1–4; </p>
<p>cf. Tob 6:16–22 (VT).</p>
