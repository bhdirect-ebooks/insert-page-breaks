<p>to do this (i.e., eat unleavened bread and drink from the cup of wine) in </p>
<p>remembrance of me (11:24c, 25c) recalls Passover observances in remem-</p>
<p>brance of Israel’s redemption from Egyptian slavery (Exod 12:14; 13:9; Deut </p>
<p>16:3; Jub 49:7–23).</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>rough the Lord’s dinner, however, remembrance is</p>
<p>centered on the redemption that Jesus’s death brings.</p>
<p>Other scriptural traditions are echoed in Jesus’s words, is is my </p>
<p>body which is for you (11:24b) and is cup is the new covenant in my </p>
<p>blood (11:25b). In the rst saying, “for you,” reects Isa 53:5, which suggests </p>
<p>a sacricial expiation anticipated in body of the suering servant (52:13—</p>
<p>53:12), whom emergent Christians interpret as Christ. It became, as Ben </p>
<p>Meyer convincingly argues, part of early faith formulae that predate Paul.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p> </p>
<p>rough such language Christ’s crucixion was linked with redemption </p>
<p>and expiation from sin.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>Paul associates these thoughts with the sacricial</p>
<p>notion that Christ died “for our sins” according to Scripture (15:3). e sec-</p>
<p>ond saying recalls Moses establishing the covenant of the Law by sprinkling </p>
<p>blood and sharing a meal with the leaders of Israel in God’s presence (Exod </p>
<p>24:8–11). Similarly, Christ establishes a “new covenant” with his own blood </p>
<p>represented by the wine shared with his disciples. ese words also may </p>
<p>recall Jeremiah’s new and everlasting covenant (Jer 31:31–33; 32:38–40). </p>
<p>rough Christ’s death, Paul and other Christians believed they were living </p>
<p>in the era predicted by Jeremiah in which God’s relationship with the faith-</p>
<p>ful was characterized by inner transformation, laws written on their hearts, </p>
<p>and the forgiveness of sins (2 Cor 3:3–6). </p>
<p>Christ’s story is retold by his community as they visibly reenact the </p>
<p>Lord’s death by partaking of the bread and wine. is death becomes the </p>
<p>story of their own redemption not from Egypt but from the fallen pres-</p>
<p>ent age infested by sin and Satan which once enslaved them. Aer their </p>
<p>redemption, the followers of Christ embark on their own prophetic exodus-</p>
<p>wilderness journey that nds its rest in God’s heavenly kingdom (10:1–11). </p>
<p>Until that rest is realized, the Corinthians along with all Christ’s followers </p>
<p>are to proclaim through their enactment of this commemorative meal the </p>
<p>Lord’s death until he comes. By sharing in the Lord&apos;s death this way, they </p>
<p>will also share in his resurrection at his second coming (15:20–24). Par-</p>
<p>ticipation in this meal, then, “becomes a focal point where past deliverance, </p>
<p>present sustenance, and future hope intersect.”</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>Paul’s review of this meal</p>
<p>aims to instill his Corinthian auditors both with the sacredness of this meal </p>
