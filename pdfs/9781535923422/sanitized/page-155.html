<p>ird Supporting Proof (8:1—11:1)</p>
<p>131</p>
<p>exclusion from God’s kingdom, the same fate as vice-doers (6:9–11; 9:27; </p>
<p>cf. Gal 5:1–4, 19–21; Rom 11:22; Heb 4:11).</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>Like Stoic sages who were</p>
<p>thought to be unconquerable, the strong members in Corinth seem to think </p>
<p>themselves unable to fall from their wise status.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>rough their pued up</p>
<p>knowledge that an idol is nothing, they deem themselves immune to idola-</p>
try. A smug sense of spiritual security has led them to the brink of divine
<p>displeasure, and Paul exposes this attitude as deceptive and dangerous.</p>
<p>e intensity of this text is partially relieved in 10:13. Paul rhetorically </p>
<p>osets his auditors’ potential to be overwhelmed by counter-balancing the </p>
<p>warnings with a word of encouragement.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>No temptation has overtaken</p>
<p>you except what is common to all humanity.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>Not only do other people</p>
<p>face similar struggles, but the humanness of the temptation suggests its in-</p>
<p>ability to overpower one’s capacity to endure it.</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>Temptation to commit</p>
<p>vice can be successfully overcome. For those who genuinely desire to do </p>
<p>what is right in this situation, God is faithful (cf. Deut 32:4).</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>God can be</p>
<p>relied on not only to prevent the temptation from going beyond what the </p>
<p>believer is able to endure, but at the same time of the temptation He will </p>
<p>provide the result that you may be able to bear up under it.</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>God will</p>
<p>certainly help the one who is tempted if that person really wants help.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>involves more than merely a passive waiting on God but active resistance—</p>
<p>the Corinthians in this situation must resolve to ee from idolatry (10:14). </p>
<p>Paul thus encourages his auditors “by arming a perseverance that does </p>
<p>not diminish the dangers of apostasy or personal responsibility. For Paul, </p>
perseverance here implies divine assistance plus human endurance. He is
<p>conveying to the Corinthians that apostasy is a real danger, while persever-</p>
<p>ance is a real hope.”</p>

<p>Πειρασμός (“temptation”) here refers to allurement to commit vice rather than suer-</p>
<p>ings or hardship.</p>
<p>127. Similarly, Weiss 1910:255.</p>
<p>128. ough as Deut 32 evinces, God’s people are not always faithful. </p>
<p>129. On ἔκβασις as “result/outcome” see Arzt-Grabner et al. 2006:370–71; as “end” </p>
<p>see Fee 1987:461. Alternatively, it could mean the “way out” (BDAG 300§3) but Weiss </p>
<p>255, says this makes the need to bear up under it seem unnecessary.</p>
<p>130. Notice Barrett 1968:229: “e way out is for those who seek it, not for those </p>
<p>who (like the Corinthians) are, where idolatry is concerned, looking for the way in.”</p>
