<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>rst to reect God’s likeness and glory, this rst-hand reection is somehow </p>
<p>deected by his wearing a head covering in worship. Ciampa and Rosner try </p>
<p>to make sense of this by suggesting that “nothing should happen in worship </p>
<p>that would detract from God’s glory, including behavior that would draw </p>
<p>attention to the glory of man,” and since the woman is the glory of man, that </p>
<p>glory should be covered when worshipping God.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>A climactic moment in the pericope, as evinced by its location in the </p>
<p>chiasm’s center (see above), is when Paul writes, for this reason, the woman </p>
<p>ought to have authority (ἐξουσία) over her head (11:10a).</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> is author-</p>
<p>ity is not placed under someone else’s power (i.e., that of her husband or </p>
<p>another man; such an idea nds no lexical support). Rather, the woman </p>
<p>exercises this authority herself.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>She has the right to be in charge of her</p>
<p>own head, and that means she should control her hair and make it respect-</p>
<p>able for public viewing. Paul’s expectation is that she will take responsibility </p>
<p>herself to wear a covering and thus avoid exposing her head to indignity. </p>
<p>is would honor gender distinction, demonstrate faithfulness to her hus-</p>
<p>band, and prevent other males from lustfully looking at her as she prays and </p>
<p>prophecies.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>is approach is in keeping with Paul’s concern for correcting</p>
<p>the Corinthian perspective of authority “precisely in the sense of rights or </p>
<p>freedoms claimed by his readers which he seeks to have them voluntarily </p>
<p>subordinate to broader community values.”</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>e next phrase, because of the messengers is bewildering only if, as </p>
<p>many Bible versions do, ἄγγελος is translated as “angels” rather than “mes-</p>
<p>sengers.” If referring to supernatural beings, interpretations run the gamut </p>
<p>from good angels who might be oended by the disorder of unveiled women, </p>
<p>to bad angels who might lust aer the unveiled women akin with the myth </p>
<p>of the heavenly Watchers who birthed giants through female earthlings </p>
<p>(e.g., 1 En. 6–7; T.Reub. 5.5–6).</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> If the phrase is adopted from the Corin-</p>
<p>thians’ own vocabulary, we could only speculate blindly about what they, let </p>
<p>alone Paul, might have meant by these angels. Perhaps a more viable option </p>
<p>is Winter’s understanding of τοὺς ἀγγέλους as “the messengers,” i.e., human </p>
<p>messengers, not angels (Gen 32:4; Luke 9:52; Epictetus, Diatr. 3.22.23). In </p>
<p>34. Ciampa/Rosner 2010:527; cf. Hooker 1964:415.</p>
<p>35. “For this reason” (“διὰ τοῦτο”) can point forward to “because of the ἄγγελος” </p>
<p>(Schrage 1994:2.513) or in both directions (Fee 1987:518).</p>
<p>36. BeDuhn 1999:302–33, provides evidence and arms that “Paul always employs </p>
<p>the term to mean authority held by the subject.”</p>
<p>37. Ibid. 303–4; Garland 2003:525–26.</p>
<p>38. BeDuhn 1999:303. </p>
<p>39. See various options in Tolmie 2011:4–5; Stuckenbruck 2001:220–34; Fitzmyer </p>
