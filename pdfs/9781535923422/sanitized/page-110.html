<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>

<p>ignorant as you are of your own nature and subject to the anger </p>
<p>of God” (Diatr. 2.8.11–14). </p>
<p>Although Paul does not assume that God or Zeus is part of the human be-</p>
<p>ing, he does arm that God’s Spirit dwells in humans. e Spirit dwells </p>
<p>within both the temple of the corporate body of the congregation (3:16) as </p>
<p>well as in the temple of the body of each believer (6:19; cf. v.14, 17; 2 Cor </p>
<p>1:22; Rom 8:11; Gal 4:6).</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>As such, both the community in Christ and</p>
<p>the believer’s own body are holy, set apart from outsiders, and must not be </p>
<p>deled with the vice of fornication.</p>
<p>Two moral imperatives are advanced to ensure sexual purity of the </p>
<p>community (6:18, 20). e rst command is a prohibition. e Corinthians </p>
<p>must ee fornication. A parallel thought is found in eon who writes that </p>
<p>Sophocles was asked how he fared in relation to sex with women, to which </p>
<p>the poet responds, “Hush, man. I have escaped these things most gladly, </p>
<p>like a slave running away from a mad and savage master” (Prog. 2[66]). </p>
<p>More generally, Horace writes, “To ee vice is the beginning of virtue, and </p>
<p>to have got rid of folly is the beginning of wisdom” (Ep. 1.1.41; cf. Crates </p>
<p>Ep. 15). Similarly, Jewish wisdom warns readers against the temptress who </p>
<p>ruins lives (Prov 5:1–11; 7:4–27; Sir 41:17–22), and the patriarch Joseph </p>
<p>must ee from Potipher’s wife who attempts to have sex with him (Gen 39:7 </p>
<p>–13; T.Reub. 4.6–11). Such texts establish that escape from sexual sin was a </p>
<p>well-worn theme for Paul to adapt without immediate dependence on only </p>
<p>one source. For the Corinthians any location where prostitutes might tempt </p>
<p>them becomes the place from which to ee. </p>
<p>e notion that every sin a person commits is outside the body </p>
<p>might employ again a Corinthian interlocutor who justies fornication.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>It</p>
<p>perhaps reects Stoic thinking in which there is nothing good or evil out-</p>
<p>side of intention or moral purpose (Epictetus, Diatr. 3.10.18; cf. 2.10.25; </p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius Med. 6.32), and in later writers this idea seems to have </p>
<p>extended to indierence toward sexual activities.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>e apostle makes the</p>
<p>qualication, but the one who commits fornication sins against his own </p>
<p>body. is, too, resembles Stoic thinking. Musonius Rufus claims that those </p>
<p>who commit adultery and are joined with a courtesan prostitute (ἑταίρα) do </p>
<p>wrong (ἁμαρτάνει) and ruin themselves, making themselves dishonorable </p>
<p>103. In 6:19 “the body” (τὸ σῶμα) is singular with a distributive genitive plural “of </p>
<p>you,” (ὑμῶν) as in 2 Cor 4:10; Rom 8:23; Phil 3:21: (Gupta 2010:522–23): “‘the body of </p>
<p>each of you’ is a temple . . . ”</p>
