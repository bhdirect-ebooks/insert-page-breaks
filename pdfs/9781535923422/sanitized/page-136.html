<p>could revisit them. He teaches the strong members to relinquish their right </p>
<p>to eat idol foods out of love and concern for the weak.</p>
<p>Paul claims that idol foods have no intrinsic properties of good or evil. </p>
<p>Food does not bring us to God, whether into His favor or judgment. ere </p>
<p>is no spiritual advantage or disadvantage with regard to what a believer eats </p>
<p>(8:8).</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>If this is a saying of the strong, Paul seems to agree with it because</p>
<p>elsewhere he promotes indierence toward food (Rom 14:14; cf. 1 Cor </p>
<p>9:4; 10:30–31). His view on the matter is rather progressive given Jewish </p>
<p>food laws and disdain for idol meats (cf. 4 Macc 5:2; Jos.Asen. 10:12–13; </p>
<p>21:13–14; Sib. Or. 2.95). He cannot be indierent, however, given the cur-</p>
<p>rent circumstance, and so he warns the strong to beware that this right </p>
<p>of yours does not somehow become a stumbling-block to weak believ-</p>
<p>ers. is “right” (ἐξουσία) has undertones of freedom and authority and is </p>
<p>perhaps the strong’s own terminology for justifying their eating; Paul now </p>
<p>uses it in conversation with them. e word stumbling-block (πρόσκομμα: </p>
<p>cf. Rom 14:13) is virtually synonymous with the verb σκανδαλίζω that Paul </p>
<p>uses in reference to causing a fellow believer to stumble/fall down (8:13). </p>
<p>In the LXX both terms are used in relation to committing idolatry.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Since</p>
<p>this stumbling results in the believer’s destruction (8:11), it does not merely </p>
<p>connote sin or giving oense but falling away from faith (cf. 2 Cor 11:29; </p>
<p>Matt 24:10; Mark 4:17; Luke 17:2; John 16:1).</p>
<p>e way the strong members’ eating might become a stumbling-block </p>
<p>is explicated in the form of a question expecting an armative answer—if </p>
<p>any among the weak sees you who has knowledge reclining in an idol’s </p>
<p>temple, will not his conscience be emboldened to eat things sacriced </p>
<p>to idols? Paul does not seem to disallow the strong from eating in these </p>
<p>temples, probably because he is aware that not every meal in a temple set-</p>
<p>ting involves idol worship. Such facilities also serve community and private </p>
<p>clubs and have dining areas that seem to be used for many dierent pur-</p>
<p>poses.</p>
<p>24</p>
Idol foods might also be served at events as diverse as funerals,
<p>weddings, birthdays, holy days, and other occasions, whether in private </p>
<p>homes or temples.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> Since Paul speaks hypothetically here, we cannot de-</p>
<p>termine for certain that the strong are actually eating in such temples. But </p>
<p>given the extended warning in 10:1–22, the imperatives against idolatry in </p>
