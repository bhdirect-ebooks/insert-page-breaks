<p>151</p>
<p>Paul, however,</p>
<p>presents himself as an example regarding love and thus keeps the encomium </p>
<p>serving the purpose of deliberative rhetoric.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>Although similar love lists</p>
<p>were known,</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>Paul shows no dependence on these or other traditions. Our</p>
<p>apostle presents the futility of spiritual gis without love (13:1–3), identies </p>
<p>two descriptors of what love is (13:4a), and then using anaphora (repetition) </p>
<p>he enlists eight things that love does “not” do and four things love “always” </p>
<p>does (13:4b–7). e temporal and incomplete state of spiritual gis is then </p>
<p>set in antithesis to love’s enduring and complete character (13:8–12). e </p>
<p>conclusion uses asyndeton (no conjunctions) to exhibit love as the greatest </p>
<p>way. In keeping with Paul’s appeal for unity, love promotes concord and </p>
<p>combats against factions.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>Without love, members in the body of Christ</p>
<p>would be using their gis for selsh purposes and not for the care and edi-</p>
<p>cation of other members. e importance of love in 1 Cor 12–14, then, is </p>
<p>essential—spiritual gis have no value without it.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p>Paul presents himself hypothetically as a person excelling in spiritual </p>
<p>gis but failing to operate in love (13:1–3). He takes the gis in these verses </p>
<p>to their full potential in order to make their uselessness without love all </p>
<p>the more amplied. e tongues of humans and of angels together prob-</p>
<p>ably refer to both human languages, as in Acts 2:1–13, and heavenly lan-</p>
<p>guages.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p>Such glossolalia are included among the “varieties” of tongues</p>
<p>in 1 Cor 12:10. Daniel Wallace claims in 13:1–3 that Paul moves from the </p>
<p>actual (e.g., gi of prophecy) to hypothetical (e.g., Paul does not understand </p>
<p>all mysteries and knowledge): “It is therefore probable that Paul could </p>
<p>speak in the tongues of human beings, but not in the tongues of angels (v. </p>
<p>1).”</p>
<p>157</p>
<p>Although the hypothetical seems impossible to achieve if promoting</p>
<p>omniscience in v. 2, it is achievable with the gi of sacricial giving in v. </p>
<p>3. Hence, Wallace’s model is not entirely consistent. Moreover, since Paul </p>
<p>and the Corinthians’ tongues are not understood (see 14:2, 6, 15–16, 18), </p>
<p>and other Jews believe that humans could speak in heavenly languages (T. </p>

<p>156. Possibly, human tongues includes “new” tongues (Mark 16:17[A, TR]).</p>
<p>Tongues of angels is probably not hyperbole for eloquence; Paul associates eloquence </p>
<p>with wisdom (1:17; 2:1, 4). Perhaps he heard angelic voices during his third heaven </p>
<p>experience (2 Cor 12:3–4). On esoteric-angelic languages, see Poirier 2010:81–140. </p>
