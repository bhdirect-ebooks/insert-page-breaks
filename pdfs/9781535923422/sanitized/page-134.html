<p>the ultimate salvation of “we,” that is, those who believe in the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is through the Lord that reconciliation, righteousness, salvation, and the </p>
<p>triumph of resurrection takes place (15:21, 57; 2 Cor 5:18–19; Rom 5:18–21; </p>

<p>Paul arms that everything created will inevitably be put</p>
<p>in its proper order under God’s headship and dominion through the Lord </p>
<p>Jesus Christ (see 11:3; 15:27–28). </p>
<p>e Shema for the new creation is not merely a theological excursion </p>
<p>but also has ethical implications. e solidarity between God and the Lord </p>
<p>Jesus is an exemplary model for the Corinthians to imitate in terms of their </p>
<p>own solidarity as believers. Moreover, to know God is to love God and have </p>
<p>fellowship with God and Christ, which should result in knowing, loving, </p>
<p>and having fellowship with one’s neighbor.</p>
<p>Idol Foods and Weak Believers (8:7–13)</p>
<p>Even though Paul concedes with the strong members that there is no God </p>
<p>but one, he states that this knowledge is not in all believers, particularly </p>
<p>some who were formerly idolaters. Such members are accustomed to the </p>
<p>idol until now, that is, they have been in the habit of believing that the de-</p>
<p>ity representing the idol really exists. ey eat idol food as though (truly) </p>
<p>to an idol, with the implication that by doing so, they become aware of </p>
<p>performing a religious act to another god. Such believers are susceptible </p>
<p>to spiritual disaster. ey have a weak conscience (ἀσθενής συνείδησις),</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> </p>
<p>which can be deled, wounded, emboldened, and, most prominently, </p>
<p>prompt them to commit apostasy (8:7, 10, 12). Superstition may have char-</p>
<p>acterized these weak congregants,</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>and so fear of the gods and how they</p>
<p>might curse or hold them accountable may be their anxiety and concern. </p>
<p>A popular saying of the time was that nothing escapes notice of the gods </p>
<p>(eon Prog. 3[5]97). Pausanius provides a relevant example of how Cor-</p>
<p>inthians believed they could never escape the oaths that were made at the </p>
<p>temple of Palaemon (Descr. 2.2.1). If Garland is correct that conscience is </p>

<p>16. e precision of συνείδησις is evasive and perhaps best appreciated in light of </p>
<p>its respective context than our word choice. See discussion in iselton 2000:640–44. </p>
<p>Other renderings include “consciousness” or “self-awareness.” is conscience cannot </p>
<p>be reduced to having strong scruples against idol foods; otherwise, the weak should </p>
<p>be appalled rather than emboldened to participate with the strong in 8:10 (cf. Dawes </p>
<p>1998:90).</p>
