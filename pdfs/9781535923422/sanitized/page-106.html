<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>82</p>
<p>Sex with Prostitutes and the Corinthian Body (6:12–20)</p>
<p>e previous vice list includes fornicators, which now becomes the focus of </p>
<p>6:12–20. e problem in Corinth centers on congregation members hav-</p>
<p>ing sex with prostitutes.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>In a city like Corinth, apart from the brothels,</p>
<p>men could meet prostitutes almost anywhere, whether in the market place, </p>
<p>near a temple, or next to a government building (e.g., Dio Chrysostom Or </p>
<p>7.133–34).</p>
<p>83</p>
<p> Relevant for congregation members who were invited by un-</p>
<p>believers to dinners (10:27), banquets and symposiums were characterized </p>
<p>by gluttony, drunkenness, and promiscuity with prostitutes called heterai </p>
<p>(Plutarch Tu. san. 4[123E–F]; De esu II.2[997B–C]; Athenaeus Deipn. 13. </p>
<p>573C–574E).</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>Paul makes an appeal to advantage in which the audience</p>
<p>is persuaded to take a course of action in their best interest for future ben-</p>
<p>et.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>A diatribe pattern appears in this text that includes an interlocutor</p>
<p>who debates against the communicator (Paul).</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>Elements that stand out</p>
<p>include a Corinthian voice of worldly wisdom that contests Paul (6:12–13), </p>
<p>to which our apostle provides wise responses. Other stylistic features in-</p>
<p>clude anaphora (6:12) and the repetitive interrogative phrase, “Do you not </p>
<p>know?” (6:15, 16, 19), which attempts to dissuade through reason (logos). </p>
<p>e rst and last appearances of this question help create a chiasm with the </p>
<p>central point highlighting a scriptural quote:</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>A Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? (6:15a)</p>
<p>B Implicit sin against Christ (6:15b) </p>
<p>C Joining one body with a prostitute (6:16a)</p>
<p>D Scripture citation of two becoming one esh (6:16b)</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> Joining one Spirit with the Lord (6:16a, 17)</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Explicit sin against one’s body (6:18)</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit . . . ?</p>
<p>(6:19)</p>
