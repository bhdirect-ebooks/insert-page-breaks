<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>92</p>
<p>7:15 includes himself among those who have been abandoned. Being single </p>
<p>and celibate must be by way of concession as well since not everyone has </p>
<p>such a gi from God. God grants to some “the power to be continent in </p>
<p>sexual matters.”</p>
<p>131</p>
<p>is idea of giedness as a single person seems related</p>
<p>more to spiritual virtues, such as self-control (Gal 5:23), than to spiritual </p>
<p>gis such as in 12:4–12.</p>
<p>Paul briey addresses the unmarried and widows; the latter he re-</p>
<p>turns to in 7:39–40, and the former seem to be distinguished from virgins </p>
<p>in 7:25–38. e unmarried probably includes those of both sexes who </p>
were divorced prior to their conversion, widowers (if any), and those who
<p>had never been married but are not virgins, such as former fornicators </p>
<p>(6:9–11) and manumitted slaves who were once the unfortunate sex objects </p>
<p>of their masters. People in this group should remain celibate like Paul, but </p>
<p>if they cannot control themselves they should marry, for it is better to </p>
<p>marry than to burn with passionate sexual desire and thus be vulnerable </p>
<p>to fornication. When this thought is combined with 7:1–2, it becomes quite </p>
<p>evident that Paul considers any sex outside of marriage to be fornication, </p>
<p>including premarital sex as assumed here and again in 7:25–38. His advice </p>
<p>about burning desires would not sound too strange for Roman Corinthi-</p>
<p>ans who might be prompted to imagine from their traditions Queen Dido, </p>
<p>whose burning but deprived lust for Aeneas ends in her self-destruction </p>
<p>(Virgil Aen. 4.96–102, 642–705; Ovid Fasti 3.544–49). It was sometimes </p>
<p>thought inappropriate to show lust for one’s own wife, whereas it might </p>
<p>be permissible, especially among elitists, that a husband’s passions could </p>
<p>be vented through extra-marital sex (Demosthenes Or. [Neaer.]59.122; </p>
<p>Plutarch Conj. praec. 16[140B]). Against this, Paul’s advocacy for passion </p>
<p>in marital sex stands out.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>is reason for getting married, however,</p>
<p>may sound decient by today’s standards, but Paul is writing in an age </p>
<p>when marriages were typically arranged rather than singles freely dating </p>
<p>a number of prospects before falling in love with the “right” person. Paul </p>
<p>makes this statement attempting to curb sexual promiscuity in Corinth; it </p>
<p>is doubtful that he meant to say that burning sexual passion is the only, let </p>
<p>alone best, motivation for marriage.</p>

<p>131. BDAG 1081. Paul’s gi of celibacy along with his condemnation of homoeroti-</p>
<p>cism (6:9–11) and valuing slaves as people, not tools (7:21–23), undermines Marchal </p>
<p>2011:749–70, who thinks Paul had sex with the slave Onesimus.</p>
<p>132. See further Oropeza 2006:31–32; contrast Martin 1995:209–17 (critiqued by </p>
<p>Ellis 2007:147 –59). Similarly, Jewish sources also consider marital sex a preventative </p>
<p>against illicit sex (Prov 5:15–18; Tob 4:12; T.Lev. 9.9–10).</p>
