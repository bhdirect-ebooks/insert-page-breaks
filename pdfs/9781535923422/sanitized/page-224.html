<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>
<p>200</p>
<p>during the Feast of Unleavened Bread, two days aer the Paschal lamb is </p>
<p>slaughtered. He may have connected this oering and the sixteenth of Ni-</p>
<p>san with the same day Christ, the Paschal lamb (1 Cor 5:7), was risen. is </p>
<p>would be the third day.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e nal statement claims that the risen Christ appeared to many </p>
<p>(15:5–7). Bodily resurrection seems to preclude that these witnesses merely </p>
<p>dreamed or saw spiritual visions of Jesus.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> Unless prophetic and apoca-</p>
<p>lyptic texts were never read in synagogues, rst-century Jewish disciples </p>
<p>would seem to know the dierence between actually seeing a person and </p>
<p>merely having a vision or dream of that person. By these appearances Paul </p>
<p>means that Christ appeared to witnesses in a body that was recognizable </p>
<p>as their rabbi who had been crucied a few days earlier. First, he appeared </p>
<p>to Cephas (Peter), then the twelve disciples, though technically eleven if </p>
<p>Judas abandoned them, though it is not impossible that Paul also knew of </p>
<p>a tradition about Judas’s replacement (Acts 1:13–29).</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Paul seems to have</p>
<p>a tradition similar to Luke that declares the risen Lord had appeared in a </p>
<p>unique way to Peter (Luke 24:34; cf. Mark 16:7). John’s Gospel has Peter </p>
<p>visiting the empty tomb rst among the eleven (John 20:2–10; 21:1–19).</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Christ then appeared to more than ve hundred brothers and sisters. </p>
<p>No early source matches this number, though the witnesses in Matt 28:10 </p>
<p>is sometimes suggested.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> It seems that certain post-resurrection appear-</p>
<p>ances, though communicated orally, were never recorded in the Gospels. </p>
<p>is appearance, in any case, happens at one time and thus seems to rule </p>
<p>out visions, dreams, or hallucinations, which are subjective and happen to </p>
individuals rather than multitudes. Should any Corinthian wish to contest
<p>these witnesses, the majority of them are still alive when Paul writes this </p>
<p>letter over two decades later; they could conrm these claims. Paul does not </p>
<p>need to specify which James he means, presumably because the Corinthians </p>
<p>already know this is the “brother of the Lord” who as an apostle has seen </p>
<p>17. Cf. iessen 2012:389–90; White 2015:103–19.</p>
<p>18. e aorist passive ὤφθη probably means he “appeared” (BDAG 719[A.1.d.]). </p>
<p>e alternative “was seen” may also be used if not reduced to implying non-bodily </p>
<p>appearances.</p>
<p>19. On Judas, see 11:23 above.</p>
<p>20. Why doesn’t Paul name Mary Magdalene and other women witnesses as do the </p>
<p>Gospels? Oentimes in patriarchal societies men were considered the only reliable wit-</p>
<p>nesses (Aristotle Ath. Pol. 53.2; Josephus Ant. 4.219; Brown 2014:129–30). Although </p>
<p>Paul mentions women via the “brothers and sisters” in 15:5, since 15:3–11 functions </p>
<p>forensically with witnesses as inarticial proof (see above), perhaps he thought that his </p>
<p>auditors would not nd it any more persuasive for him to add Mary and the women’s </p>
<p>testimony (see also Gerhardsson 2003:82–83).</p>
<p>21. E.g., Schnabel 2006:892–93.</p>
