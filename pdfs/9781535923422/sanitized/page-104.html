<p>Fusing the Horizons: Christians, Homoeroticism, and Loving Your Neighbor</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>correct paradigm for his Gentile converts (Gal 2–3; 2 Cor 3), it appears that </p>
<p>he and other emergent Christians still afﬁrmed that the Levitical sex code </p>
<p>must be kept by Gentiles, the “aliens” who live among Israelites. In Acts </p>
<p>15:19–29, where this connection is established, fornication (πορνεία) may </p>
<p>be an umbrella term for various illicit sex acts in Leviticus 18:6–30.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>This</p>
<p>may be one reason why Paul rejects same-sex unions.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>For Paul, then, it</p>
<p>seems that μαλακός refers to the penetrated male and ἀρσενοκοίτης identiﬁes </p>
<p>the “bedding male” or the dominant partner who penetrates.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>The terms</p>
<p>in 6:9 identify both passive and dominant consenting partners of same-sex </p>
<p>eroticism.</p>
<p>In recent decades many attempts have been made to qualify Paul’s </p>
<p>words so that they do not suggest a denunciation of marital and commit-</p>
<p>ted same-sex relationships. Such attempts have been unsuccessful partly </p>
<p>because Paul does not make any distinctions that would preclude same-</p>
<p>sex marriage. As a ﬁrst-century Jew informed by traditional sexual values, </p>
<p>it is doubtful that, hypothetically speaking, Paul would have made such </p>
<p>qualiﬁcations if pressed on the issue.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>If our apostle promptly rejects a</p>
<p>monogamous incestuous relationship involving a church member in 5:1–5, </p>
<p>one suspects he would have also rejected a monogamous homosexual re-</p>
<p>lationship. The conclusion of William Loader’s extensive research on sex </p>
<p>in ancient Jewish and Christian worlds is sobering: “Nothing . . . indicates </p>
<p>that he is exempting some same-sex intercourse as acceptable. It is all an </p>
<p>abomination for Paul.”</p>
<p>80</p>
<p> Our contemporary discussions about sexual ori-</p>
<p>entation, then, would probably ring foreign to Paul. He believes that God’s </p>
<p>Spirit transforms those who come to Christ and is thus able to change any-</p>
<p>one’s sexual behavior (6:11), which is a point frequently ignored in current </p>
<p>discussions. He probably would perceive one’s tendency in this regard no </p>
<p>differently than the converted fornicator or alcoholic whose desires beckon </p>
<p>them on to resume their former urges. For Paul, such inclinations are to be </p>
<p>resisted and, with the Spirit’s power and Christ-community’s proactive as-</p>
<p>sistance, successful resistance could be achieved. We can speculate further </p>
<p>76. See Hays 1996:382–83.</p>
<p>77. He gives other reasons in Rom 1:26–27: such acts are unnatural and character-</p>
<p>ize human rebellion against God that venerate creature over Creator.</p>
<p>78. See Loader 2013:138; Via/Gagnon 2003:82–90; Soards 1999:126.</p>
<p>79. Commitment among same-sex partners was not unheard of in Paul’s world: see </p>
<p>sources in Gagnon 2001:384–85; Brooten 1996:140–41, 172, 242–43, 360–61. Nero </p>
<p>would soon have two same-sex marriages (cf. Cassius Dio 62.28, Tacitus Ann. 15.37).</p>
