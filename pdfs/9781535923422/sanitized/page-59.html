<p>and charged lucrative sums of money to speak (Isocrates,</p>
<p>Soph. 13.3–5; Themistius Or. 23.288-89).</p>

<p>They also encouraged strife,</p>
<p>disputes, and contests with other speakers (Dio Chrysostom, Or. 8.9; Phi-</p>
<p>lostratus, Vit. Soph. 2.576, 579–580, 586–88; Isocrates Soph. 14[Or. </p>
<p>13]; Plato, Protag. 335A). It is precisely this type of competitive nature, </p>
<p>boasting in rhetorical deliveries, and pandering to social prestige that Paul </p>
<p>comes against. The congregation seems to reﬂect the wisdom of this world </p>
<p>in this regard, and ironically resemble Epictetus’s description of a stun-</p>
<p>ning Corinthian student of the sophists whose primary concern centered on </p>
<p>his outward appearance instead of moral virtues (Diatr. 3.1). Such mores </p>
<p>inﬂuenced congregation members to evaluate Christian speakers amiss, and </p>
<p>this ultimately caused strife and thinking one person superior to another. </p>
<p>Pogoloff aptly explains Paul’s response in this situation: “In Paul’s narrative </p>
<p>world, the normal cultural narratives of eloquence and status are radically </p>
<p>reversed. What persuades is speech about what is ordinarily unﬁt for con-</p>
<p>templation: not a life which is cultured, wise, and powerful, but one marked </p>
<p>by the worst shame and the lowest possible status. Paul’s rhetoric of the </p>
<p>cross thus opposes the cultural values surrounding eloquence.”</p>

<p>Wisdom from God’s Spirit Rather Than Wisdom </p>

<p>Paul speaks of a wisdom that is not of this age nor of the rulers of this age. </p>
<p>is is God’s wisdom—it belongs to and comes from God—and in this text </p>
<p>it functions prominently in the mode of teaching revelatory discourse. e </p>

<p>conjunction “for” ve times (2:8, 10, 11, 14, 16).</p>
