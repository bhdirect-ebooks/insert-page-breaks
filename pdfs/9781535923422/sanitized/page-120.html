<p>Excursus: Unbelieving Spouses, Clean Children, and Pollution by Idols (7:14) </p>
<p>96</p>
<p>parents, they were probably taught by the unbelieving parent to pray to </p>
<p>and venerate other gods. The believing spouse also ate the same food at </p>
<p>the dinner table with the unbelieving spouse, food which might have been </p>
<p>dedicated to idols. This issue would be especially relevant for believers with </p>
<p>“weak” consciences (see 8:7–13). Since the Corinthians are taught that an </p>
<p>unbeliever’s body belongs to the fallen present age and realm of Satan (5:5; </p>
<p>6:12–20), might they infer from this that having sex with their unbelieving </p>
<p>spouses could pollute or otherwise jeopardize their own spiritual safety?</p>
<p>Paul’s answer to these believers would seem to be very comforting. Due </p>
<p>to the believing spouses’ presence in the home, the unbelieving spouses are </p>
<p>sanctiﬁed, which here probably means that they do not become a pollut-</p>
<p>ant through idols and the demons idols might attract (8:4–7; 10:20–21).</p>
<p>146</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Such powers are prevented from doing harm to believing spouses and their </p>
<p>children because they belong to Christ. God’s Spirit, who is more powerful </p>
<p>than other forces, will continue to be present in and favor such households, </p>
<p>and their prayers to God will not be hindered. The believer’s holiness ei-</p>
<p>ther becomes a contagion, or the unbeliever’s impurity is neutralized in the </p>
<p>“powerﬁeld” of God’s Spirit that protects their household.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>Paul, of course,</p>
<p>does not mean that unbelieving spouses are automatically saved or ﬁlled </p>
<p>with God’s Spirit; rather, these spouses are prevented from being pollutants </p>
<p>in their own households despite not being saved. Since the believer’s chil-</p>
<p>dren are holy, not polluted by idols or demons via the unbelieving spouse, </p>
<p>they could participate as members of the Christ community.</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>It follows</p>
<p>from this that they are permitted to eat at church meals that commemorate </p>
<p>the Lord’s Supper.</p>
<p>146. is consecration happens regardless of whether or not the unbelieving spous-</p>
<p>es behave like Christians (pace, Murphy-O’Connor 2009:43–57). e perfect passive </p>
<p>ἡγίασται (“sanctied”) and locative ἐν (“in the presence of”) suggest a state rather than </p>
<p>praxis. Similarly, though considering ἐν as instrumental, are Schrage 1994:2.105; Fee </p>
<p>1987:300.</p>
<p>147. On the former, see Hays 2002:251; on latter, Schnabel 2006:376. On trans-</p>
<p>ference of holiness in the LXX, see Ciampa/Rosner 2010:299. Dierently, Gillihan </p>
<p>2002:711–44, considers Paul to be saying that such marriages are holy by virtue of being </p>
<p>licit marriages (cf. m. Qidd. 2:1–3.12).</p>
<p>148. See Gillihan 2002:730.</p>
