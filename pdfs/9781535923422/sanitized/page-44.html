<p>Prothesis and Statement of Facts (1:10–17)</p>

<p>in Corinth likely argued that he was the better orator.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Paul does not</p>
<p>appear to have any problem with Apollos’ eloquent style; his problem is </p>
<p>with Corinthian evaluations of that style in competition with other styles, </p>
<p>such as his own. Comparisons of this sort provoke strife, arrogance, and </p>
<p>encourage status seeking, as explicated in chapters 1–4. Paul challenges </p>
<p>them instead with the radically dierent perspective that apostolic proc-</p>
<p>lamations are centered on weakness and humility characterizing Christ’s </p>
<p>crucixion, and they operate with Spirit-endowed wisdom (1:18—2:16).</p>
<p>Paul repeats the third claim I am of Cephas (Peter) again in 3:22,</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> </p>
<p>which steers us away from accepting the allegiance as purely invention. If </p>
<p>a faction relates to this leader it probably did not consist of many members; </p>
<p>otherwise, we might expect Paul to discuss Peter as much as he does Apollos </p>
<p>in later chapters (cf. 4:6). We can safely rule out the antiquated view that </p>
<p>the apostles from Jerusalem or proselytizers in the name of Peter stirred up </p>
<p>this contention in Corinth.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> Earlier discords that Paul experienced in Jeru-</p>
<p>salem and Antioch with the circumcision party and Peter (Gal 2:1–15) are </p>
<p>not problems in Corinth. If he were still in contention with Peter, we could </p>
<p>surmise that Paul would not have mentioned him favorably in 9:5 and 15:5. </p>
<p>A small minority of Corinthians may have regarded Peter’s apostleship to </p>
<p>be more authoritative than Paul’s because Peter knew the pre-Easter Jesus </p>
<p>personally and led the original witnesses (e.g., Acts 1–2). Perhaps he recently </p>
<p>visited Corinth with his wife and le a positive impression (9:4–5).</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Unlike the other claims, I am of Christ is not repeated again. Is Paul </p>
<p>referring to maverick members who reject all human leaders and listen only </p>
<p>to Christ, whether by adhering only to Jesus’s oral teachings or listening to his </p>
<p>words allegedly through visions, prophecy, or some other charismatic experi-</p>
<p>ence? is is possible, but given that Paul ultimately supports this allegiance </p>
<p>by arming that the Corinthians belong to Christ (3:23; 6:15, 20), it may </p>
<p>be better to suggest that this particular claim is Paul’s own invention.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>If so,</p>
<p>this is an ironic twist that ends the string of claims by redirecting Corinthian </p>
<p>thought to the perspective that all of them belong to Christ. is naturally </p>
<p>23. On Apollos’s eloquence, see Pogolo 1992:181–83; Winter 2002:178. More </p>
<p>speculatively, Welborn 2011:403–10, suggests that Apollos accepted nancial support </p>
<p>in Corinth, and Gaius was his patron. </p>
<p>24. “Peter” (Greek Petros), the name Jesus gave Simon (Matt 16:17–18), is equiva-</p>
<p>lent to the Aramaic Kepha’ according to Fitzmyer 2008:143.</p>

<p>27. Prothro 2014:250–65, argues from the grammatical sequence “μέν . . . δὲ . . . </p>
<p>δὲ . . .” in 1:12 that a break in the fourth claim, “I am of Christ” cannot be ruled out.</p>
