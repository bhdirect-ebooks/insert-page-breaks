<p>Introduction</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Roman Corinth</p>
<p>Aer Mummius’s conagration of Corinth, some structures and a small </p>
<p>population of primarily lower class Greeks remained.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Under Julius Caesar</p>
<p>it was repopulated in 44 BCE as a Roman colony. Surviving Greek buildings </p>
<p>were reused, such as the South Stoa, the theatre, the Peirene and Glauke </p>
<p>fountains, and the Isthmian games were reinstated.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> According to Benja-</p>
<p>min Millis, the population included Greek freedman, provincials, and Ro-</p>
<p>man freeborn; the amount of veterans was insignicant. e repopulated </p>
<p>city was neither completely Greek nor Roman but a hybrid culture.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>It</p>
<p>was comprised of both colonist citizens and foreigners, and its governance, </p>
<p>typical of Roman colonial cities, consisted of two magistrates (duoviri) who </p>
<p>appointed councilors (decuriones). In addition, two aediles were in charge </p>
<p>of edices, street maintenance, and commercial aairs. e most honored </p>
<p>position was the agonothetes, the president over the games.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Corinth</p>
<p>prospered especially as a service city that provided cultural, educational, </p>
<p>religious, and judicial activities.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Cicero called this large, thriving city the</p>
<p>“light of all Greece” (Leg. man. 5) and Diodorus Siculus the “bright star of </p>
<p>Hellas” (Bib. hist. 32.27.1). </p>
<p>Its civic reputation, along with many erections and inscriptions attest-</p>
<p>ing to human pride, may warrant Corinth as “a city where public boasting </p>
<p>and self-promotion had become an art form.”</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Although the lingua franca</p>
<p>of the time was Greek, and Latin was the elite language of Rome, the ma-</p>
<p>jority of inscriptions in Corinth are written in Latin prior to the second </p>
<p>century CE.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>is doubtless suggests the inuence of both Roman and high</p>
<p>society in Corinth. While Roman ideology was surely pervasive in Corinth, </p>
<p>legends attached to art and ancient structures provided its inhabitants with </p>
<p>a sense of continuity with the older Greek city. Elite magistrates with Greek </p>
<p>names uncovered in the city suggest not only that Greeks were becoming </p>
<p>more like Romans, but that “Corinth was becoming more Greek.”</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Unpoliced private cults ourished in the area enabling Greek and for-</p>
<p>eign religions to continue without harassment.</p>
