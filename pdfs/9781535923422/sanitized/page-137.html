<p>ird Supporting Proof (8:1—11:1)</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>10:7 and 14, the reality of weak believers falling away (2 Cor 11:29), and </p>
<p>Paul’s repeated use of idolatry in his vice lists relevant to the Corinthian </p>
<p>situation (5:9–10; 6:9–10; cf. 2 Cor 6:16), the reality of this activity is more </p>
<p>likely than not.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul’s words suggest that the dining area in the temple precinct is vis-</p>
<p>ible to those passing by, and the weak passer-by happens to see the strong </p>
<p>there. If portions of food were set on a table before a given deity, and the </p>
<p>deity’s statue stood near the recliners, it might be easily believed that the </p>
<p>deity was present at the dinner and sharing in the meal.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> But it is question-</p>
<p>able whether the food eaten by recliners ever touched the table,</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>and for the</p>
<p>strong who do not believe in deities, it would not matter even if it did. e </p>
<p>weak believer, however, draws religious conclusions about the recliners and </p>
<p>is thus encouraged to eat idol food aer perceiving that the strong believer </p>
<p>has done so. e strong eats based on knowledge that no other gods exist </p>
<p>except the one true God, but the weak does not have this knowledge, and so </p>
<p>he commits idolatry when eating and is tragically destroyed . . . the brother </p>
<p>for whose sake Christ died. is person’s faith is ruined as he abandons </p>
<p>the one true God to worship idol deities again, and this eventually results </p>
<p>in his condemnation on judgment day.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>In this situation Christ’s costly and</p>
<p>redemptive death for him turns out to be in vain.</p>
<p>By causing the weak to commit apostasy, the strong members wrong </p>
<p>these believers and sin against Christ who died for the weak brothers and </p>
<p>sisters. Paul’s unspoken premise here may be that Christ and the weak be-</p>
<p>lievers are united.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>is suggests solidarity as one body and may be similar</p>
<p>in thought to Christ’s own words when he rst appeared to Paul on the road </p>
<p>to Damascus—when Paul persecutes the church, he is persecuting Christ </p>
<p>(Acts 26:14–15). e thought also comes close to warnings against those </p>
<p>who neglect the least of Christ’s “brothers and sisters” (Matt 25:40, 45) and </p>
<p>those who ruin the faith of “little ones” that belong to him (Mark 9:42–49; </p>
<p>Luke 17:2; Matt 18:6–9).</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>Paul exhorts the strong members and encourages</p>
<p>them to follow his example—If food causes my brother to fall, I will never </p>
<p>eat meat again so that I will not cause my brother’s downfall. e strong </p>
<p>should be more concerned about the spiritual welfare of their weak broth-</p>
