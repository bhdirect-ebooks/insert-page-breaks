<p>ird Supporting Proof (8:1—11:1)</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>his call to preach is involuntary; he could only disregard it at the cost of his </p>
<p>own spiritual detriment. </p>
<p>In terms of reward, however, his proclamation of the gospel antici-</p>
<p>pates compensation from the Lord, though with diminishing returns if he </p>
<p>undermines his own policy to proclaim it free of charge. Paul’s role of being </p>
<p>entrusted as a steward administrator over the Lord’s territory (cf. 4:1), even </p>
<p>if performed involuntarily as a slave, still involves remuneration.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>His labor</p>
<p>will eventually result in a reward during the coming age (cf. 3:8, 14). Even </p>
<p>so, Paul is more concerned here about reward in the present. Since his gospel </p>
<p>is expedited through self-support, he is able to travel more frequently and </p>
<p>thus win more converts than he would if contingent on the slower process of </p>
<p>depending on others to support him (see 9:12 above). Hence, his boast and </p>
<p>reward foremost refer to the enjoyment of seeing a surplus of saved lives on </p>
<p>account of his preaching free of charge. is boon prevents him from taking </p>
<p>complete advantage of his right to live o of the gospel.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>All Things for the Gospel’s Sake (9:19–23)</p>
<p>Despite being free from all people Paul voluntarily makes himself a slave </p>
<p>to all in order to win as many as possible to salvation through the gospel.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul’s accommodation, however, has limits. He denies being disingenuous </p>
<p>or attering (1 ess 2:5; Gal 1:10; Rom 16:17–20). And he is motivated not </p>
<p>by the hope of upward social mobility but proclaiming the gospel, which is </p>
<p>the higher good to which freedom should submit, and salvation becomes </p>
<p>the supreme good.</p>
<p>70</p>
As such, Paul works with the language of divine “con-
<p>descension,” a “coming down to the level of” those he attempts to reach </p>
<p>(Philo Somn. 1.147; 1.232–33).</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> More importantly, as Troels Engberg-</p>
<p>Pedersen arms, he follows “Christ’s own practice in the Christ event. It is </p>
<p>67. See e.g. Matt 25:14–15; Goodrich 2012:182–84.</p>
<p>68. Καταχράομαι (“to make full use of” 9:18) intensies χράομαι (“to make use of” </p>
<p>9:15). Is there admittance that he sometimes uses this right? Perhaps this qualication </p>
<p>admits what the Corinthians might already know—Paul accepts money from other </p>
<p>churches (cf. 2 Cor 11:7–11; Garland 2003:427). Congregational maturity is one reason </p>
<p>why he could receive money from the Philippians (Phil 1:7; 4:10–19) but refuse it from </p>
<p>the Corinthians (see Oropeza 2016:606–13; Briones 2013:128–30, 219–24).</p>
<p>69. “at I might gain . . . ” is repeated ve times in 9:19–22, stressing this idea. In </p>
<p>9:19 “all” (πάντων) can refer to “all things” (Lindemann 2000:209–11) or “all people” </p>
<p>(Coppins 2011:279). e latter makes better contextual sense.</p>
<p>70. See Galloway 2010:23 for the former idea; Sandnes 2013:129, for the latter.</p>
<p>71. Cf. Mitchell 2001:205; cf. Glad 2003:35; Vollenweider 1989:217–20; Richard-</p>
<p>son/Gooch 1978:91–93. Nanos 2012:106–40 argues for “rhetorical adaptability,” which </p>
<p>I nd attractive, but (unlike Nanos) not to the point of exclusivity.</p>
