<p>Prothesis and Statement of Facts (1:10–17)</p>
<p>21</p>
leads to the rhetorical question Is Christ divided? e picture presented here
<p>invites the congregation to view its members in solidarity as one corporate </p>
body in Christ. Contrariwise their divisions evoke an image of Christ’s body
<p>being dismembered. e feet no longer claim to be part of the same body </p>
<p>with the hands. e ears no longer claim to be part of the same body with the </p>
<p>eyes. Christ’s limbs are being split apart.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>e rhetorical force of this question</p>
<p>thus prompts the response, “No, Christ is not split up!”</p>
<p>e subsequent questions and context of 1:13–17 recall the Corin-</p>
<p>thians’ conversion (1:2) and present the ironic image of Paul being cru-</p>
<p>cied for them and they being baptized into his name. ese questions </p>
<p>expect the reply, “No, it was Jesus, not Paul, who was crucied for us and </p>
<p>we are baptized in Jesus’s name!” Our apostle plays down the importance </p>
<p>of his own role by claiming that I baptized none of you except Crispus </p>
<p>and Gaius and the household of Stephanas (Acts 18:8; Rom 16:23; 1 Cor </p>
<p>16:17).</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>e households of Crispus and Gaius may be included though</p>
<p>not mentioned.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>Paul’s trivialization may suggest that members thought</p>
<p>themselves superior to others based on the prominence of the minister </p>
<p>who had baptized them.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>Perhaps in their new faith they still assumed</p>
<p>from mystery religions that ceremonies of initiation created a special bond </p>
<p>between the initiator and the one initiated.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>Prior to their conversion some</p>
<p>of them may have participated in such cults (cf. 12:2). e result in any </p>
<p>case spelled tragedy—one of the very things that united unrelated Jews and </p>
<p>Gentiles into one body as siblings in Christ had become a rallying point for </p>
divisions (1 Cor 12:13; Gal 3:27–28). is problem prompts Paul to make
<p>the unusual assertion that Christ sent me not to baptize but to proclaim </p>
<p>the gospel about Christ crucied. Exactly who he baptizes is unimport-</p>
<p>ant, for Paul is called to proclaim the gospel rather than perform baptisms </p>
<p>(9:16; 15:1; Gal 1:15–16; Rom 15:20).</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>is sense of priorities is important</p>
<p>for the Corinthians to know because they have a “tendency to magnify the </p>
<p>messengers and miss the message.”</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>28. Conversely, see 12:14–17. e passive μερίζω in 1:13 suggests being “split up”: </p>
<p>see LSJ 1103.</p>
<p>29. Nash 2009:18, provides a convenient list of Corinthian members.</p>
<p>30. Cf. Acts 18:8; Pascuzzi 2009:823–24.</p>
31. Another option is that the perpetrators of this division gave “special authority”
<p>to baptize only to certain leaders but not others: cf. Schottro 2012:720–21. </p>
<p>32. See Chester 2003:290, 303. </p>
<p>33. “For” in 1:17 refers to 1:16b and explains “that is not my calling—nor my point” </p>
<p>(Fee 1987:63).</p>
