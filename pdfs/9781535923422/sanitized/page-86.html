<p>so his exhibition of apostolic hardships is for an exhortational purpose that </p>
<p>combines familial and pedagogical discourse. An exaggerated ten thousand </p>
<p>tutors (παιδαγωγούς) mark the congregation’s teachers and visiting min-</p>
<p>isters who guide, protect, and provide them with moral education.</p>

<p>Paul</p>
<p>on the other hand claims to be their father—it was through the gospel he </p>
<p>proclaimed that they came to faith in Christ (Acts 18).</p>
<p>202</p>
<p>As their spiritual</p>
<p>parent he should be honored by them; parental honor may be assumed sec-</p>
<p>ond only to honoring God and perhaps country (Cicero O. 1.160; Ps.-Phoc. </p>
<p>8; cf. Sir 3:8–11; Eph 6:1–2).</p>
<p>203</p>
<p>A father like Paul is to be respected, imitated,</p>
<p>and should receive aection in reciprocity.</p>
<p>204</p>
<p> is assertion prompts dis-</p>
<p>cordant Corinthians to submit and be unied under the one household in </p>
<p>Christ in which Paul functions as their father.</p>
<p>205</p>
<p> Moreover, fathers are con-</p>
<p>sidered teachers of their children (Aristotle N.E. 8.12.5; Philostratus Vit. soph. </p>
<p>1.490),</p>
<p>206</p>
<p>as Benjamin Fiore arms, “e teaching in the school is considered</p>
<p>an extension of, or at least analogous to, the parent in the home.”</p>
<p>207</p>
<p>Part of</p>
<p>that teaching role was for children to imitate their parents by way of example, </p>
<p>which is how Paul exhorts the Corinthians: Be imitators of me. ey are to </p>
<p>follow the apostle’s servant-like and cruciform conduct in 3:5—4:13. </p>
<p>Rhetorical and philosophical training encouraged students by way of </p>
<p>imitation as well (Philostratus Vit. soph. 2.586–88; eon, Prog. 2.70–71; </p>
<p>Isocrates Soph. 13.17–18; Xenophon Mem. 1.2.3).</p>
<p>208</p>
<p> e example our apos-</p>
<p>tle promotes is subversive to the status-seeking ideology wed with imitating </p>
<p>sophist rhetoricians. Ben Witherington rightly notes that “Paul distinguishes </p>
<p>himself both from the sort of father gure the emperor might be and from </p>
<p>the sort other teachers, especially Sophists, might be, especially by means of </p>
<p>his hardship catalog.”</p>
<p>209</p>
<p>To imitate Paul is to imitate what is contrary to the</p>
<p>standards of the present age and its rulers—it embraces humility, suering, </p>
<p>and strength in weakness in Christ (4:10–13, 17). Paul, however, has the </p>

<p>phil. 3.92; Gal 3:24–25.</p>
<p>202. In 4:14, “not many fathers” may be an ironic understatement about Paul as </p>
<p>their one father in faith, or Paul concedes that God also used a few other missionaries </p>
<p>to convert them (e.g., 3:5).</p>
