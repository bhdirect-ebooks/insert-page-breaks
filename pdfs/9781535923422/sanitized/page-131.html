<p>Idol Foods, Idolatry, and Relinquishing One’s </p>
<p>Right: Third Supporting Proof (8:1—11:1)</p>
<p>In 8:1 now concerning introduces the next topic and possible inquiry from </p>
<p>the Corinthian letter received by Paul (cf. 7:1). is verse also functions </p>
<p>as the beginning of a third deliberative proof related to the letter’s central </p>
appeal for solidarity and against divisions (1:10). Apparently, some in the
<p>congregation have knowledge that idols are harmless and the deities they </p>
<p>represent are not real. ese members, identied by scholars as the strong </p>
<p>or gnosis (knowing), justify their consumption of food sacriced to idols.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other members who have a weak conscience can be harmed by their act.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e unity Paul deliberates here reconstructs knowledge and wisdom in a </p>
<p>way that caters to solidarity via strong members sharing love and consid-</p>
<p>eration for the weak. At the same time, he warns these members against </p>
<p>idolatry and partnering with demons. is threat is one in which insiders </p>
<p>risk spiritual pollution by becoming one with outsiders. e most basic con-</p>
<p>tours of 8:1—11:1 are as follows:</p>
<p>A Idol Foods and the Weak Believer (8:1–13)</p>
<p>B Relinquishing One’s Right (9:1–27)</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> Idolatry and Idol Foods (10:1—11:1)</p>
<p>Although a change in subject takes place at point B, the unity of these chap-</p>
<p>ters will be made evident.</p>
<p>Knowledge, Love, and One God and Lord (8:1–6)</p>
<p>Paul addresses the issue of things sacriced to idols (εἰδωλοθύτων), more </p>
<p>specically in this context meat has been oered (8:13; 10:25), though what </p>
<p>he says can pertain to other idol foods also (8:4, 8; 10:31).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>e statements,</p>
<p>1. Paul, however, does not use the word “strong” here except in 10:22. See also 4:10; </p>
<p>Rom 15:1. </p>
<p>2. On the history of interpretation in 1 Cor 8–10, see Willis 2007:103–12; Phua </p>
<p>2005:1–28; Fotopoulos 2003:1–47; Cheung 1999:306–22; Gooch 1993:135–55.</p>
<p>3. e term may be coined either by Jews (Arzt-Grabner et al. 2006:328) or early </p>
