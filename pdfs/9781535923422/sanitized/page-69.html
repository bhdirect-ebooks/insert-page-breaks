<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>presumably will take place when Christ returns; each person is accountable </p>
<p>for what they do (cf. 3:13; 4:1–5). </p>
<p>As Paul turns to the building metaphor, he also switches to an exhor-</p>
<p>tation with the imperative to be careful (3:10). He elicits pathos by warn-</p>
<p>ing them through a blend of priestly and apocalyptic images related to a </p>
<p>holy temple and end-time judgment. Believers in Christ must pay close </p>
<p>attention to their respective places related to this building. Asyndeton, </p>
<p>the omission of conjunctions (“and”), helps highlight the materials of the </p>
<p>project (3:12), and ery purication and destruction related to the end </p>
<p>of the age, along with a rhetorical question arming the auditors as this </p>
<p>building, which is a holy temple of God, contribute to the fear Paul wishes </p>
<p>to provoke. He presents himself as a wise master builder who laid the </p>
<p>foundation of this building by proclaiming the message of Christ cruci-</p>
<p>ed (cf. 2:2).</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>Our apostle perhaps assumes an early tradition that Christ</p>
<p>is the foundation of God’s assembly, which is viewed as an edice (Matt </p>
<p>16:16–18; Rom 9:32–33; cf. Isa 28:16; Ps 118:22).</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>Paul is the supervisor</p>
<p>of contractors involved in Corinthian temple construction. Such an edice </p>
<p>needed to pass an inspection that imposed penalties on those who failed </p>
<p>to build it according to agreed specications.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>Similar to the eld workers</p>
<p>this position leaves no ground for boasting since Paul laid the foundation </p>
<p>by the grace of God granted to him; credit goes not to the proclaimer but </p>
<p>the one proclaimed, who is Christ.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>Some interpreters suggest that in 3:10 the singular pronoun another is </p>
<p>a covert allusion to Apollos as the one who builds on Paul’s foundation, and </p>
<p>the warning of impending judgment in this passage hints at a problem Paul </p>
<p>has with this minister.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>However, the similar designation in this verse, each</p>
<p>one, doubtless includes all Christian teachers and laborers who are each </p>
individually responsible to pay attention to the way they build up the com-
<p>munity in Christ. Paul oen uses nameless third-person singulars in this </p>
<p>letter when warning multiple persons (e.g. 3:17; 10:12; 11:29; 14:38; 16:22).</p>

<p>111. Williams 2001:258–60, associates Isa 3:3 (σοφὸν ἀρχιτέκτονα) with 1 Cor </p>
3:10, but Isaiah declares that God will take away such a person from Judea in divine
<p>judgment, which is not how Paul presents himself. </p>

<p>113. Shanor 1988:461–71; Watson, 1992:35. Bitner 2015b:212–24 relates this build-</p>
<p>ing to construction politics.</p>
<p>114. See Schrage 1991:1.298; Garland 2003:115.</p>
<p>115. E.g., Ker 2000:89; Smit 2002:242. Bitner 2015b:265–71, combining inde-</p>
<p>nite pronouns in this text, suggests this is Crispus, Apollos’s alleged advocate. Barrett </p>
<p>1968:91, believes Cephas’s party is in view.</p>
