<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>

<p>with such persons because this meaning “ts the context better than either </p>
<p>have nothing to do with (are they to cut them dead in the street?) or not </p>
<p>to associate with (should they check what meetings or functions they at-</p>
<p>tend?). . . . Paul calls for discrimination about boundary markers, corporate </p>
<p>identity, and the recognition of the Christian community as a corporate </p>
<p>witness to overt beliefs, values, and lifestyles.”</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>Vice-doers who claim to be</p>
<p>fellow believers should be made well aware of the congregation’s position </p>
<p>about their behavior, and outsiders should not get confused into thinking </p>
<p>that such vices are approved by the church.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>It is one thing if the church</p>
<p>imposes its values on the world; quite another when the world imposes its </p>
<p>values on the church and the church passively accepts that imposition.</p>
<p>Paul charges the Corinthians not to eat with this type of person.</p>

<p> Jon-</p>
<p>athan Schwiebert has problems with versions of 5:11 that translate the pro-</p>
<p>hibition μηδέ as “not even” to eat with such a person (e.g., ESV, NRSV, NIV). </p>
<p>is makes the exclusion drastic and “the substance of the exclusion into an </p>
<p>insulting metaphorical gesture.”</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>He suggests instead the rendition: “As it is,</p>
<p>I wrote to you not to associate—if someone (nom.) who is called a brother </p>
<p>should be a pornos (nom.) [etc.] . . . —nor to eat with such a person.”</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>ramication of this translation is that the congregation’s disassociation with </p>
<p>the vice-doer in 5:9 is more closely linked with its refraining from table </p>
<p>fellowship with this person in 5:11. Are the congregants being discouraged </p>
<p>from eating with other believers in idolatrous settings (8:9–13)? Are they to </p>
<p>treat drunken members at the Lord’s Supper this way (11:21)? If corporate </p>
<p>shunning is being emphasized, then the vice-doers of 5:10–11 seem to be </p>
<p>shunned foremost from eating at the Lord’s Supper and other church meals. </p>
<p>Kenneth Bailey appropriately writes, “Paul is saying that mixing with sin-</p>
<p>ners in the pagan world is not the same as mixing with them in the body of </p>
<p>Christ and at the Eucharist. e very identity of the church is at stake in the </p>
<p>l att e r.”</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>e importance of table fellowship for emergent Christians should</p>
<p>not be underestimated, since it is among the most forceful expressions of </p>
