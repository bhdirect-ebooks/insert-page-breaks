<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>178</p>
<p>of “pseudo-language.”</p>
<p>195</p>
<p>at Paul identies the content of tongues with</p>
<p>“words” in 14:19 may suggest something more than sub-linguistic utter-</p>
<p>ances or groanings as in Rom 8:26–27.</p>
<p>196</p>
<p> In this chapter, if tongues are hu-</p>
<p>man foreign languages, they must be very unique ones. More plausibly, they </p>
<p>are “new” languages (Mark 16:17[A, TR]), or angelic languages (13:1b), or </p>
<p>a combination of these.</p>
<p>Paul’s I wish you all to speak in tongues does not necessitate that ev-</p>
<p>eryone does or should have this gi. Since the Corinthians already excel in </p>
<p>it, Paul concedes to its value,</p>
<p>197</p>
<p>and he tries to build rapport with them this</p>
<p>way so as to be more persuasive when saying, even more I wish you would </p>
<p>prophesy. Prophecy is preferred over tongues since it is comprehensible </p>
<p>and thus benecial for the edication (14:5, 12, 26) and exhortation (Rom </p>
<p>15:4; Heb 13:22) and consolation of church members (1 ess 2:12; 5:14). </p>
<p>Important prophetic aims include the advancement of ethical conduct and </p>
<p>deeper understanding of the confessed gospel.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p>e extra-natural aspect of</p>
<p>this gi seems emphasized (e.g., 14:24–25) in which words are “given by the </p>
<p>Spirit in a particular situation and ceases when the words cease.”</p>
<p>199</p>
<p>e rst instance of brothers and sisters in this chapter helps delineate </p>
<p>a structural turn in which the conditional conjunction ἐάν (normally “if”) </p>
<p>plays a signicant role. It appears seven times in 4:6–19 and oen guides </p>
<p>hypothetical questions that prompt auditors to agree with Paul’s reasoning. </p>
<p>His rst question asks whether it would benet them if I came speaking </p>
<p>in tongues. e expected answer is that he would not benet them unless </p>
<p>he were to use an intelligible speech gi such as revelation . . . knowledge </p>
<p>. . . prophecy or teaching (4:6; cf. 12:8, 10, 28).</p>
<p>200</p>
<p>He then poses two more</p>
<p>questions regarding the musical instruments of ute . . . lyre . . . trumpet.</p>
<p>201</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e anticipated answers are that if these instruments fail to make distinctive </p>
<p>sounds, it will not be known what is being played and, for the trumpet, no </p>
<p>one will prepare for war. In essence, unless musical sounds have recogniz-</p>
<p>able melodies, they are similar to the modern analogy of a cat walking on a </p>
<p>piano. Similarly, a fourth question poses that unless the Corinthians utter </p>
<p>195. E.g., Keener 2011:1.328–29, documents a number of modern cases of the mi-</p>
<p>raculous use of foreign languages similar to Acts 2:1–11.</p>
<p>196. See Ciampa/Rosner 2010:695.</p>

<p>199. Dunn 1975:228.</p>
<p>200. ough “revelation” is not named as a gi, it perhaps refers to the word of </p>
<p>wisdom (see 12:8) or more generally as any Spirit-prompted speech (14:26–30).</p>
<p>201. is rst two are found in 1 Sam[Kgdms]10:5 and in religious Hellenistic </p>
<p>practices (Collins 1999:496). On the trumpet’s use in the LXX, see Hiu 2010:57.</p>
