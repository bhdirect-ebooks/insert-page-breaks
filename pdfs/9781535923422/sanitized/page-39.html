<p>Introduction (1:1–9)</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Christ, which not only reects their being set apart as a holy people but also </p>
<p>their becoming partners with Christ, the one who died for them and now </p>
<p>shares a dynamic relationship with them. ey can be assured that God is </p>
<p>faithful to the saints and will bring to pass the anticipated second coming of </p>
<p>Christ and nal salvation pertaining to it. </p>
<p>Minus Paul’s attempt to win the goodwill of his recipients in this </p>
<p>section, I suspect the apostle would qualify more explicitly that the con-</p>
<p>gregation’s blamelessness on judgment day is contingent on its members </p>
<p>persevering in faith (see Col 1:22 –23). It will become clear in the remainder </p>
<p>of this letter that the opening verses provide no guarantee that every indi-</p>
<p>vidual who once had faith will necessarily receive nal salvation, let alone be </p>
<p>declared blameless, at the second coming if he or she abandons that faith or </p>
<p>lives an unrepentant and immoral lifestyle that desecrates one’s confession.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Final salvation will be the inevitable outcome for those who are “in Christ” </p>
<p>(1:2, 4; cf. v. 9), that is, those who belong to and remain in the corporate </p>
<p>body of Christ, maintaining spiritual fellowship with him. As we will notice </p>
<p>in this letter, among the destructive vices threatening the Corinthians’ new </p>
identity are divisions, idolatry, and fornication. ey are also inuenced by
<p>the ideology of Roman elitism and civic identity, which are set in opposi-</p>
<p>tion to the message of the cross.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>It will turn out that Paul’s commendation</p>
<p>of God working through the Corinthians with regard to their knowledge, </p>
<p>speech, charismatic gis, and prospective nal salvation sets him up to ex-</p>
<p>hort and correct them on these very issues later on in the letter.</p>
