<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>94</p>
<p>e apostle imparts no saying from Jesus here but gives his own per-</p>
<p>spective on the matter. First, the believer, whether husband or wife, should </p>
not divorce the unbelieving spouse if the unbeliever still consents to live
<p>with them. e unbeliever in this circumstance obviously tolerates the </p>
<p>spouse’s new religion and ethical conduct, which includes the worship of </p>
<p>only one God. Second, in such relationship the unbeliever does not con-</p>
<p>taminate the believer but is sanctied, made holy, in the presence of the </p>
<p>believing spouse. Related to this, the couple’s children are not unclean but </p>
<p>holy. Holiness here is probably best understood against the background of </p>
<p>believers and their children being potentially contaminated by the unbeliev-</p>
<p>ing spouses’ idolatry (see Excursus). ird, if the unbelieving spouse gets </p>
<p>separated from (i.e., leaves) the believer, the believer is not under bond-</p>
<p>age in such cases. e spouse who was abandoned is no longer enslaved to </p>
<p>the abandoner and is thus freed from that marriage. In the Greco-Roman </p>
world, if a person leaves a marriage, this constitutes “divorce by separation.”
<p>138</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although Paul would doubtless recommend celibacy for a believer who is </p>
divorced by an unbeliever, the option to remarry is permissible in keeping with the language of being “bound” or “free” from divorce contracts (m. Git.
<p>9.3; P. Mur. 19; cf. 1 Cor 7:39; Rom 7:2).</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>Fourth, the general principle in</p>
<p>all this is that God has called us to peace.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>is reects the end of strife in</p>
<p>a marriage that has conicting values, beliefs, and deities; peace is now pos-</p>
<p>sible because the unbeliever has departed. As well, the believer could have </p>
<p>peace of mind about the broken relationship and move on with his or her </p>
<p>life. Abusive marriages, incidentally, would also be contrary to such peace </p>
<p>even though Paul does not explicitly mention domestic violence.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p> </p>
Paul permits divorce and remarriage here based on a unique situation
<p>that is not found in Gospels. is perhaps lends credibility to the idea that </p>
the Gospels do not record all potential circumstances related to divorce and
<p>remarriage. ey provide boundaries upon which later Christian leaders </p>
<p>might build and discern the most prudent course of action to take rela-</p>
<p>tive to counseling their own married parishioners. Paul ends this subject by </p>
<p>138. Instone-Brewer 2002:190; Ciampa/Rosner 2010:292, 305–6; Treggiari </p>
<p>1991a:31–46. Similarly, in Jewish thinking (Exod 21:10–11), the wife is free to leave the </p>
<p>marriage if her spouse neglects to provide her with material necessities and fulll his </p>
<p>marital duties, such as have sex with her. On the danger of broadening or restricting </p>
<p>Paul’s words in relation to this thought, see Ciampa/Rosner 2010:293–94 (fn. 115).</p>
<p>139. See Keener 2005:65; Loader 2013:90.</p>
<p>140. ἡμᾶς (“us”) has stronger manuscript witnesses than ὑμᾶς (“you”): see Fee </p>
<p>1987:297. </p>
<p>141. Household peace would seem to mandate direct intervention and/or separa-</p>
<p>tion from the abusive spouse.</p>
