<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>
<p>203</p>
<p>What may have instigated this denial is that certain members had </p>
<p>recently died (11:30), and other members expected them to rise again </p>
<p>like Jesus. When this did not happen, they doubted bodily resurrection. </p>
<p>ey could accept that deication and bodily immortality may be for he-</p>
<p>roes like Jesus, Hercules, and Achilles. ey doubtless heard stories that </p>
<p>Asclepius became a god when Zeus struck him with lightning aer Hades </p>
<p>complained that the dead are diminishing due to Asclepius’s cures raising </p>
<p>them back to life.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>Some also surely heard that Romulus, founder of Rome,</p>
<p>vanished before death to be seen again as the god Quirinus; this belief was </p>
<p>accepted by the masses (Plutarch, Rom. 27.3–28).</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> But such transforma-</p>
<p>tions, the Corinthians supposed, were for special heroes rather than regu-</p>
<p>lar people like themselves who become bodiless shades at death (Homer, </p>
<p>Od. 11; Virgil, Aen. 6).</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>Such a belief would seem to be more acceptable for</p>
<p>common folks like the Corinthians than elite philosophical speculations </p>
<p>about the soul inhabiting another body aer death (Plato, Phaedr. 245C–</p>
<p>249D) or being absorbed at the conagration of all things (Epictetus, Diatr. </p>
3.13.4–5). ough given their diverse opinions, other members might be-
<p>lieve that at death the soul escapes the body forever to live in the heavens </p>
<p>and/or be set among the stars (e.g., Josephus, Bell. 6.46–47). At all events </p>
<p>since the dead bodies of believers were probably cremated, as was oen </p>
<p>done in Corinth, this likely raised more doubts among the congregants that </p>
<p>such bodies could return from the ashes.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Doubtless their denial increased</p>
<p>ris in the church, especially with the some who agreed with Paul’s view of </p>
<p>bodily resurrection.</p>
<p>Having presented inarticial proofs of Scripture and witnesses to </p>
<p>the resurrection of Christ, Paul turns to the articial proof of argumenta-</p>
<p>tion. He demonstrates that rejecting the resurrection leads to preposterous </p>
<p>ramications (15:12–19). ese arguments exhibit disadvantages related to </p>
<p>denying the resurrection.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>e rhetorical proof type he uses is logos, which</p>
<p>32. See Diodorus Siculus Bib. hist. 4.71.1–4; Pausanius Descr. 2.26.5–6; 2.27.4; </p>
<p>Homer Il. 2.729–33; Sextus Empiricus Prof. 1.261–62; Endsjø 2009:48, 57–58.</p>
<p>33. Plutarch (an elite Platonist), however, doubts the fable along with a few simi-</p>
<p>lar stories. See more examples in Endsjø 2009; 2008:417–36; Oropeza 11/2016, and </p>
<p>Introduction.</p>
<p>34. Brown 2014:79–107, 233, opts for this view rightly evincing bodily immortality </p>
<p>through Greco-Roman myths.</p>
<p>35. On cremation in Rome and Corinth, see Pliny Nat. 7.53[52]; 55[54]; Cicero </p>
<p>Leg. 2.57; omas 2005:286–88, 301–2; Walbank 2005:261, 270. Similarly, Endsjø </p>
<p>2009:155–58, suggests the Corinthians would disbelieve that mangled and decompos-</p>
<p>ing bodies could be raised again.</p>
<p>36. Appeals to disadvantage characterize deliberative discourse (iselton </p>
<p>2000:1214), and yet articial proofs in this context highlight forensic rhetoric, thus </p>
