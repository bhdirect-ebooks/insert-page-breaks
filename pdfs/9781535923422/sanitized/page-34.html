<p>Introduction</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>to which Paul responds in 1:11; 5:1; 7:1; 8:1; 12:1; 15:12; 16:1; and 16:12. </p>
<p>In terms of rhetorical arrangement, the supporting proofs of the prothesis </p>
<p>in 1:10 include 1:18—4:21; 5:1—7:40; 8:1—11:1; 12:1—14:40; 15:1–58; and<span class="_ _1" /> </p>
<p>16:1–12. e reader may wish to consult these sections for further under-</p>
<p>standing, and see the complete outline above. Paul, at any rate, is dealing with </p>
<p>a unique set of problems in Corinth, and he must respond to specic issues. </p>
<p>He is more concerned about the congregation’s moral and spiritual state than </p>
<p>orchestrating a one-tracked, perfect piece of rhetoric on bodily solidarity. </p>
<p>Our apostle is foremost a minister of the gospel who, to be sure, attempts to </p>
<p>persuade his recipients to accept and enact on his words, but at the same time </p>
<p>he trusts ultimately in the Spirit of God for the power, wisdom, and guidance </p>
<p>necessary to lead his recipients to that acceptance.</p>
