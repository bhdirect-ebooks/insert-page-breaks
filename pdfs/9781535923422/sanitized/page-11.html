<p>Preface</p>
<p>It might seem strange that this commentary arrives at the heels of an-</p>
<p>other one I completed on 2 Corinthians for SBL Press last year (Exploring </p>
<p>Second Corinthians; RRA 3; 2016), but my work on the Corinthian corre-</p>
<p>spondence in reverse order actually enabled me to see things a bit dier-</p>
<p>ently than I would otherwise. For instance, I may not have fully appreciated </p>
<p>the development of wisdom tendencies in the congregation without doing </p>
<p>2 Corinthians rst and addressing relevant problems related to sophistry </p>
<p>within that correspondence. My goal in this user-friendly commentary </p>
<p>on 1 Corinthians is to provide the reader, whether student or minister or </p>
<p>scholar (who can also benet from this up-to-date interpretation and its </p>
<p>many footnotes), with a fresh reading of the letter based on my studies and </p>
<p>recent scholarship. In keeping with my intertextual interests, I have tried to </p>
<p>concentrate at least on the clearer references Paul makes to Scripture and </p>
<p>other sources, and from there hopefully provide helpful insights.</p>
<p>I would like to thank a number of people who, whether directly or </p>
<p>indirectly, have helped with this project. ose deserving mention include </p>
<p>omas Brodie and Linda L. Belleville, who at the annual Society of Biblical </p>
<p>Literature conferences chaired the eological Interweaving of Scripture </p>
<p>in 1 Corinthians Seminar. As a steering committee member of this semi-</p>
<p>nar, I was enabled to read and hear the most recent scholarly papers on 1 </p>
<p>Corinthians. anks also goes to my Azusa Pacic University colleagues, </p>
<p>including Robert Duke (dean of the School of eology), Kenneth Waters </p>
<p>(associate dean), Federico Roth (interim chair of Biblical and Religious </p>
<p>Studies), Kay Higuera Smith (former chair), and Scott Daniels (former </p>
<p>dean). ey endorsed time o from my teaching load through our school’s </p>
<p>Teacher-Scholar award, and through the Center for Research on Ethics and </p>
<p>Values (CREV) headed by Mark Eaton. anks also goes to Donald Isaak, </p>
<p>executive director of the Oce of Research and Grants, for heading the </p>
<p>writer’s retreat I attended in Malibu, California (2015–16). </p>
<p>I would also like to thank my beautiful wife Vonda, who assists me </p>
<p>with some of the menial tasks that are part of writing and publishing. Fi-</p>
<p>nally, I would like to thank Michael Bird and Craig Keener for inviting me to </p>
<p>contribute to the New Covenant Commentary Series several years ago, and </p>
<p>who patiently waited as I cut the length of my manuscript by one-third to </p>
