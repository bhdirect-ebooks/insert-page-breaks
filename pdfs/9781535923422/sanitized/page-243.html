<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>
<p>219</p>
<p>to the faithful who are alive when Christ returns? How could they be resur-</p>
<p>rected if they have never died?” Paul responds that esh and blood are </p>
<p>not able to inherit the kingdom of God, neither does the perishable in-</p>
<p>herit imperishable. Humans in their current perishable bodies are unt </p>
<p>for God’s kingdom; their bodies must be transformed into imperishable </p>
<p>bodies. “Flesh and blood” is idiomatic for living as “frail and sinful human </p>
<p>beings” (Gal 1:15–16; Matt 16:17; 17:31).</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>More specically Paul deploys</p>
<p>the phrase in a way that conveys God’s decree on Adam (Gen 3:17–19; Sir </p>
<p>14:17–18). It connotes the human body as perishable, belonging to the old </p>
<p>creation in Adam. is state is juxtaposed with the imperishable risen body </p>
<p>t for the new creation in Christ. is body is not comprised of immate-</p>
<p>rial spirit but an immortal body animated by the Spirit.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>Paul’s mention</p>
<p>of God’s kingdom is perhaps informed by the underlying context of Isa 25, </p>
<p>which he quotes in 15:54—the larger context places this victory over death </p>
<p>during the Lord’s future reign (Isa 24:23).</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>is section also structurally</p>
<p>recapitulates earlier imagery related to Christ’s dominion and reign over all </p>
<p>things, including death (15:23–28).</p>
<p>Our apostle continues that the bodies of those who are alive will be </p>
<p>transformed at the second coming of Christ: we will not all sleep, but we </p>
<p>will all be changed. e rst person plural “we” might suggest that some of </p>
<p>his auditors and perhaps Paul himself are expected to survive until Christ </p>
<p>returns. is perspective, however, conicts with 6:14 and 2 Cor 4:14 which </p>
<p>assume that “we” will die and then be raised again. Such tensions give the </p>
<p>impression that Paul does not know whether he and his recipients will be </p>
<p>alive or dead at Christ’s return. If he is familiar with an oral tradition of </p>
<p>Jesus’s thief in the night discourse (1 ess 5:1–11; cf. Matt 24:36–51; Mark </p>
<p>13:32–37), perhaps he is also familiar with the saying that no one knows </p>
<p>when Jesus will return (Matt 24:36; Mark 13:32–33; cf. Acts 1:7).</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>is is</p>
<p>compatible with Paul speaking in a mystery, something known by God and </p>
<p>disclosed by his messengers, which assumes that normally speaking such </p>
<p>futuristic knowledge is kept hidden. In 15:51, then, “we” may be inclusive </p>
<p>of all of Christ’s followers. Whether alive or dead at the time of the Parou-</p>
<p>sia, every believer’s body will be changed. eir identities are persevered </p>
<p>107. Johnson 2003:304. e rst half of 15:50 is thus more or less explained in the </p>
<p>second half (Wright 2003:359).</p>
<p>108. ough Paul does not use the language, his view may be compatible with the </p>
<p>idea that esh in Adam is not the same as resurrected esh (cf. Luke 24:39).</p>
<p>109. See Wilk 2005:146–47.</p>
<p>110. His later brushes with death and imprisonment likely forced him to think even </p>
<p>more soberly of the strong possibility that he might die before Christ returns (2 Cor </p>
<p>1:8–11; Phil 1:20–24).</p>
