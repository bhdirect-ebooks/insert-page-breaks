<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>

<p>times (Matt 24:7; Mark 13:8; Luke 21:11; cf. 4 Ezra 16.18; Rev 6:8; 18:8). </p>
<p>One the other hand, we may not be privy to the nature of the distress. For </p>
<p>Paul, in any case, Christ’s rst advent is itself a sign of the prophetic turn of </p>
<p>ages. Since then, the time of the old creation has been drawn in together </p>
<p>with the time of the new creation so that these eras collide and overlap, </p>
<p>with the latter supplanting the former completely at Christ’s second ad-</p>
<p>vent (7:29; cf. 10:11).</p>
<p>180</p>
<p>Time in the present age, then, is limited; it cannot</p>
<p>continue indenitely.</p>
<p>181</p>
<p> If the institutes of the old creation, including mar-</p>
<p>riage, will eventually pass away, then to hold on too tightly to such things </p>
<p>is inadvisable. Moreover, Paul perhaps agrees with apocalyptic discourses </p>
<p>that discourage marriages due to end time calamities (4 Ezra 16.33–34; 2 </p>
<p>Bar. 10.13–14; Rev 18:23; cf. Joel 2:16; Jer 16:1–4).</p>
<p>182</p>
<p>In light of Paul’s “now</p>
<p>and not yet” perspective of the ages, the antithetical statements in 7:29–32, </p>
<p>guided by the phrase as though not, are to pervade the believers’ way of </p>
<p>thinking about marriage, weeping, rejoicing, purchasing, and anything else </p>
<p>that might make use of this world in the present era. His inclusion of re-</p>
<p>joicing and weeping on this list, which are valued human emotions in their </p>
<p>own right, probably views them relative to purchasing worldly goods (cf. </p>
<p>Ezek 7:12).</p>

<p> e present way of life with its preoccupations and socioeco-</p>
<p>nomic order will come to an end.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e second reason Paul wants virgins to remain as they are centers on </p>
<p>his desire for them to be free of concern so that they might be constantly in </p>
<p>service to the Lord without distraction (7:32, 35). Jesus similarly encour-</p>
<p>ages his disciples not to be concerned about daily necessities. He warns them </p>
<p>against becoming unfruitful due to the cares of this world (Matt 6:25–28; </p>
<p>13:22; Mark 4:19). Certain Stoics and Cynics who speculated on marriage </p>
<p>armed that, at least for some in the pursuit of wisdom, marriage can be </p>
<p>a distraction (e.g., Epictetus Diatr. 3.22.69–72; Diogenes Ep. 47; Diogenes </p>
<p>Laertius Vit. phil. 6.2.54).</p>
<p>185</p>
<p>Although a philosophically unperturbed state</p>
<p>in which one is detached from distracting things might resonate with Paul, </p>
<p>iselton rightly distinguishes the apostle’s nuance: “Trust in God relativizes </p>
<p>all other concerns; it does not ‘detach’ the Christian believer from them.”</p>
