<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>185</p>
<p>idealistically speaking, everyone prophesies and outsiders visit the church, </p>
<p>such a person is convicted by all, and called into account by all because the </p>
<p>secrets of his heart are revealed. But this does not happen as a result of all </p>
<p>the prophets directing their prophecies to the outsider. Rather, the outsider </p>
<p>overhears prophecy in the church, is inwardly convicted by what is heard, </p>
<p>and realizes that God may be indirectly speaking to him. is causes the </p>
outsider to fall on his face, suggesting reverence before the divine presence
<p>because of a miracle or manifestation (Gen 17:3; Num 16:22; 1 Kgs 18:39). </p>
<p>e person will then worship God declaring that “God is really among </p>
<p>you!” Paul may have derived the expression from prophetic passages that </p>
<p>depict foreigners making similar declarations of belief (see above). Espe-</p>
<p>cially relevant is Isa 45:14, which depicts restoration in which the nations </p>
<p>will acknowledge God. When we combine this thought with the picture be-</p>
<p>hind Isa 28, it turns out that tongues points to judgment and exile of God’s </p>
<p>people, whereas prophecy points to their restoration inclusive of Gentiles.</p>
<p>233</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul’s interpretation is mission driven.</p>
<p>234</p>
<p>Since the outsider is convinced of</p>
<p>God’s presence in the congregation, he would doubtless believe the gospel </p>
<p>message. One nds a similar pattern at Pentecost in Acts 2:5–13 when some </p>
<p>in the crowd did not understand the meaning of the tongues and became </p>
<p>mockers.</p>
<p>235</p>
<p>It was not until Peter explains the phenomenon that the crowd</p>
<p>was convicted and converted to faith in Christ (2:37–41; cf. 2:14–36). It is </p>
<p>rather likely that Paul had taught the Corinthians oral traditions related to </p>
<p>such apostolic use of tongues.</p>
<p>236</p>
<p>Since this congregation excelled in the gi,</p>
<p>members almost certainly would have asked him about its origin, and Paul </p>
<p>was probably not the originator of its use; but those who were apostles be-</p>
<p>fore him were.</p>

<p>Orderly Speech Gifts When Coming Together (14:26–40)</p>
<p>is chapter’s third mention of brothers and sisters begins a pericope guid-</p>
<p>ed by Paul’s instructive commands. His rst imperative provides a guiding </p>
<p>principle for the discourse (14:26). e following set of imperatives give </p>
<p>protocols on tongues (14:27–28) and the next set on prophecy (14:29–33), </p>
<p>and the next on the silencing of wives (14:34–35). e authority behind his </p>

<p>tecost manifestations.</p>
