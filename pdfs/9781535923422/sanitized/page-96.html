<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>

<p>e signicance of corporate shunning in this</p>
<p>regard preserves the purity and identity of the community. is judgment </p>
<p>is perhaps similar to the punishment against unruly and idle congregants </p>
<p>in 2 ess 3:14–15. Likewise, violators in the Qumran community were ex-</p>
<p>cluded from the community’s meal (1QS 6.24; 7.25; 8.16–18). But whereas </p>
<p>Qumran brings out a shared punishment for anyone who sympathizes with </p>
an ostracized member (4Q266 11.14–15), Paul does not threaten individu-
<p>als who, apart from church fellowship, might continue communicating with </p>
<p>the oender.</p>

<p>Fusing thE horizons: Mingling With vicE-DoErs toDay</p>
<p>What is our responsibility when it comes to associating with those whose </p>
<p>lifestyles contradict basic moral principles? On the one hand, Paul discour-</p>
<p>ages the Corinthians from associating with those who commit sexual immo-</p>
<p>rality and other vices; on the other, Jesus ate and drank with “sinners,” and </p>
<p>was criticized by his opponents because of it (Matt 9:9–13; 11:19; Mark </p>
<p>2:15–17; Luke 5:30–32; 15:1–2; 19:10). This alleged tension is specious, </p>
<p>however, when we hear Joseph Fitzmyer’s explanation: “Jesus’ reason is </p>
<p>explained: ‘I came not to summon the righteous, but sinner’ i.e., those who </p>
<p>could be converted to his cause. Paul’s principle, however, is different: it </p>
<p>concerns the purity of the Christian community, tainted unfortunately by the </p>
<p>moral failure of one who is already a convert.”</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>Kenneth Bailey expresses</p>
<p>this sentiment on a practical level: “When I mix with people in the ofﬁce </p>
<p>or shop who have no faith, the identity of my Christian community is not </p>
<p>threatened. But ‘mixing up together’ as the body of Christ, for Paul, was a </p>
<p>very different matter.”</p>
<p>42</p>
<p> The main distinction, then, centers on Paul shun-</p>
<p>ning vice-doers who already claim to be fellow believers, not unbelievers </p>
<p>who make no such claim. And compatible with Jesus, Paul permits Christ-</p>
<p>followers to dine with unbelievers, as long as such eating does not include </p>
<p>idolatry (1 Cor 10:19–21, 27–33).</p>
<p>If fellowship with insiders who commit vice is at stake in 1 Cor 5, </p>
<p>how should a congregation today respond to such a parishioner? In an at-</p>
<p>tempt to follow the procedures of Matt 18:15–20 many churches include </p>
<p>39. Cf. Ciampa/Rosner 2010:218.</p>
