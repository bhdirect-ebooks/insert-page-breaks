<p>e third group, those who are without the Law, are doubtless </p>
<p>the majority of other Gentiles. ey do not follow Mosaic Law and are </p>
<p>typically considered idolaters. With this group Paul does not follow Torah </p>
<p>observances as he might when with the other two groups. To qualify that </p>
<p>he does not mean he engages in immoral activities typical of Gentiles, he </p>
<p>must say that he is not without the Law of God, which he explicates as </p>
<p>the law of Christ. is refers to a set of commands inclusive of living by </p>
<p>faith, walking in God’s Spirit, loving God and one’s neighbor, and simi-</p>
<p>lar precepts whether taught by or resembling the ways of Jesus (cf. 7:19; </p>
<p>8:1–6; Gal 5:13–16; 6:2; Rom 3:27; 8:2). at Paul could follow the “law of </p>
<p>Christ” and still be “without the Law” makes proper sense if the former </p>
<p>is distinguishable from Mosaic Law. e law of Christ would seem to be </p>
<p>Paul’s own default behavioral code to follow independent of any group he </p>
<p>attempts to evangelize.</p>
<p>e fourth group Paul accommodates is the weak. is is probably not </p>
<p>referring to believers who are weak in conscience; their salvation must be </p>
<p>kept rather than gained (8:7–13). He means non-believers who must be per-</p>
<p>suaded to believe the gospel and then be saved. Perhaps social rather than </p>
<p>psychological weakness is emphasized here, and if so, this identies people </p>
<p>of lower status such as slaves, the poor, and marginalized (cf. 1:26–29). Paul </p>
<p>could readily identify with them as a foreigner on the mission eld. He him-</p>
<p>self experiences frailty through suerings and hard labor as a tentmaker </p>
<p>(4:9–13). He omits “as” (ὡς) only with this group. Is this an ellipsis in which </p>
<p>ὡς is already assumed, or did he rhetorically wish to identify most with </p>
<p>this group? e second option is more likely not only because Paul wished </p>
<p>to honor the socially weak above others (cf. 12:22–24), but also because </p>
<p>the money he makes by hard labor is precisely why his proclamations can </p>
<p>remain free of charge. Similar to Greek political leaders such as Agathocles </p>
<p>and Cleon, who turned from the upper class to win favor with the lower </p>
<p>class,</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>our apostle gladly identies and mingles with those whom society</p>
<p>deems lowly.</p>
<p>Paul says he accommodates all people so that I might by all means </p>
<p>save some. He is motivated for the gospel’s sake so that he may be a part-</p>
<p>ner of it (9:23). Does partnership here connote participation in the work of </p>
<p>the gospel or the salvic benets of the gospel? To be sure, if Paul were to </p>
<p>turn away from his calling, this would seem to disqualify his partnership </p>
<p>in salvic blessings (cf. 9:16, 27). But this interpretation would seem to be </p>
<p>anticlimactic—with it, we might surmise that Paul is not so seless aer all, </p>
