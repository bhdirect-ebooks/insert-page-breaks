<p>Excursus: Interpreting “What is Written” in 4:6</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>With forceful riposte, then, the gures of Paul and Apollos’s service and </p>
<p>servanthood challenges Corinthian arrogance.</p>
<p>164</p>
<p>Divisive members should</p>
<p>not deem themselves better than others by virtue of their leaders, status, or </p>
<p>spiritual gis.</p>
<p>e former purpose for Paul taking on gurative positions is that the </p>
<p>Corinthians might learn the (saying) “not beyond what is written.” is </p>
<p>may reect a saying familiar to the Corinthians or one or more of Paul’s </p>
<p>earlier Scripture citations. I suggest a merging of the two ideas in the form </p>
<p>of double entendre as a viable alternative (see Excursus).</p>
<p>Excursus: intErPrEting “What is WrittEn” in 4:6</p>
<p>The Corinthians are to learn “the ‘not beyond what is written’” (τὸ μὴ ὑπὲρ </p>
<p>ἃ γέγραπται). The position of the neuter article τό (“the”) suggests Paul is </p>
<p>introducing a quote, and the quote’s content is perhaps a popular one the </p>
<p>Corinthians would recognize.</p>
<p>165</p>
<p>Among many interpretations of this phrase,</p>
<p>the most prominent are these: 1) some words fell out of the original text that </p>
<p>our extant copies did not preserve, or conversely, a gloss was written into </p>
<p>the extant copies; 2) Paul refers to what he has just written in this letter; 3) </p>
<p>Paul refers generally to Scripture, the Old Testament canon; 4) Paul refers </p>
<p>to a non-scriptural maxim; and 5) Paul refers to one or more of his previous </p>
<p>scriptural citations in 1:19, 31; 2:6, 16; 3:19, 20.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p>Option 1 is a formidable possibility, but there is no evidence in early </p>
<p>manuscripts that directly supports it (and if we stopped here, it would </p>
<p>take away the fun of speculating about other possibilities!). Option 2 is </p>
<p>unlikely because we would expect the grammatical inﬂections Paul normally </p>
<p>uses when referring to his own writing, such as the present tense “I write” </p>
<p>(γράφω: 4:14) or the aorist “I wrote” (ἔγραψα: 5:9) rather than the perfect </p>
<p>passive, “is written” (γέγραπται).</p>
<p>167</p>
<p>Option 3 is also unlikely given the more</p>
<p>speciﬁc and contextually based option 5. Moreover, if Paul meant to say the </p>
<p>canon of Israel&apos;s Scripture, it is odd that he himself cites sources for moral </p>
<p>164. Rightly, Finney 2012:107.</p>
