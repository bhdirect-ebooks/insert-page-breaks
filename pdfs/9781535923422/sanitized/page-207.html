<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>183</p>
<p>For Paul the foreigners pregure the Corinthians who speak in </p>
<p>tongues, whereas “this people” for Paul has now become the outsiders and </p>
<p>unbelievers. is may have sounded rather strange to the most informed </p>
<p>congregation members. ey might know that Isa 28 identies “this people” </p>
<p>as Israelites, but in Paul’s reconguration of the passage, “this people” now </p>
<p>pregures uninformed and unbelieving outsiders who currently visit the </p>
<p>church in Corinth.</p>
<p>222</p>
<p>Most congregation members, however, probably were</p>
<p>not familiar enough with the passage to know this.</p>
<p>223</p>
<p>is launching pad</p>
<p>from Isaiah, then, is at least understandable as Paul asserts that tongues are </p>
<p>(meant) for a sign not for the believers but for the unbelievers. Tongues </p>
<p>are a visible token of judgment, a sign symbolizing the “inaccessibility of </p>
divine revelation.”
<p>224</p>
<p>is sign is negative. If all in the church, hypothetically</p>
<p>speaking, spoke in tongues and there came in those who are uninformed </p>
<p>or unbelievers, Paul asks, will they not think you are mad? e unspoken </p>
<p>answer is “yes,” this is how outsiders would perceive them. ey might con-</p>
<p>clude that Christ’s followers are just another mindless cult whose worship </p>
<p>resembles the ecstatic frenzies among followers of Dionysus or Cybele.</p>
<p>225</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Such visitors might reject Christ and the church. Unintelligible tongues, </p>
<p>then, serve as a negative sign for unbelievers—they remain in their unbelief </p>
<p>aer hearing the cacophony. Conversely, tongues are not a negative sign for </p>
<p>believers since they understand that tongues are self-edifying and a spiritual </p>
<p>gi from God even though they may not understand what is being said.</p>
<p>226</p>
<p>e next sentence, but prophecy is not for the unbelievers but for </p>
<p>the believers, is extremely dicult to explain given that, subsequently in </p>
<p>14:24–25, unbelievers conrm rather than deny God’s presence in the con-</p>
<p>gregation when hearing prophecy. As is occasionally suggested, one won-</p>
<p>ders if Paul’s secretary or an early copyist accidentally made the blunder. </p>
<p>Or is it that Paul reiterates a Corinthian saying in 14:22b (similar to 6:12), </p>
<p>which he then proceeds to correct in 14:24–25? Problematic with this is </p>
<p>that “so then” (οὖν) in 14:23 does not intend to contradict what precedes it.</p>
<p>227</p>
<p> </p>
<p>222. For Paul, however, this does not nullify Israel as God’s people; he elaborates </p>
<p>elsewhere that even though Gentiles in Christ are now included among God’s elect </p>
<p>people, Israel is still that people (e.g., Rom 9–11).</p>

<p>225. See Smit 1994:183; Hays 1997:238–39. Chester 2003:116–17; 2005:417–46, </p>
<p>interprets the madness as a positive sign in which Greco-Roman outsiders will think </p>
the church is divinely inspired. is interpretation, however, seems to defeat Paul’s aim
<p>to discourage congregants from publicly speaking with uninterpreted tongues.</p>
