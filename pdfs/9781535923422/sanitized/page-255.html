<p>Closing Matters (1 Cor 16:1–24)</p>
<p>231</p>
<p>time or later, it also conveyed peace and reconciliation and may be associ-</p>
<p>ated with the “kiss of peace” mentioned by church fathers.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul’s greeting with his own hand helps validate the letter (16:21; cf. </p>
<p>Gal 6:11; Phlm 19; Col 4:18).</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>Prior to this moment, a secretary wrote what</p>
Paul dictated. Ability to write placed the individual among a minority of
<p>ancient people with education and high social standing. And the ability to </p>
<p>have someone else write when one could write for oneself exemplied even </p>
<p>higher status. Paul’s penmanship signals him as someone worthy of the </p>
<p>audience’s respect and attention: “Look, I can write, but I can avoid doing </p>
<p>so. Most of you can do neither, so listen to me.”</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>If his own handwriting</p>
<p>elicits ethos, his follow-up warning elicits pathos: If anyone does not love </p>
<p>the Lord, let that person be accursed. Maranatha! Loving the Lord re-</p>
<p>calls again the recongured Shema from 8:3–6 and implies covenantal love </p>
<p>between God and God’s people inclusive of loyalty and obedience (Deut </p>
<p>6:4–6).</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>Given this backdrop from Deuteronomy, Paul’s anathema may also</p>
<p>originate from this scripture, which enunciates utter destruction upon the </p>
<p>object of God’s curse (Deut 13:16, 18; 20:17).</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>If so, when coupled with the</p>
<p>idea of Christ’s second coming described by maranatha, what is imagined </p>
<p>by this curse is the Lord at the end times punishing those who are disloyal </p>
<p>to the new covenant.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>Such warning Paul hopes would elicit fear enough to</p>
<p>deter the Corinthians from any more factions. Curses may be an eective </p>
<p>tool for persuading the Corinthians against misbehavior, who as a people in </p>
<p>general seem to believe that oaths to deities could not be taken back (Pausa-</p>
<p>nius Descr. 2.2.1).</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>Roman Corinthians appear to be quite fearful of curses</p>
<p>as is evident by discoveries of curse epitaphs and numerous metal curse </p>
<p>tablets (dexiones) found in their city.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p> </p>
<p>John Fotopoulos argues that Paul’s conditional curse, when linked </p>
<p>with the Aramaic maranatha, is evidence of mystically empowered foreign </p>
<p>words (voces mysticae), which were oen used in curses and understood </p>
<p>41. See Weima 1994:113.</p>
<p>42. Arzt-Grabner et al. 2006:521.</p>

<p>44. is love is more than mere emotions (Bachmann 1936:478) or friendship (Mof-</p>
<p>fatt 1938:281–82) or both (Sampley 2002:1002); albeit, such ideas are not opposed to </p>
<p>covenant love since Paul doubtless encourages personal friendship with the Lord (cf. </p>
<p>Tilling 2012:191).</p>
<p>45. ese verses t better our current text than the curses in Deut 27–30, since </p>
<p>κατάρα, not ἀνάθεμα, is used in the latter (Tilling 2012:192).</p>
<p>46. Similarly, Eriksson 2001:124; Konradt 2003:455.</p>
