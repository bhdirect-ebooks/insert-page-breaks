<p>in them and they in Christ (Gal 2:20; 3:27; Col 3:17).</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>In this collective</p>
<p>body every member counts regardless of ethnic (whether Jew or Greek) </p>
<p>and status dierentiations (whether slave or free).</p>
<p>134</p>
<p> Baptism here doubt-</p>
<p>lessly refers to conversion-initiation since those who participate in it become </p>
<p>members that belong to the body of Christ. Although in the parallel passage </p>
<p>of Gal 3:27–28, in which water baptism is in view, Paul nds no problem </p>
<p>using the term baptize for both the water ritual and conversion-initiation in </p>
<p>the Spirit (see 10:2). He focuses on the latter here—in one Spirit we all were </p>
<p>baptized into one body of Christ.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p>Spirit baptism for Paul may be viewed</p>
<p>both as a conversion event (12:13) and indwelling (Rom 8:9). is picture </p>
<p>is not much dierent than the baptism in the Spirit mentioned in Acts </p>
<p>10:44—11:18 in which the rst uncircumcised Gentile converts, Cornelius </p>
<p>and his household, are baptized in Spirit and speak in tongues (prior to </p>
<p>water baptism), though for Paul tongues is only one of many spiritual gis, </p>
<p>and not everyone has this gi (12:28–30).</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>Rather than water, the Spirit</p>
<p>is the element in which believers are baptized. ey have been drenched </p>
<p>with the Spirit, similar to plants that are watered (3:8) or as a cloud burst </p>
<p>that soaked them with a downpour of the Spirit (Isa 29:10; Ezek 32:56).</p>
<p>137</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is imagery is compatible with and perhaps originates from Joel 2:28–32 </p>
<p>(3:1–5LXX).</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>e text of Joel is a bedrock for emergent Christians who</p>
<p>identify themselves as the “church” (see 1:2). It anticipates an era in which </p>
<p>God would pour out the Spirit on the faithful, and they will call on the name </p>
<p>of the Lord; the latter idea perhaps prompts Paul’s expression “Jesus is Lord” </p>
<p>in 12:3. is outpouring would result in God’s people experiencing visions, </p>
<p>dreams, and prophecy. For Paul, when the saints assemble together, spiritual </p>
<p>manifestations concomitant with Joel’s message take place.</p>
<p>Our apostle embarks on discussing various body parts in relation to the </p>
<p>corporate body of Christ. e Corinthians would not seem to be unfamil-</p>
<p>iar with such imagery since local legends include stories about Medea, the </p>
<p>133. See Meyer 1877.2.84. e “in Christ” model (Schrage 1999:3.214–15) is more </p>
<p>explicit in Rom 12:4–6. For various interpretations, see Schnabel 2006:723–25.</p>
<p>134. Unlike the parallel Gal 3:28, male/female is missing in 12:13, perhaps delibera-</p>
<p>tively since inclusion might have served as a catalyst for the Corinthians’ lack of gender </p>
<p>distinction (11:2–16).</p>
<p>135. Alternatively, Rabens 2013:107, suggests with Spirit-initiation the use of syn-</p>
<p>ecdoche in which “a part is being used as reference to the whole” of conversion that </p>
<p>includes other elements such as water baptism (cf. 6:11).</p>
