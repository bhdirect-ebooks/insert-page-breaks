<p> Anaximenes’s rhetorical handbook recognizes inter-</p>
<p>ruptions as a peril orators face. Among his solutions is that orators are to </p>
<p>meet interruptions by showing them as contrary to justice, law, and what </p>
<p>is honorable (καλός) and publicly advantageous (Rhet. Alex. 1433a.25–29; </p>
<p>cf. 14–18). Paul would seem to agree with such sentiments by claiming that </p>
<p>in Christian assemblies, the wife’s distractive talking is shameful and runs </p>
<p>counter to Scripture. As such, these women disrespect the speaker and the </p>
<p>Spirit who inspires him or her.</p>
<p>Fusing thE horizons: WoMEn sPEakErs at church</p>
<p>Sometimes 14:34–35 is read in tandem with 1 Tim 2:9–15 to make the </p>
<p>claim that if Paul charges women to be silent, this means that churches to-</p>
<p>day should not permit women speakers, teachers, or leaders. What prompts </p>
<p>this discussion in both letters, however, arises from distinctive circum-</p>
<p>stances, and though there are some word similarities in both texts, they </p>
<p>are applied quite differently.</p>
<p>273</p>
<p>A unique situation arises in 1 Timothy in</p>
<p>which false teachings are being perpetrated in part by widows in the house </p>
<p>churches (5:5–16; cf. 1:3–7).</p>
<p>274</p>
<p>In this situation Timothy, who is pastor of</p>
<p>the church established in Ephesus, is told, “I am not permitting a woman to </p>
<p>teach and to assume authority over a man” (2:12).</p>
<p>275</p>
<p>These women are not</p>
<p>to take on teaching roles and take over male leadership, Timothy’s especial-</p>
<p>ly.</p>
<p>276</p>
<p>The decision, it seems, was not meant to be perpetual but had the</p>
<p>aim of safeguarding this congregation from the damaging teaching. It was </p>
<p>doubtless compounded by the problem that (due to no fault of their own) </p>
<p>many women in the patriarchal world were not afforded the level of literacy </p>
<p>and education given to men. With this unfortunate setback, these women </p>
<p>had become quite susceptible to false instruction. We notice that men who </p>
<p>perpetrate false teachings in the Pauline churches are also to be silenced </p>
<p>(Tit 1:11). </p>
<p>Genesis 2–3 is used in 1 Tim 2:13–14 to afﬁrm Adam as “ﬁrst,” and </p>
<p>Eve as the one “deceived” by the Serpent. To be sure, Adam is created </p>
