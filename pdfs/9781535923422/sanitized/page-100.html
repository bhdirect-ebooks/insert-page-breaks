<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>

<p>rinthian lawyers as “perverting justice” (Or. 8.9).</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>Hence, Paul’s designation</p>
<p>of court personnel as the unrighteous may not merely be synonymous for </p>
<p>“unbeliever” but implies the general injustice and corruption of judges, law-</p>
<p>yers, and court systems of the time. is view invites a contrast with Jewish </p>
<p>discourses in which judges are to show no partiality, especially when judg-</p>
<p>ing those who are poor and disenfranchised (Lev 19:15–18; Deut 1:16–17; </p>
<p>16:18–20; 27:19; Prov 24:23).</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>Such conduct might be expected all the</p>
<p>more among family members,</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>and Paul emphasizes Christ’s community</p>
<p>as believing brothers and sisters (6:1, 6–8). </p>
<p>Along with familial solidarity Paul reminds them that they are an as-</p>
<p>sembly of saints, holy ones set apart by God for righteous conduct (cf. 1:2). </p>
<p>In this regard, they are destined to judge the world and angels (6:2-3). e </p>
<p>former idea populates Jewish apocalyptic and wisdom texts (1 En. 95.3; Sir </p>
<p>4:15; 1QpHab 5.4; Jub. 32.19; Wis 4:16). In Wis 3:1–8 deceased souls of </p>
<p>the righteous will judge nations during the time of God’s visitation. Paul’s </p>
<p>assumptions may be that the saints take on a similar role as the righteous </p>
<p>at the second coming. But if so, he does not reconcile how God in Christ </p>
<p>will be the judge if the saints are also judges (Rom 2:16; 2 Cor 5:10). One </p>
<p>possibility is that the righteousness of the saints, inclusive of Jews and Gen-</p>
<p>tiles, might be revealed as some sort of standard by which the unrighteous </p>
<p>are judged, similar to how the Queen of Sheba will “condemn” the wicked </p>
<p>generation whom Jesus rebukes (Matt 12:42).</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>Perhaps more likely, Paul</p>
<p>believes the saints are directly involved as the jury, witnesses, or in a shared </p>
<p>authoritative role with Christ at the eschaton (Dan 7:12–14, 22; cf. Matt </p>
<p>19:28; Luke 22:29–30; T.Ben. 10.10). Paul also believes that fallen angels are </p>
<p>likewise judged (cf. 2 Pet 2:4; Jude 6; 1 En. 15; 41.8–9; T.Abr. 13.6).</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>saints’ participation in this task may be relative to Christ’s own dominion </p>
<p>and judgment over all things (15:24–28; cf. Dan 7:22, 27; Rev 2:26–27; </p>
<p>20:4).</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> Paul’s main point is that if the Corinthian saints inherit God’s king-</p>
<p>dom and will judge all creation, they are surely t to judge between their </p>
<p>own members’ petty litigations.</p>
<p>Apart from Paul emphasizing their saintly identity as a means to </p>
<p>discourage litigation, a couple of other solutions to their problem are as </p>
