<p>But Paul could hardly mean that only one believer will</p>
<p>win the game of salvation!</p>
<p>87</p>
<p> e notion of one might invite the Corinthi-</p>
<p>ans as a unied congregation to win;</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>however, the contrast between all</p>
<p>and one in this verse has a rhetorical aim that is particularly relevant to the </p>
<p>strong members. In order to shake up their overcondence regarding idol </p>
<p>foods Paul’s words suggest a number of them might fail in this race, similar </p>
<p>to all Israel entering the starting line of the wilderness but the majority dy-</p>
ing by divine judgment before getting to the nishing line of the promised
<p>land (10:1–5). Paul’s point is that nal salvation is not a foregone conclusion </p>
<p>for them; it requires the participants in the present to endure and exercise </p>
<p>self-control in all respects. Ancient competitive training was very rigor-</p>
<p>ous. About a month before the games competitors swear by oath that they </p>
<p>had been preparing for ten months, and judges then test the tness of the </p>
<p>athletes.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>A competitor’s self-renunciation includes the same things Paul</p>
<p>has been discussing with the Corinthians—diet and sexual abstinence.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> </p>
Since ancient boxing matches did not have weight divisions, a large
<p>boxer had an advantage over smaller opponents, but skill, speed, strength, </p>
<p>stamina, strategy, and courage were all necessary for either opponent </p>
<p>to nally win. And knockouts, injuries, and disgured faces were all too </p>
<p>common in a day when matches were without any rounds or breaks.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>boxer’s training is described by Seneca as torture—as athletes punish their </p>
<p>bodies to win a garland, so one should do the same to gain virtue, peace, and </p>
<p>steadfastness of soul (Lucil. 78.16; cf. 80.3; Tranq. 3.1). Epictetus compares </p>
<p>becoming a philosopher with becoming a winner in the Olympics. e lat-</p>
<p>ter requires special dieting, hours of exercise, and endurance during the </p>
<p>contest (Diatr. 3.15.2–12). Even though Paul and stoic philosophers both </p>
<p>describe virtuous practice with agonistic metaphors, Paul has a dierent </p>
<p>goal in mind. Athletes discipline their bodies for a perishable wreath, but </p>
<p>believers do so for a better prize, an imperishable wreath.</p>
