<p>that they were taken out of Egypt to be killed in the wilderness. Again the </p>
<p>rebellion centers on food, which anticipates Paul’s accusation of the strong </p>
<p>members provoking the Lord to jealousy by their presumptuous freedom to </p>
<p>eat idol meats (10:22–23). Testing the Lord, if unchecked, leads to provok-</p>
<p>ing him.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>e next warning, do not grumble, becomes the occasion for</p>
<p>the wilderness generation being destroyed by the destroyer. is is pre-</p>
<p>sumably an angelic being (Exod 12:12–23; Ps 78[77]:49; 1 Chr 21:12–15). </p>
<p>Perhaps Paul, inuenced by Wis 18:20–25 or a similar early interpretation </p>
<p>of Korah’s rebellion, associated the destroying angel with Korah’s death, a </p>
<p>prime exemplar of grumbling and rebellion (Num 16:1–50; cf. vv. 11, 41).</p>
<p>120</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul may be anticipating congregants grumbling over his present warnings </p>
<p>against idol foods, or he may recall their earlier criticisms against him in </p>
<p>relation to their factions (4:3–5). Judgment by destruction is signicant for </p>
<p>Paul because he believes that wrongdoers will be destroyed at the end of the </p>
<p>age (1:18; 2 Cor 2:15; Rom 14:15; 2 ess 2:10). In the Corinthian situation, </p>
<p>the weak might be destroyed via idolatry due to the strong members’ liber-</p>
<p>ties (8:11), and here in our current passage the strong learn that they, too, </p>
<p>are susceptible to destruction.</p>
<p>ese hypothetical prerepresentations, Paul claims, are for our ad-</p>
<p>monition upon whom the ends of the ages have come. e plural “ends” </p>
<p>or “events” (“τὰ τέλη”) of the ages seem to come in opposite directions to </p>
<p>meet (see 7:29).</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>e events of the past and future have now intersected or</p>
<p>overlapped in the present time.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>Paul works with apocalyptic imagery that</p>
<p>evokes the presence of the new era and eventual judgment it brings when </p>
<p>Christ returns. is leads to his nal warning in this passage that essentially </p>
<p>sums up (so then) the point of the Scripture references in 10:1–11 and draws </p>
<p>attention especially to the strong members—the one who thinks he stands </p>
<p>in salvation should take heed, lest he fall. is fall (πίπτω) does not merely </p>
<p>refer to falling into sin; from Paul’s perspective a number of Corinthians </p>
<p>are already sinning (cf. 1 Cor 6:12–20; 15:34). It refers to apostasy, a falling </p>
<p>away from the grace and salvation adumbrated in 10:1–4 and thus incur-</p>
ring divine judgment akin with the wilderness generation in 10:5–10. at
<p>generation died in the desert never to experience the place of rest promised </p>
to them, and the Corinthian who falls away experiences divine rejection and

<p>121. See Fitzmyer 2008:388; Héring 1949:80–81. Dierently, Court 1982:62–63 </p>
<p>criticizes the notion of “back end”/“front end.” On τέλος as “event,” see LSJ 1773.</p>
<p>122. Alternatively, the plural τέλη may reect apocalyptic traditions that depict </p>
<p>several eras (Dan 2, 7, 8; 1 En. 93; T.Lev. 10.2; T.Abr. 19.7), and perhaps Paul collides </p>
<p>the past eras with some future eras (cf. 15:20, 23–24).</p>
