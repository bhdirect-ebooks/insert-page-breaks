<p>135</p>
<p>since it can lead them to idolatry and cause weaker members to fall away. </p>
<p>He adds that all things do not build up. What must be built up is the Spirit’s </p>
<p>temple, the body of believers in Christ, and the way to do this is by mem-</p>
<p>bers edifying one another in love (8:1).</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>By insisting on their freedom to</p>
<p>eat idol meats, the strong tear down rather than build up weaker members. </p>
<p>ey ought to follow Paul’s maxim instead: Let no one seek his own advan-</p>
<p>tage, but the advantage of others (10:24). is saying resembles Seneca’s </p>
<p>friendship language: “e one wants a friend for his own advantage; the </p>
<p>other wants to make himself an advantage to his friend” (Lucil. 48.4). Paul, </p>
<p>however, encourages what is advantageous not just for friends but also for </p>
<p>the “other,” suggesting for the Corinthians someone unlike themselves.</p>
<p>148</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the strong this includes not only seeking what is benecial for weak </p>
<p>believers but also unbelievers (10:27, 32). With his principle intact Paul now </p>
<p>presents two scenarios related to idol foods—buying it in the market place </p>
<p>(10:25–26) and eating it when invited to an unbeliever’s home (10:27–29a).</p>
<p>e rst circumstance imagines congregation members in the macel-</p>
<p>lum, the city’s meat market. John Fotopoulos locates the Corinthian market </p>
<p>at “the Peribolos containing the statue of Apollo,” a sacred site close to many </p>
<p>temples including the imperial cult.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>Its proximity to these places suggests</p>
<p>that much of the meat for sale had been oered to idols, which perhaps </p>
<p>prompted certain congregants to inquire about the meat they wanted to </p>
<p>purchase.</p>
<p>150</p>
<p>For Paul, believers are free to purchase and eat market meat</p>
<p>so long as they are asking no questions to the butcher regarding whether </p>
<p>it has been oered to idols. To assure condence in what they eat, Paul af-</p>
<p>rms from scripture that the earth is the Lord’s and the fullness of it (Ps </p>
<p>24:1). e psalm proclaims the Lord as mighty creator of the earth. One </p>
<p>may adduce from the text that meat is good because the Lord created all the </p>
<p>animals from which it comes. For the unknowing believer it remains whole-</p>
<p>some and free of demons even if it was used in an idolatrous ritual. e </p>
<p>notion of refusing such meat if informed about its idolatrous connections is </p>
<p>for the sake of conscience. In 10:25 this may assume that some weak believ-</p>
<p>ers, whose conscience is easily damaged (see 8:7, 10), can purchase meat if </p>
<p>they do not ask questions about it. en again, the strong can also appreci-</p>
<p>ate these words since in 10:29 the conscience turns out to be not their own </p>
<p>but another’s (at least in the situation described in 10:27–28).</p>

<p>148. Barrett 1968:240. Here “other” is ἕτερος not ἄλλος.</p>
<p>149. Fotopoulos 2003:240.</p>
<p>150. Similarly, dietary laws prompted Jews to inquire about meat (m. Hul. 1:1; m. </p>
<p>‘Abod. Zar. 2:3; Fitzmyer 2008:399–400). </p>
