<p>followed them, and the rock was Christ. Christ’s preexistence is assumed; </p>
<p>he was present with the wilderness generation, nurturing and feeding them. </p>
<p>Paul associates Christ with the Lord in Jewish Scripture (8:6; 10:9), whose </p>
<p>presence stood at the rock of Horeb, from which water owed at the begin-</p>
<p>ning of Israel’s travels (Exod 17:5–6) and the rock of Kadesh from which </p>
<p>water owed toward the end of their travels (Num 20:7–11). Ancient Jewish </p>
<p>interpreters like Paul drew the inference that the rock in both passages was </p>
<p>the same rock, and it must have followed them throughout their journeys </p>
<p>giving them water during their forty years of travelling.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the wilderness generation all experienced these gracious blessings </p>
<p>from God, this did not prevent the majority of them from being massacred, </p>
<p>strewn out in the wilderness.</p>
<p>110</p>
is reects divine judgment at Kadesh
<p>against the wilderness generation which murmured against God and Moses </p>
<p>and wanted to return to Egypt (Num 14:16). God punishes them by having </p>
<p>them wander for forty years in the wilderness; the older generation would </p>
<p>die in the desert as a result (14:29–33). If God’s pleasure suggests favor and </p>
<p>calling (Gal 1:15; cf. Exod 4:22; Deut 1:11), the notion that God was not </p>
<p>pleased with that generation may constitute a reversal of such things (Heb </p>
<p>10:38; Hab 2:4 LXX).</p>
<p>111</p>
Paul’s vivid portrayal of divine rejection helps drive
<p>home an important comparison in 10:6 and 11. e forefathers’ initial de-</p>
<p>liverance, miraculous preservation, and subsequent rejection in the wilder-</p>
<p>ness happened as types of us.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>ese types refer to more than the events of</p>
<p>the wilderness generation being mere examples for the Corinthians to learn </p>
<p>from. Christ’s followers are connected with and sharers of God’s elect people </p>
<p>in the Scriptures. As such, the events seem to be advance presentations in </p>
<p>which “the way God worked with Israel pregures the way God works </p>
<p>through the Corinthian congregation.”</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>e wilderness events, then, may</p>
<p>be understood both as actual (10:1–4) and hypothetical prerepresentations </p>
<p>(10:5–10); the latter are given to warn the Corinthians against fullling </p>
what their forefathers did and similarly incur divine punishment.
<p>114</p>
<p>e wilderness episodes are presented so that we might not crave </p>
<p>evil things as they also craved. ese words recall the people craving foods </p>
