<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>
<p>198</p>
<p>brings together select resurrection traditions in a unique way.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>According</p>
<p>to Gal 1:15—2:1 he met with the apostles Peter and James in Jerusalem </p>
<p>three years aer his transformation.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>He mentions both as witnesses of the</p>
<p>resurrection (15:5, 7), and it is quite possible that he received his “creed” </p>
<p>from them. is implies that rather than Paul shaping the traditions written </p>
<p>later on in the canonical Gospels, the oral traditions behind the Gospels </p>
<p>shaped Paul’s own understanding of Christ’s death, burial, resurrection, and </p>
<p>appearances. Birger Gerhardsson rightly discerns the importance of prior </p>
<p>traditions:</p>
<p>Elementary psychological considerations tell us that the early </p>
<p>Christians could scarcely mention such intriguing events as </p>
<p>those taken up in the statements about Jesus’ death and resur-</p>
<p>rection without being able to elaborate on them. Listeners must </p>
<p>immediately have been moved to wonder and ask questions. Re-</p>
<p>garding our text there must have existed in support of the dier-</p>
<p>ent points in the enumeration [of 15:3–8] . . . narratives about </p>
<p>how they came about. Our text . . . cries out for elaboration.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>e rst confessional statement that Christ died for our sins presup-</p>
<p>poses Jesus as the anointed savior who would deliver his people according </p>
<p>to prophecy (e.g., Isa 61:1–3).</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>His death on the cross has redemptive value</p>
<p>and is reminiscent of the expiation of sins declared at the Lord’s Supper </p>
<p>(11:24; cf. 2 Cor 5:21; Rom 3:25; 4:25; 5:9). His ecacious death is accord-</p>
<p>ing to the Scriptures, and may assume a passage such as Isa 53:5 in which </p>
<p>the suering servant, whom believers identify as Jesus, is wounded and </p>
<p>weakened “on account of our sins” (52:13—53:12).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>It seems best, however,</p>
<p>not to reduce these confessions to only one scripture referent, especially </p>
<p>since “scriptures” is plural. More broadly, Paul perhaps understood Jesus to </p>
<p>be fullling the Law, prophets, and psalms (Luke 24:25–27, 44–46). If so, </p>
<p>then the suering servant discourse may presuppose an understanding of </p>
<p>atonement from sin captivated in Israel’s ancient sacricial system, which </p>
<p>Paul sees as foreshadowing Christ’s sacricial death (e.g., Lev 1–5, 16).</p>
<p>8. See Coppins 2010:286. e repetitive “then . . . then . . . .then” (15:5–7) may </p>
<p>suggest chronological order (Lietzmann/Kümmel 1949:77).</p>
<p>9. MacGregor 2006:226–27, dates this event at 35 CE, and the “creed” Paul cites </p>
<p>even earlier since it would already be formed prior to his meeting these apostles.</p>
