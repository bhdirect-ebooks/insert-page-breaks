<p>infamous wife of Jason, who was responsible for cutting into pieces the bodies </p>
<p>of her brother and Jason’s uncle (see Introduction).</p>

<p> Paul, however, personi-</p>
<p>es body parts humorously to instruct about solidarity. e foot and ear feel </p>
<p>unworthy because they are not the hand and eye, respectively, and Paul asks </p>
<p>rhetorical questions about whether the foot and ear are any less part of the </p>
<p>body because of this. e expected answer is “no.” Similarly, the body parts </p>
<p>that think too highly of themselves, the eye and head, cannot say to the hand </p>
<p>and feet, respectively, I have no need of you. e questions posed in 12:17, </p>
<p>19 imagine the monstrosities of a single body part becoming the entire body, </p>
<p>whether one gigantic eye, ear, or another part. ese questions prompt his </p>
<p>auditors to agree that each member of the body is necessary for the whole </p>
<p>to function properly. e center of Paul’s chiasm drives home the points that </p>
<p>there are many parts and yet one body, and that God has sovereignly placed </p>
<p>the members, each one of them in the body, just as He wanted. Paul teaches </p>
<p>interdependence contrary to the claim of not needing other parts; the body </p>
depends on the diversity of its members.
<p>140</p>
<p>e solidarity promoted in this body celebrates the members that </p>
<p>might seem to be less important, insignicant, and unpresentable (such </p>
<p>as genitalia). ese members, the apostle insists, are necessary, should be </p>
<p>given honor, and receive greater presentability, respectively (12:22–24). </p>
<p>God has composed the body together giving greater honor to the mem-</p>
<p>ber who feels inferior. Such disposition turns out for the greater benet </p>
<p>of the entire body. Along this line, Aesop relates a fable in which the eyes </p>
<p>blame the human they belong to for having the mouth gain pleasure from </p>
<p>many things, especially honey. e human then gives the eyes honey, which </p>
<p>makes them cry in pain as they learn that honey is unpleasant for them (Dio </p>
<p>Chrysostom Or. 33.16). Paul’s social body, moreover, calls into question as-</p>
<p>sumptions of political bodies that favor those who are considered by society </p>
<p>to be signicant: the elitists and upper classes. Honor instead goes to those </p>
<p>considered less honorable.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>is is the way God operates in the body of</p>
<p>Christ—status does not matter. e elevated recognition of the lowly will </p>
<p>help prevent schisms in the congregation, and Paul suggests a new order in </p>
<p>which members do not boast and compete against each other but recognize </p>
<p>their mutual dependency and care for one another. As one body in Christ </p>
<p>they are to rejoice together with those who are honored, and suer with </p>
<p>139. Corinth’s sanctuary for Asclepius also had grateful devotees oer various rep-</p>
<p>licas of body parts that had been healed by the god, but these votive oerings date back </p>
<p>to the h and fourth centuries BCE (Wickkiser 2010:43–44, 53), making it rather </p>
<p>questionable that they were still visible to the Corinthians of Paul’s day.</p>
