<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>171</p>
<p>Job 48–50; Apoc. Zeph. 8.3–4),</p>
<p>158</p>
<p>it is more plausible to surmise that Paul</p>
<p>thought such languages were not only attainable but that he himself could </p>
<p>speak in them.</p>
<p>159</p>
<p>Max Turner perceptively suggests that “like most modern</p>
<p>Pentecostals/charismatics without linguistic expertise, [Paul] would simply </p>
<p>assume that utterances that sounded like unknown languages (and were </p>
<p>capable of charismatic ‘interpretation’) were kinds of languages (earthly or </p>
<p>heavenly).”</p>
<p>160</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Without love, in any case, the most sublime tongues are reduced to </p>
<p>the sound of reverberating bronze or a clanging cymbal.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p>ese sounds</p>
<p>might be heard at cultic processions such as with Bacchic/Dionysian or Cy-</p>
<p>bele festivities.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p> Paul’s point, however, is not to compare tongues with cul-</p>
<p>tic instruments but with sounds from something that is lifeless.</p>
<p>163</p>
<p>Likewise,</p>
<p>these sounds are simply noise without melody (14:7–8). One application of </p>
<p>this is that without love, those who utter unknown tongues in public will </p>
<p>not bother to seek an interpreter; they only want to edify themselves and </p>
<p>not others. As such, their tongues are merely noise.</p>
<p>Prophecy itself either discloses all mysteries and all knowledge, or </p>
<p>these are three distinct spiritual gis. Since the revelation of “mysteries” </p>
<p>may refer to the word of wisdom, and “knowledge” refers to the word of </p>
<p>knowledge (12:8; 14:6, 26), three gis is the preferable view. ese gis are </p>
<p>totally decient without love, but when operating in love they seek to edify </p>
<p>others (14:3, 26).</p>
<p>164</p>
<p>e gi of faith is exemplied by Paul’s metaphoric</p>
<p>ability to remove mountains, echoing what Jesus taught (Matt 17:20; Mark </p>
<p>11:22–24). Without love, however, these gis result in him saying, I am </p>
<p>158. e former mentions Job’s three daughters given sashes and enabled to speak </p>
<p>in “angelic dialect,” the “dialect of the archons,” and the “dialect of those on high,” re-</p>
<p>spectively (OTP 1.85–66).</p>
<p>159. If for the sake of argument, he is agreeing with the Corinthians’ own belief that </p>
<p>their tongues include angelic languages but disbelieves it himself, his claim to speak </p>
<p>in tongues more than all of them (14:18), and his command for them to not prohibit </p>
<p>tongues (14:39), seem disingenuous.</p>

<p>161. Paul’s use of χαλκὸς ἠχῶν may refer to an acoustic bronze jar that amplies </p>
<p>one’s voice in theatre (Klein 1986:286–89), a gong (ISV), or a “ringing bronze-thing” </p>
<p>further explicated by Paul as a “loud-sounding cymbal” (Portier-Young 2005:101; Ci-</p>
<p>ampa/Rosner, 2010:629).</p>
