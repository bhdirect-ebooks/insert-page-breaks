<p>from Acts.</p>

<p>What we do know is that he is a fellow believer in Christ—he is</p>
<p>called a brother and is one of Paul’s coworkers.</p>
<p>Paul identies the Corinthian recipients as the church (ἐκκλησία), </p>
<p>a term normally referring to political assemblies but here addressing the </p>
<p>gathering of those who belong to God and Christ. Christ’s earliest followers </p>
<p>probably thought themselves to be the prophetic fulllment of the last days </p>
<p>community mentioned in Joel 2:16 (LXX).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> ey were experiencing the sal-</p>
<p>vation and spiritual life anticipated in this prophetic discourse. Paul stresses </p>
<p>this community’s holiness as sanctied and called to be saints. Again, it </p>
<p>seems that Joel 2:16 helped formulate early Christian self-references as </p>
<p>saints, literally “holy ones.” is verse shows that the end-time ἐκκλησία is </p>
<p>to be holy. e apostles promoted the notion that Christ-followers are an </p>
<p>end-time, holy assembly belonging to God.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>To be sanctied or made holy</p>
<p>has a cultic sense of being dedicated to the service of God and set apart </p>
<p>from secular and profane things (Lev 19:1–8).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>For Paul, ethical piety is also</p>
<p>bound up with holiness (6:9–11; 2 Cor 7:1; 1 ess 4:1–3). Relevant for the </p>
<p>Corinthians is the implication that as saints their lifestyle should be consis-</p>
<p>tent with their holy calling. ey are an end-time assembly whom God has </p>
<p>set apart to belong to God’s people.</p>
<p>As with all churches in Christ this one consists of those who receive </p>
<p>God’s Spirit and call on the name of the Lord to be saved (Joel 2:28–</p>
<p>32[3:1–5 LXX]; cf. Rom 10:9–13; Acts 2:17–22).</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>e apostles interpreted</p>
<p>Joel’s Lord to be Jesus Christ, and to call on his name imagines foremost an </p>
<p>invocation at baptism in which the convert calls on Jesus for salvation, or </p>
<p>confesses him as Lord, or both (Acts 9:14; 22:16). is identies the person </p>
<p>as belonging to and following Christ; it is what Acts seems to equate with </p>
<p>being baptized in the name of Jesus (2:38; 10:48). To rely on this name, as </p>
<p>Anthony iselton arms, is “to commit oneself in trust to the one whose </p>
<p>nature and character have been disclosed as worthy of this trust.”</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Christ’s</p>
<p>lordship, incidentally, may be compared with Caesar’s. ose who confess </p>
<p>Jesus as Lord become an alternative society in the world in contrast to the </p>
