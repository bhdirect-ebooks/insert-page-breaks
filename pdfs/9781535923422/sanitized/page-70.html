<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>e activity of building here seems to be ongoing, and since Apollos had </p>
<p>already le Corinth (16:12), it is dicult to maintain that Paul is only or </p>
<p>primarily referring to him as someone who builds improperly.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>Anyone</p>
<p>who leads, teaches, or presently inuences the congregation members is be-</p>
<p>ing exhorted, and this includes some of the letter’s recipients since a number </p>
<p>teach the congregation and exercise spiritual gis that are supposed to edify </p>
<p>members (4:15; 12:7–10, 25–30; 14:3–5, 12, 17, 26–31). </p>
<p>e materials used for the building are listed in two groups. e more </p>
<p>valuable and less combustible gold, silver, and precious stones are rst </p>
<p>mentioned, then the less valuable and more combustible wood, hay, and </p>
<p>straw. e valuable materials recall those Israel used to build its tabernacle </p>
<p>and temple (Exod 25:3–7; 35:31–33; 1 Chr 22:14–16; 29:2).</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>And the less</p>
<p>valuables were used on houses of poor quality that could rapidly burn (Dio-</p>
<p>dorus Siculus 20.65.1; cf. 5.21.5; Seneca Ep. 90.9–10).</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>e sequence of</p>
<p>materials leads up to a climax—they go through the process of re.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p> Ele-</p>
<p>ments such as gold and silver are rened though this process, whereas wood </p>
<p>and straw are destroyed. Alexander Kirk persuasively advances in 3:11–15 </p>
<p>that the building materials represent human persons and the work should </p>
<p>be understood as the “product” or “undertaken work” rather than “deed” or </p>
<p>“action.” at product is the Corinthian congregation.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>is is supported</p>
<p>by explicit armations in 3:9 that the Corinthians are God’s eld and God’s </p>
<p>building (i.e., God’s temple, 3:16).</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>As well, this congregation is viewed as</p>
<p>Paul’s “work” in the Lord (9:1), and temple imagery for earliest Christians </p>
<p>describes believers themselves rather than their deeds (Eph 2:19–22; 1 Pet </p>
<p>2:4–8).</p>
<p>123</p>
<p> We can add to this that Paul returns with another structural meta-</p>
<p>phor of building up and tearing down that refers to the Corinthians in 2 </p>
<p>Cor 10:8, 12:19, and 13:10 (cf. Jer 1:10). e word for build (ἐποικοδομέω), </p>
<p>which appears four times in 3:10–15, connotes the activity of erecting God’s </p>
<p>temple that is comprised of those who are in Christ. </p>
<p>is labor is rewarded and requires workers to preach, baptize, train, </p>
<p>encourage, or in some other way help establish the faith of new converts </p>
<p>who represent the material of this temple. e end product, then, which </p>
