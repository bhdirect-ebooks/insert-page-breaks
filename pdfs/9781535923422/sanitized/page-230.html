<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>

<p>faith. ey have perished in the sense of being “outside the gospel’s saving </p>
<p>p o w e r.”</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>As such, they share the same fate as unbelievers being eternally</p>
<p>lost and eschatologically destroyed (1:18; 2:6; 3:17; 2 Cor 2:15–16). Our </p>
<p>apostle concludes with another condition and result that seems to be based </p>
<p>primarily on the previous result (15:18) along with the main hypothetical </p>
<p>statements in 15:13 and 16: If we have hoped in Christ in this life only, </p>
<p>we are to be pitied more than all humans (15:19). e apostles suer per-</p>
<p>secution and hardships in vain as gospel proclaimers if Christ is not risen. </p>
<p>ey are to be pitied since they are still in sin, and so apart from suering </p>
<p>in this life uselessly for their false belief, they also face eschatological de-</p>
<p>struction aer death.</p>
<p>e previous hypothetical circumstances are then dismissed for the </p>
<p>reality of Christ’s resurrection, which assures the future resurrection of </p>
<p>believers along with death’s demise (15:20–28; cf. 6:14; Rom 8:23, 29; Phil </p>
<p>3:20–21). But now Christ has been risen from the dead, the rstfruits of </p>
<p>those who have fallen asleep in death.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>Christ’s resurrection marks the</p>
<p>pivotal point in Paul’s apocalyptic framework—it reverses Adam’s curse </p>
<p>that brought about sin and death in the original creation (Gen 3; cf. Rom </p>
<p>5:12–20). All humanity exists in solidarity with this rst human representa-</p>
<p>tive, and as a result, in Adam all die.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>However, those who are in Christ,</p>
<p>the second human representative, will all be made alive on account of his </p>
<p>resurrection. Our apostle imagines two contrasting realms or domains for </p>
<p>those who are in Adam and those who are in Christ.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>e latter’s realm</p>
<p>is the new creation characterized by new life (2 Cor 5:17), which stands </p>
<p>over against Adam’s fallen creation characterized by death. e resurrection </p>
manifestations have their own divinely appointed order. Christ’s took place
<p>rst during his advent and is described as the rstfruits, which recalls fes-</p>
<p>tive oerings associated with the Feast of Weeks (Lev 23:1–22). e occasion </p>
<p>marks the rstfruits of harvest oered on the third day aer the Passover </p>
<p>meal, a feast Paul interprets as foreshadowing Christ’s death and resurrec-</p>
<p>tion (see 5:7; 15:4). What is oered as rstfruits is holy and representative of </p>
<p>the quality and character of the entire harvest that must eventually follow.</p>
