<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>
<p>201</p>
<p>the risen Christ (9:1, 5). His witness is another oral testimony not found in </p>
<p>the Gospels.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Paul considers him to be one of the “pillars” of the Jerusalem</p>
<p>church (Gal 1:17–20; 2:9). en Christ appeared to all the apostles, which </p>
<p>seems to go beyond the Twelve, and perhaps suggests all other believers </p>
<p>who encountered the risen Christ aer James. With this extension Paul im-</p>
<p>plicates himself among their number.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Last of all, Paul claims that he appeared to me also (15:8). is prob-</p>
<p>ably refers to his encounter with Christ on the road to Damascus. e risen </p>
<p>Lord appears to Paul in a bright light from heaven and speaks to him (Acts </p>
<p>9:1–19; 22:6–11; 26:12–18; cf. Gal 1:12–16). Paul fell down and heard the </p>
<p>Lord’s words and was stricken with temporary blindness, and those who </p>
<p>were with him witnessed the phenomenon, though dierently than Paul.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jesus appeared to him in a gloried state similar to his transguration in </p>
<p>Luke 9:29. is event, though similar to a theophany, was more than merely </p>
<p>a vision. Paul could speak of it as an objective encounter distinct from the </p>
<p>more subjective vision he had in 2 Cor 12:1–9.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>Christ’s appearance to Paul</p>
<p>is also conrmed in Acts by Ananias (Acts 9:17), Barnabas (9:27), and Jesus </p>
<p>as described by the Lukan Paul (26:16).</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> More importantly, Paul’s own tes-</p>
<p>timony reects an objective encounter comparable with the other apostles </p>
<p>(cf. 1 Cor 9:1). Hence, Paul’s view of the resurrected Messiah does not seem </p>
<p>to be very dierent than the Gospels which more specically have Christ </p>
<p>identied, touched, handled, and eating with his disciples aer his resurrec-</p>
<p>tion (Luke 24:39–42; John 20:17, 27). Christ’s gloried risen state maintains </p>
<p>some sense of continuity with the body buried—the vacated burial site of </p>
<p>Jesus suggests that Jesus rose in his own body with the same surviving “I.” </p>
<p>And as the rstfruits of the resurrection, there is continuity between his </p>
<p>resurrected state and those who will rise again in the future (15:20–22).</p>
<p>He describes himself in relation to this encounter as though to one </p>
<p>untimely born. is language reects a metaphorical miscarriage pointing </p>
<p>to his dead spiritual state given new life in Christ aer he believed (cf. Eph </p>
<p>2:1–5).</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>Paul seems to adopt ἔκτρωμα from the story of Miriam’s leprosy</p>
<p>22. Jerome (c. 347–420) quotes from the Gospel of the Hebrews about how the Lord </p>
<p>rst appeared to James (Vir. ill. 2), but this account is late, and so its reliability is quite </p>
<p>questionable.</p>
