<p>other things implies that these gis are neither for status elevation nor the </p>
<p>exclusive possession of the spiritually elite.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>e interpretation of tongues</p>
<p>does not necessarily need to be a verbatim translation of the utterance, but a </p>
<p>spoken disclosure of what was said or expected by the utterance; it provides </p>
<p>meaning to the experience (cf. 14:5, 13, 26).</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>is gi also may bring into</p>
<p>articulation what is unintelligible, and perhaps even sub- or unconscious.</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>Paul shis from this list to compare solidarity of the human body with </p>
<p>church members as the body of Christ (12:12–27). Although congregation </p>
<p>members function metaphorically as body parts in this discourse, their con-</p>
<p>nection with Christ is real because they all share the same Spirit of God who </p>
<p>dwells with them as with the risen Christ: for just as the body is one and </p>
<p>has many members . . . so it is with Christ. Bodily solidarity was reected </p>
<p>also in Stoic thought that observed the universe as a body in which unity </p>
<p>with deities provides the background for ethical modes of unity for humans, </p>
<p>who are in obligation to one another (Marcus Med. 2.1; 7.13; Seneca Lucil. </p>
<p>95.52).</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>Such analogies were widespread in the Greco-Roman world, and</p>
<p>they frequently promote social and political unity (Xenophon Mem. 2.3.18; </p>
<p>Cicero O. 3.5.22–23; Dio Chrysostom Or. 3.104–7).</p>

<p> e fable of Men-</p>
<p>enius Agrippa is well-known in which the mouth, hands, and teeth rebel </p>
<p>against the belly. ey refuse to give it food, but for obvious reasons this </p>
<p>turns out to be detrimental both for themselves and the whole body (Livy </p>
<p>Hist. 2.32.12–33).</p>

<p>Mitchell observes that Paul’s metaphor of the body</p>
<p>applies to those of political writers, including the use of body parts, their </p>
<p>personication, gi dierentiation, and community contributions, gis for </p>
<p>the “common advantage,” and the sharing of one soul or spirit. ese com-</p>
<p>mon political topoi used for combating factionalism in social organisms </p>
<p>Paul transfers over to the social body of Christ for the purpose of unity in </p>
response to divisions in the community.
<p>131</p>
<p>A major distinction for Paul is</p>
<p>that he connects such topoi with baptism into Christ.</p>
<p>e one Spirit unies and connects all these believers as one body </p>
<p>(12:13; cf. 6:17),</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>which may suggest a mystical union in which Christ lives</p>

<p>128. See further, Lee 2006:101. Kim 2008; 2013:29, stresses an ethical dimension </p>
<p>for the corporate body of Christ, though (unlike Kim) the Spirit’s activity highlights </p>
<p>Christ’s resurrected rather than crucied body (e.g., Rom 8:11). </p>
