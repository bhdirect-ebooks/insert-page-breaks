<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>88</p>
<p>that she can be freed from slavery and become his wife instead (Hos 3:1–3).</p>
<p>113</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is imagines the slave no longer a mere slave even though purchased and </p>
<p>belonging to another; she is given a bride’s status, and so are those whom </p>
<p>Christ redeems.</p>
<p>Advice for Married, Unmarried, and Widows (7:1–9)</p>
<p>e apostle now addresses various domestic issues including married </p>
<p>couples (7:2–7, 10–11), unmarried and widows (7:8–9, 39–40), those mar-</p>
<p>ried to unbelievers (7:12–16), circumcised and uncircumcised (7:17–19), </p>
<p>slaves and free persons (7:20–24), and virgins and betrothed (7:25–38). </p>
<p>We could imagine quarrels, disagreements, and status dierentiation </p>
<p>when such members collided together in the congregation. is likely </p>
<p>contributed to the discord thematically addressed in this letter.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>If family</p>
<p>households are to mimic the house of God, then Homer’s words are t-</p>
<p>ting: “nothing is greater or better than this, when man and wife dwell in a </p>
<p>home in one accord” (Od. 6.182–84). Domestic matters prompt practical </p>
<p>wisdom, which here is informed by discourses that engage bodily purity, </p>
two-age apocalypse, and divine calling. e structure of this chapter fol-
<p>lows an A, B, A pattern:</p>
<p>A Advice for the Married and Unmarried (7:1–16)</p>
<p>B Remaining in One’s Calling (7:17–24)</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> Advice for Virgins about Marriage (7:25–38)</p>
<p>Level B formulates the basis upon which Paul’s advice rests. e concept </p>
<p>of remaining in one’s calling (7:20, 24; cf. 7:8, 11, 40) looks forward to the </p>
<p>end of the present age and full establishment of the new era (7:29–31). If </p>
<p>believers are undistracted by present-age institutes, they could use such op-</p>
<p>portunities to concentrate on what best honors the Lord. If they do not have </p>
<p>such opportunities, they must honor the Lord the best they can in their </p>
<p>respective states until either the Lord returns or their circumstances change.</p>
<p>e rst topic concerns marriage, and a small chiasm is noticeable </p>
<p>in terms of abstinence from sex (A: 7:1, 7), sex in marriage to avoid for-</p>
<p>nication (B: 7:2, 5b–6), sex in marriage as mutual obligation (C: 7:3, 5a), </p>
<p>and the ground for this sexual union—one’s body belongs to one’s spouse </p>
<p>(D: 7:4). Paul responds to questions in the Corinthian letter he received, </p>
<p>presumably from Chloe’s people (1:11), with the opening phrase, now </p>
<p>113. See Klein 1989:373–75; Ciampa/Rosner 2010:265.</p>
<p>114. Cf. Mitchell 1991:235.</p>
