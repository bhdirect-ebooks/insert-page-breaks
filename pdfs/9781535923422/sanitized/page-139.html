<p>witness (Acts 9; Gal 1:11–12). e importance of seeing the Lord reects </p>
<p>prophetic authority (Isa 6:1–10; Jer 1:4–10). </p>
<p>When Paul claims that he is not an apostle to others, the “others” </p>
<p>probably refer to members of congregations in which he is not the found-</p>
<p>er.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Most churches seem to be tightly knit with their founding apostles (2</p>
<p>Cor 10:13–16). is does not necessarily mean that these other churches </p>
<p>reject his apostleship; rather, Paul’s mention of them underscores that he, </p>
<p>not some other apostle, has been sent to the Corinthians.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>ey are his</p>
<p>metaphorical seal, a visible token that certies and validates his apostolic </p>
oce as divinely commissioned.
<p>37</p>
<p>anks to Paul the Corinthians now live</p>
<p>in the Lord,</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>and since God used him to reach them, they cannot deny his</p>
<p>apostleship any more than they could deny their own conversion to Christ </p>
<p>(see 2 Cor 3:2–3). </p>
<p>Paul then presents a defense against examiners who question his right </p>
<p>to do what he does as an apostle.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>ree times he repeats the question,</p>
<p>Do we not have a right to . . . ? expecting armative answers.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>e “we”</p>
<p>identies Paul and other apostolic missionaries. ey have the right to eat </p>
<p>and drink when doing the work of the Lord. Perhaps some auditors might </p>
<p>have interpreted these words as Paul’s own entitlement to eat idol foods as </p>
<p>a guest in an unbeliever’s home (cf. 8:8; 9:21; 10:27). He probably agrees in </p>
<p>principle with the saying of Jesus that his disciples could eat whatever is set </p>
<p>before them when evangelizing (cf. Luke 10:7–8).</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>All the same, he does</p>
<p>not stress here his right to eat whatever he wants but his right to eat at the </p>
<p>expense of others when on the mission eld. Paul and his colleagues also </p>
<p>have a right to bring on their trips a sister, a wife even as the rest of the </p>
<p>apostles. is sister is a fellow believer in Christ (i.e., a believing wife) and </p>
<p>may suggest that women were also itinerant apostles and prophets on the </p>
<p>mission eld.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>John Granger Cook explains that these women “became well</p>
<p>trained in apostolic teaching and, if they so chose, could have taught other </p>
<p>people in the workplaces, ‘women’s quarters’, or other settings in the Medi-</p>
