<p>laid in Zion as Christ (Isa 28:16; cf. Rom 9:33). He probably thinks of Christ </p>
<p>when adopting the phrase “says the Lord.”</p>
<p>219</p>
<p>In Isaiah’s discourse the Lord’s</p>
<p>spokespersons, the priest and prophet in Jerusalem, are portrayed as erring </p>
<p>in their communication of God’s message, being confused with drunkenness. </p>
<p>eir drunken speech is compared to baby talk that is incomprehensible, or </p>
<p>alternatively, they mock Isaiah’s prophecy as that of an infant’s (28:7–10).</p>
<p>220</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e outcome is the same either way—as a form of judgment, God will per-</p>
<p>mit incomprehensible speech to be heard by these people (28:11), whether </p>
<p>from their drunken infantile leaders (LXX?) or a foreign country (MT). e </p>
<p>MT is clearer, though we do not know to what extent Paul follows its con-</p>
<p>text. If his source is similar, it suggests that since these people do not want to </p>
<p>hear or obey the Lord’s messages through His prophet, the Lord will “speak” </p>
<p>to this people indirectly by permitting invasion by a foreign country to take </p>
<p>place in which this people will be forced to hear invaders communicate in a </p>
<p>foreign language to them. ey will be ensnared and taken captive by their </p>
<p>enemies (28:12–13). e importance of God’s people as “my people” in 28:5 </p>
<p>and “this people” in 28:11 should not be missed. is switch connotes God, </p>
<p>as it were, temporarily disowning the people by bringing judgment on them </p>
due to their refusal to listen and obey divine words.
<p>221</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our apostle has taken this theme of judgment and recongured it so </p>
<p>that the incomprehensible language of foreigners, which perhaps to the </p>
<p>people sounds like the gibberish of babies and drunkards, is compared </p>
<p>with the Corinthians speaking in tongues. If speaking in tongues sounds </p>
<p>like the voice of drunkards and foreigners, this may disclose that Paul was </p>
<p>not the only one comparing Isa 28 with the phenomenon (see Acts 2:13). </p>
<p>Perhaps he adopts this comparison orally from an earlier apostolic tradi-</p>
<p>tion, which might explain why Isaiah is so loosely referenced and similar </p>
<p>to the Hebrew text. We do not need to decide, however, on whether the </p>
<p>Isaianic and Corinthian comparison of tongues literally refers to a human </p>
<p>foreign language or is merely analogous to it. If we press the comparison </p>
<p>too far, we would have to conclude that speaking in tongues amounts to </p>
<p>speaking in Assyrian, since this is the language of the foreigners of Isaiah’s </p>
<p>text! Paul’s point of citing Isaiah, even if thought to be prophetic fulll-</p>
<p>ment, is merely to demonstrate tongues as a sign rather than probe the </p>
<p>exact nature of tongues. </p>
<p>219. So Nagel 2013:46–47.</p>
<p>220. For the latter, see Aernie 2012:95–96. e words, “ו ֑ ָקָ ָל ו ֣ ַק ו ֖ ָקָ ָל ו ֥ ַק ו ָ֔צ ָל ו֣ ַצ ֙ו ָצ ָל ו֤ ַצ י֣ כ” </p>
<p>(28:10) oen translated as “precept upon precept . . . line upon line” (NRSV), are actu-</p>
<p>ally nonsensical words (BDB 846, 875), not unlike the perception in Acts 2:13 or a </p>
<p>baby’s “goo goo gah gah.” NET’s “meaningless gibberish, senseless babbling,” is better.</p>
<p>221. Compare Isa 6:8–10 with 1:3; 5:13; Vriezen 1962:128.</p>
