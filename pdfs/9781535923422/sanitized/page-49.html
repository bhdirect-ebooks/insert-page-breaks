<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>

<p>is symbol of triumph was made from wood, shaped like a cross, and bore </p>
<p>the armor of the defeated foes. Whether through bearing his own cross or </p>
<p>being tied to the tropaion, he is paraded through the city streets on his way </p>
<p>to be executed. We could surmise that for Paul Christ’s death represents the </p>
<p>turning point of human history. Rome’s displays of power eventually give </p>
<p>way to the more powerful images of resurrection and the defeat of death. At </p>
<p>the end of the metaphorical procession depicting the age of now and not yet, </p>
<p>such worldly powers will be shamed and destroyed (1:19, 27–28; 2:6). And </p>
<p>those deemed foolish by the world’s standards, who identied with Christ </p>
<p>and his cruciform suerings, will be vindicated.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>e cross in 1:18 will result</p>
<p>in the triumph of resurrection in 15:57. </p>
<p>e apostle cites Isa 29:14 in anticipation of this victory—God will </p>
<p>destroy the wisdom of the wise and thwart the cleverness of the clever.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Isaiah, Israel’s leaders are confronted for depending on human wisdom </p>
and Egyptian advisors instead of consulting God, the divine counselor (Isa
<p>19:11–13; cf. 30:1–7; 31:1). Failing to seek their Lord, they become spiritu-</p>
<p>ally blind, and face impending judgment (29:1–12, 14), and a reverse order-</p>
<p>ing will occur in which the humble will be joyous and lied up, but the </p>
<p>proud will be humbled (29:18–19; cf. 27:1; 29:1–8).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Consequently, God</p>
<p>will turn the counsel they receive into foolishness (19:3, 11–14). Paul’s </p>
<p>rhetorical questions in 1:20 continue to be informed by Isaiah: Where is </p>
<p>the wise? recalls the elitist counselors of Isa 19:12. Where is the clerical </p>
<p>magistrate? echoes 33:18b.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>However, the third question, Where is the</p>
<p>took place and commemorated victory (see Mattingly 2006:912). For Romans it was </p>
<p>displayed in processions and on military iconography that inundated Rome and its </p>
<p>colonial cities. A procession relief with tropaion from the Roman Temple of Apollo </p>
<p>Sosianus (1</p>
<p>st</p>
<p>c. BCE) can be seen in Maier 2013:41–42. See also the Gemma Augustea</p>

<p>8. Malcolm 2013a:3–4, 156, 165, highlights this state in 1 Cor 1 and its outcome </p>
<p>in 1 Cor 15.</p>
<p>9. In Isaiah the LXX and MT promote that God will hide (κρύπτω/רתס) the clever-</p>
<p>ness of the clever, whereas 1 Cor 1:19 uses thwart (ἀθετέω). Perhaps Paul replaced the </p>
<p>term, being inuenced by κενόω in 1:17 (“render ineectual”). Otherwise, he might be </p>
<p>combining Isaiah with Ps 33[32]:10, or his Greek version already rendered רתס based </p>
<p>on its later sense of “to upset/tear down.” See discussion in Stanley 1992:185–86. Paul’s </p>
<p>word strengthens rhetorically the citation’s negative connotation (Barclay 2015:5).</p>
<p>10. Cf. Oropeza 2002a:104</p>
<p>11. e γραμματεύς, translated also as “scribe,” could be understood as Jewish </p>
<p>scholars of the Torah. In Isa 33:18 (cf. 29:11–12), however, it refers to the “one who </p>
<p>counted” (cf. Wilk 2005:138), which seems to be clerical or a tribute collector. For </p>
<p>Paul’s audience, γραμματεύς might mean “civic leaders, instructors in the gymnasia </p>
<p>and scholar/scribe”: Dutch 2005:278–87 (287). In Acts 19:35 it refers to a magisterial </p>
