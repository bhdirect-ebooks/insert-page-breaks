and distributing to each one individually as He wills (12:11).
<p>113</p>
<p>Second,</p>
<p>the various members each have dierent gis (to one . . . to another . . . ) </p>
<p>but are to work together for what is benecial for the entire body of Christ </p>
<p>(12:7; cf. 10:33).</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>Our apostle challenges the Corinthians to turn from a</p>
<p>status-seeking orientation to one of voluntary self-giving for the edica-</p>
<p>tion of others. ird, the gis mentioned here are not an exhaustive list </p>
<p>(cf. 12:28; Rom 12:4–8; Eph 4:11–12; 1 Pet 4:10–11). ey reect those </p>
<p>with which Corinthians are familiar, and some that Paul wishes they would </p>
<p>emulate more. Fourth, there seems to be no standard limit to the amount </p>
<p>of gis in which each believer is able to operate; otherwise, Paul would not </p>
<p>encourage members to desire the “greater gis” and prophesying (12:31; </p>
<p>14:1). Fih, these gis are not a magical manipulation of forces. God’s Spirit </p>
<p>has the ultimate authority to permit or deny the human experience of what </p>
<p>we today might identify as supernatural occurrences. ere may be cases, </p>
<p>for example, in which a person who operates in the gi of healing will not </p>
<p>be able to heal the sick. Paul’s colleagues Timothy and Trophimus were not </p>
<p>healed miraculously of their illnesses despite the charismatic gis of their </p>
<p>apostolic colleagues (1 Tim 5:23; 2 Tim 4:20). Finally, these gis are not </p>
<p>merely natural skills or talents; as gis from God’s Spirit they can enhance </p>
<p>natural abilities, or be newly added abilities, or both. </p>
<p>Nine gis are mentioned in 12:8–10. e word of wisdom and word </p>
<p>of knowledge are gis related to speaking.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>e Corinthians are drawn to</p>
<p>wisdom, especially as it relates to eloquent speaking (1 Cor 1–4); like Pliny, </p>
they might think that talented orators are divinely inspired (Ep. 1.20). Paul’s
<p>slant on wisdom as a gi emphasizes less the skill of articulation and more </p>
the enablement of a believer to understand divine revelation and mysteries
<p>known by God (2:6–16). Exactly how disclosure of mysteries is dierent </p>
<p>than prophecy is not explained, but they are distinguished (13:2; 14:6, 26). </p>
<p>Perhaps this gi’s main model is Daniel, the interpreter of dreams, visions, </p>
<p>and prophetic and apocalyptic discourse (e.g., Dan 1–2). A more practical </p>
<p>application of communicating wisdom may relate to Solomon (e.g., Prov-</p>
<p>erbs). It is sometimes assumed that the word of knowledge may involve </p>
<p>113. e “spirit [world]” for πνεῦμα in 12:4, 7–9, 11 (Tibbs 2006:279) is hard to </p>
<p>reconcile with 12:4–6 where the “Spirit” appears to be a personal entity, not realm, who </p>
<p>is in unity with the personal “Lord” and “God.”</p>
<p>114. For “another,” Paul switches between ἄλλος and ἕτερος. Such is found in other </p>
<p>lists (BDAG 399) and may simply substitute the contrastive “μέν . . . δέ” (12:8) to high-</p>
<p>light a dierent person (iselton 2000:944).</p>
<p>115. See options in Tibbs 2006:202. Isaianic discourse may inform Paul here; the </p>
<p>Messianic “root of Jesse,” with the Spirit resting on him, operates with the “spirit of </p>
<p>wisdom and understanding” and with “the spirit of knowledge” (Isa 11:1–2, 10; cf. Rom </p>
<p>15:12 = Jesus).</p>
