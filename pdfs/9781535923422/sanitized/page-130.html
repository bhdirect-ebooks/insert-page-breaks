<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>106</p>
<p>owers, or more likely certain women in the congregation found themselves </p>
<p>in this predicament and were the ones asking the relevant question. Along </p>
with a spouse’s abandonment by divorce, then, a spouse’s death is another
<p>condition given by Paul that allows for remarriage. e believing widow </p>
<p>can remarry, but only in the Lord—she could marry only a fellow believer </p>
<p>in Christ.</p>
<p>197</p>
<p>Our apostle, however, gives his opinion that the widow would</p>
<p>be happier remaining a widow than getting remarried. e reasons would </p>
<p>seem to be the same as he has already given. e present distress in their </p>
<p>world along with distraction from single-minded service to the Lord war-</p>
<p>rant that it is better to be single than married. </p>
<p>e nal sentence in this section, and I think I also have God’s </p>
<p>Spirit, is probably not a sarcastic jab at an overtly spiritual faction in the </p>
<p>congregation but Paul’s modest self-condence. He is not just giving his </p>
<p>personal advice anymore but may be guided by God’s Spirit. Namely, Paul </p>
<p>may be writing under spiritual inspiration as he states that widows are </p>
<p>better o remaining single, and if they do marry, they should marry only </p>
<p>another believer.</p>

<p>197. is would be in keeping with endogamous Jewish marriages: see Garland </p>
<p>2003:343–44. </p>
<p>198. We nd in Ephesus a very dierent situation that warranted Timothy’s encour-</p>
<p>agement of younger widows to get remarried (1 Tim 5:14; Oropeza 2012a:272–78). </p>
<p>is suggests that Paul’s advice against the widow’s remarriage in 1 Cor is relative to the </p>
<p>Corinthian situation. Nowhere among NT believers, however, do we nd encourage-</p>
<p>ment to marry unbelievers (see also 2 Cor 6:14).</p>
