<p>schools . . . the Hellenistic reader would nd the meaning unmistakable.”</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If so, Paul gives maturity in education a new meaning. Maturity in Christ </p>
<p>is not measured by rhetorical skills but teaching that unveils God’s wisdom </p>
<p>through the Spirit. is type of learning is neither competitive nor gained by </p>
<p>money but comes as a gi from God. Unlike rhetorical education that was </p>
reserved for upper classes, divine wisdom is granted to anyone willing to
<p>receive it—whether slave, free, man, woman, educated, or uneducated—as </p>
<p>long as the person has God’s Spirit.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>is wisdom comes fully to those who</p>
<p>regard the wisdom of this age to be insucient.</p>
<p>ird, Paul identies the rulers of this age among those who adhere </p>
<p>to the wisdom of this age and are passing away (2:6–8).</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>ese are elitists</p>
<p>who from the arena of politics think themselves wise in deliberating rheto-</p>
<p>ric. eir eectiveness depends on “their own or their cohorts’ power to </p>
<p>persuade,” and this reliance blinds them from perceiving the power behind </p>
<p>the “supposed weak wisdom” of God in Christ.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>If they had truly known</p>
<p>this wisdom they would not have crucied Christ. More specically, then, </p>
<p>they are represented by Pilate, the Roman prefect, who in collaboration </p>
<p>with the chief priests, scribes, and perhaps Herod Antipas, sentenced Je-</p>
<p>sus to death. An oral tradition of this sort was probably known by Paul </p>
<p>before written in the Gospels.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>Equally, Paul may be informed by Ps 2:1–2</p>
<p>in which the kings of the earth and rulers (οἱ ἄρχοντες) come against the </p>
<p>anointed one, which in early Christian tradition is interpreted as those who </p>
<p>put Jesus to death according to God’s predetermined plan (Acts 4:25–28). If </p>
<p>Satan and his minions are meant by the ἄρχοντες and “spirit of the world,” </p>
<p>they play an indirect role inadvertently inuencing Jesus’s eventual cruci-</p>
<p>xion (Luke 22:3–4; John 13:26–27; 14:30), but Paul’s argument here seems </p>
<p>to foreground human rulers. God’s wisdom confronts Roman ideology and </p>
<p>elitists by disrupting their order through the power-in-weakness of the </p>
<p>cross.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>What at rst seemed to be the execution of just another pretender to</p>
the throne and opponent of Caesar unleashed divine power both mightier
<p>and wiser than anything the Greco-Roman world had to oer.</p>

<p>76. Doubtless, these rulers are part of the same macro-society as those who are </p>
<p>perishing and adhere to the wisdom of this world (1:18–21).</p>
