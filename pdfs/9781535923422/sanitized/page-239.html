<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>
<p>215</p>
<p>transformation of his own devising, however unimaginable this may be to </p>
<p>human mortals now (v. 38); (c) the variety of modes of existence that lie </p>
<p>within the sovereign capacity of God to create; and (d) the continuity of </p>
<p>identity suggested by such terms as each . . . its own body (v. 38) .”</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>e four antithetical statements that follow attempt to clarify the dis-</p>
<p>tinction between the present and resurrected body (15:42–44). “It” in these </p>
<p>verses refers to the human body in contrasting pairs (cf. 15:37), and from </p>
<p>this we can arm continuity between the body that dies and one that rises. </p>
<p>Each has to do with a state, condition, or mode of existence rather than </p>
<p>substance.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> e rst antithesis contrasts the present human body as perish-</p>
<p>able, buried in death, and implicating the sentence of death given to Adam </p>
<p>aer he sinned. It will be raised imperishable, never to die again. Second, </p>
<p>the body is sown in dishonor but raised in glory. is dishonor probably </p>
<p>refers to the original Adamic glory that was lost aer Adam’s fall (see 15:37). </p>
<p>is state of dishonor will be over when the body radiates again at the resur-</p>
<p>rection even more than before to shine as bright as the stars of heaven (2 </p>
<p>Cor 3:18 cf. Dan 12:3; 1 En. 62.15–16; 104:2–6).</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>ird, the body is sown in</p>
<p>weakness, but it is raised in power. is weakness reects physical limita-</p>
<p>tions, deformities, disabilities, and diseases experienced in aging and frail </p>
<p>bodies, of which Paul’s body is an example (2 Cor 4:7–12; Phil 3:21). All </p>
<p>such weaknesses will be replaced by the resurrected body that exemplies </p>
<p>transformation and revitalization being animated and energized by God’s </p>
<p>Spirit (1 Cor 2:1–5; 2 Cor 12:9–10; Rom 8:11).</p>
<p>Fourth and nally, the human body is rst sown as a soulish-animat-</p>
<p>ed body, and raised a Spirit-animated body (15:44). God’s Spirit is the ac-</p>
<p>tive power who transforms the soulish-animated person (ψυχικός) into the </p>
<p>Spirit-animated person (πνευματικός). e ψυχικός body is made of dust </p>
<p>and belongs to the original creation. It is animated by the natural human life </p>
<p>force that characterizes Adam into whom God bestowed the breath of life </p>
<p>when he became a soul or living being (Gen 2:7).</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>Here “soul” (ψυχή) means</p>
<p>88. iselton 2000:1271 (boldface and italics in the original).</p>
<p>89. See Johnson 2003:304; Ware 2014a:831.</p>
<p>90. is does not mean, however, that Paul believed the resurrected body becomes </p>
<p>a star; it only shines like one. See Collins 1993:394; Rabens 2013:88–90; pace Engberg-</p>
<p>Pedersen 2010:42–43. Some Corinthians, though, might believe the dead become stars. </p>
<p>On ancient sources related to celestial immortality, see, Litwa 2012:140–46.</p>
<p>91. e Genesis context helps interpret “soul” (ψυχή/ ֶפ ֫ ֶנ ) as a property of both </p>
<p>humans and other creatures as living beings (Gen 1:20, 24; cf. Rev 16:3). What distin-</p>
<p>guishes human from beast is God’s image (εἰκών/ם ֶל ֫ ֶצ ), not the ψυχή (Gen 1:26; 5:1–3). </p>
<p>It would seem that for Paul, the rst Adam was created with a body composed of dust </p>
<p>and with a human “spirit” (cf. 1 ess 5:23; 2 Cor 7:1), but not normatively animated by </p>
the divine Spirit associated with Christ’s resurrection.
