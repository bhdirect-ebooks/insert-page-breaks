<p>NCCS | New Covenant Commentary Series</p>
<p>e New Covenant Commentary Series (NCCS) is designed for ministers and </p>
<p>students who require a commentary that interacts with the text and context of each </p>
<p>New Testament book and pays specic attention to the impact of the text upon the </p>
<p>faith and praxis of contemporary faith communities.</p>
<p>e NCCS has a number of distinguishing features. First, the contributors </p>
come from a diverse array of backgrounds in regards to their Christian
<p>denominations and countries of origin. Unlike many commentary series that tout </p>
<p>themselves as international the NCCS can truly boast of a genuinely international </p>
<p>cast of contributors with authors drawn from every continent of the world (except </p>
<p>Antarctica) including countries such as the United States, Puerto Rico, Australia, </p>
<p>the United Kingdom, Kenya, India, Singapore, and Korea. We intend the NCCS </p>
<p>to engage in the task of biblical interpretation and theological reection from </p>
<p>the perspective of the global church. Second, the volumes in this series are not </p>
<p>verse-by-verse commentaries, but they focus on larger units of text in order to </p>
<p>explicate and interpret the story in the text as opposed to some oen atomistic </p>
<p>approaches. ird, a further aim of these volumes is to provide an occasion for </p>
<p>authors to reect on how the New Testament impacts the life, faith, ministry, and </p>
<p>witness of the New Covenant Community today. is occurs periodically under </p>
<p>the heading of “Fusing the Horizons and Forming the Community.” Here authors </p>
<p>provide windows into community formation (how the text shapes the mission and </p>
<p>character of the believing community) and ministerial formation (how the text </p>
<p>shapes the ministry of Christian leaders).</p>
<p>It is our hope that these volumes will represent serious engagements with the </p>
<p>New Testament writings, done in the context of faith, in service of the church, and </p>
<p>for the glorication of God.</p>
