<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>157</p>
<p>with many ancient people, simply assumed that physical maladies may </p>
be caused by divine and supernatural powers (5:5; Mark 2:3–5; John 9:2;
<p>Jas 5:14–15; Rev 2:21–23). He interprets this present judgment as being </p>
<p>disciplined by the Lord (cf. Heb 12:5–11), and its purpose is so that we </p>
<p>may not be condemned with the world on judgment day and excluded </p>
<p>from God’s kingdom.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>One possible interpretation of 11:32 assumes that</p>
<p>this condemnation is conditional. Paul anticipates that the physical suer-</p>
<p>ings of those who are being disciplined would cause them to repent and </p>
<p>in this manner they will avoid future condemnation (see 5:5).</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>is either</p>
<p>implies that those who already died will be condemned (and so it appears </p>
<p>their discipline was unsuccessful),</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>or this judgment is corporate (it aects</p>
<p>certain congregation members regardless of whether they participated in </p>
<p>the wrongdoing or not).</p>
<p>91</p>
<p> A second possibility is that the Corinthians’ judg-</p>
<p>ment and discipline extends only to illness and physical death in the present </p>
<p>but not to future condemnation on judgment day. is is quite exceptional </p>
<p>when compared with the nal judgments warned against earlier (e.g., </p>
<p>3:16–17; 10:5–12)—their behavior at the supper may not be considered as </p>
<p>heinous as some of their other vices. If this view is correct, then believ-</p>
<p>ers who occasionally commit vice do not necessarily suer nal judgment </p>
<p>as do those whose lifestyle is characterized by vice (6:9–10; Gal 5:19–21).</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A third option is that we in 11:31–32 suggests corporate judgment; hence, </p>
<p>the church as an elect corporate entity is disciplined by these maladies but </p>
escapes nal judgment, whereas individual members who commit vice and
<p>eat unworthily are still in jeopardy of condemnation.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p> Paul mentions ill-</p>
<p>ness and death as a way to prompt them to correct their behavior, and thus </p>
<p>repentance is implied with any of these options.</p>
<p>Our apostle closes in 11:33–34 with some nal instructions on resolv-</p>
<p>ing their conict, similar to 11:22 but without shaming the members. ey </p>
<p>2003:553–54. Robertson/Plummer 1925:253, suggest that much sickness in the church </p>
<p>prompts Paul to point out what he thinks is its cause, though his inference is not neces-</p>
<p>sarily by special revelation.</p>
<p>88. In 11:32 κατακρίνω is a future nal judgment whereas κρίμα in 11:29, 34 is a </p>
<p>present judgment.</p>

<p>90. Marshall 1975:115–16. Ramelli 2011:145–63, argues for spiritual illness and </p>
<p>death. However, auditors in this letter are only familiarized with physical death as </p>
<p>“sleep” (7:39; 15:18).</p>
