<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>
<p>213</p>
<p>analogies from agriculture, biology, and astronomy as he uses anaphora with </p>
<p>the repetitive “another” (15:36–41), four antithetical statements (42–46), </p>
<p>comparisons and antitheses (47–51), more anaphora along with asyndeton </p>
<p>(the omission of conjunctions: 15:52), and paronomasia (similar sounding </p>
<p>words: 15:53–54; cf. vv. 42–43). e structural order in 15:35–58 parallels </p>
<p>15:12–34 (see above).</p>
<p>He rst associates the body and resurrection with planting seeds: what </p>
<p>you sow does not come alive unless it dies. And what you sow is not the </p>
<p>body that it will become, but you sow a bare kernel (15:36b–37).</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>He</p>
<p>returns here to the metaphor of rstfruits at the Feast of Weeks (15:20–23). </p>
<p>Having already associated agrarian imagery with Christ and the believers’ </p>
<p>resurrection, he now expands on it, this time focusing not on the fully grown </p>
<p>grain but on its radical transformation from a mere seed to the nished </p>
<p>product. To this imagery he seems to blend in an allusion from the creation </p>
<p>story in which plants yielding their seed are created on the third day (Gen </p>
<p>1:11–12). But now he is more interested in the new creation and thus relates </p>
<p>seeds to human bodies, more precisely dead bodies that are buried, which </p>
<p>in Christ will be raised again. Both John 12:24 and 1 Clement 24.5 likewise </p>
<p>associate seed burial with the resurrection. is analogy may be something </p>
<p>widely taught by early Christ followers. </p>
<p>Our apostle also mentions that the kernel without its husk is nude, </p>
<p>which may resonate a faint echo recalling human bodies returning naked </p>
<p>to the dust of death, thus departing from this world in the same bodily </p>
<p>state they entered it (Job 1:21; Eccl 5:15). is nudity may also presuppose </p>
<p>the Genesis creation. Adam and Eve were not ashamed of their original </p>
<p>nakedness (Gen 2:25; cf. 3:7–11). According to certain traditions, Adam’s </p>
original body was clothed with righteousness and divine glory (Vita Adam
<p>12.1; 13.2–3; 14.2).</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>is glory or radiance that reects God’s presence was</p>
<p>stripped from his body when he sinned (Apoc. Mos. 20–21; 39.2), but there </p>
<p>is anticipation for a future body of the righteous that will again be clothed </p>
<p>with it (1 En. 62.15–16).</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>Along these interpretative lines, Adam saw that</p>
he was “naked,” which perhaps meant that he was stripped of divine glory,
<p>Asher 2000:77–79). </p>
<p>80. e comparison should not be pressed, however. In farming the seed does not </p>
<p>technically “die” when covered with earth but remains hidden in the ground invisible </p>
<p>to the human eye before its spouts. Likewise, the grain that arises to “life” from the seed </p>
<p>does not live forever but eventually dies, unlike those who are raised from the dead. </p>
