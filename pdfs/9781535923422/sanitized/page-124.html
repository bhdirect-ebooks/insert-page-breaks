<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>100</p>
<p>encouraging slaves to take advantage of any opportunities they might have </p>
<p>to become free.</p>
<p>164</p>
<p>A metaphorical status reversal occurs for slaves and free persons who </p>
<p>are converted to Christ. e one who was called as a slave is the Lord’s </p>
<p>freed person, a manumitted slave for Christ; whereas the one who was </p>
<p>called as a free person is Christ’s slave.</p>
<p>165</p>
<p>is distinction is not so drastic</p>
<p>when we realize that manumitted slaves had obligations that involved hon-</p>
<p>oring their former masters as patrons.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p>In Christ, converted slaves who</p>
<p>are spiritually set free are still obligated to honor and serve Christ as their </p>
<p>metaphorical patron and spouse (see 6:20). In return, Christ bestows them </p>
<p>with great spiritual and salvic benets. Likewise, free members who have </p>
<p>become metaphoric slaves in Christ must serve Christ faithfully, and they </p>
<p>will be rewarded by him. e conversion of both slave and freeperson has </p>
<p>delivered them from enslavement to sin; the Lord purchased their bodies </p>
<p>from this bondage with the price of his death on the cross (7:22–23; cf. 6:11, </p>
<p>20; Rom 6:6, 15–23). e price of this redemption would be especially mov-</p>
<p>ing to those who knew how costly their own manumission from slavery </p>
<p>was.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p>Christ did not redeem their bodies so that they might sell them</p>
<p>again into slavery; hence, Paul commands them, do not become slaves of </p>
<p>humans.</p>
<p>168</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For Paul, slavery is an institute of the Roman Empire, which is passing </p>
<p>away in Christ. But when master or slave or both converted to Christ, is-</p>
<p>sues surrounding their status in the congregation might have become rather </p>
<p>complex for him.</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>Paul, at any rate, views slaves dierently than certain</p>
<p>ideologies that regarded them merely as tools and property.</p>
<p>170</p>
<p>He considers</p>
<p>believers among them to be equal partners in Christ and members of the </p>
<p>body of Christ (12:13; cf. Gal 3:28), and non-believing slaves he sees as po-</p>
<p>164. E.g., Harrill 1998:108–22, 126–27; Garland 2003:108–14; Merklein </p>
<p>2000:2.131–34; Horrell 1996:162–66; contrast Huttunen 2009:29; Conzelmann </p>
<p>1975:160–61. For mediating views, see Bartchy 1973:155–59; iselton 2000:544. For </p>
<p>Braxton 2000:220–33, Paul is ambiguous.</p>
<p>165. See Martin 1990:63–68.</p>
<p>166. See Garland 2003:314–15. On types of manumission, see Harrill 2003:580–81; </p>
<p>1996:54–55, 169–72.</p>
<p>167. See Nasralla 2013:72–73.</p>
<p>168. On selling oneself to slavery, see Bartchy 1973:47; Glancy 2002:82.</p>
<p>169. Barclay 1994:175–84 and Byron 2004:130–36 have good discussions along </p>
<p>these lines. </p>
<p>170. E.g., Aristotle N.E. 8.11; Pol. 1.1–7, though this reects Athens rather than </p>
<p>Rome centuries later. Seneca Ep. 47.1, 10–13, 17, is more contemporary with the NT, </p>
<p>and he considers a shared human existence for both slaves and free; slaves unfortu-</p>
<p>nately have had misfortune (Harrill 2003:576). </p>
