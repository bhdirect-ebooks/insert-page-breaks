<p>commands is then disclosed (14:36–37). Paul’s rst imperative—when you </p>
<p>assemble together . . . let all things be done for building up others—pres-</p>
<p>ents an ideal procedure of worship that can be implemented into the way </p>
<p>the congregation already does worship. Members must aim to edify others </p>
<p>with their speech gis, whether by song, teaching (see 12:28–29), revela-</p>
<p>tion (14:6), or speaking in a tongue that requires interpretation (12:10; </p>
<p>14:5). e song (ψαλμός) may refer to singing and playing a stringed instru-</p>
<p>ment or reciting/singing a psalm from the Scriptures.</p>
<p>238</p>
<p> Playing an instru-</p>
<p>ment without the aim of promoting singing or inspired speech may not have </p>
<p>been on Paul’s agenda here since he emphasizes speech gis. ere is no </p>
<p>reason, however, why musical instruments should not be played in such </p>
<p>gatherings, and given Paul’s Jewish roots, it is very likely that he thought </p>
<p>musical instruments would be conducive for praise, worship, and prophecy </p>
<p>at these gatherings (Ps 150:3–5; 2 Kgs 3:15–16). e song could be learned </p>
<p>or spontaneously inspired as in 14:15b. If a member were to sing in tongues, </p>
<p>Paul would doubtless encourage an interpretation. </p>
<p>When members speak in tongues Paul charges that two or at most </p>
<p>three should speak, not all at once but in turn, and let one interpret. e </p>
<p>person who interprets may be among the three who speak in tongues (14:5),</p>
<p>239</p>
<p> </p>
<p>or more likely another member with the gi of interpretation (12:10). It is </p>
<p>evident that not all those who speak in tongues are able to interpret their </p>
own tongues (14:13, 28), and Paul stresses diversity related to gi distribu-
<p>tion, distinguishing between members with the gi of tongues and those </p>
<p>with the gi of interpreting tongues, similar to how the gi of prophecy is </p>
<p>distinguished from discernment of prophecy (see 12:10–11, 30). If there </p>
<p>is no interpreter present, those who speak in tongues must be silent in </p>
<p>church, and they should pray in tongues quietly or privately (14:28). </p>
<p>Regarding prophecy our apostle gives direction to let two or three </p>
<p>prophets speak and others discern what is spoken. e prophets take turns </p>
<p>one by one uttering what they are prompted by the Spirit to say (14:31), and </p>
<p>other members determine the validity of the prophecy, especially those with </p>
<p>the gi of discernment. at others (more than one) are required to discern </p>
<p>safeguards against false prophecies. Even though prophets are highly ranked </p>
<p>in the body (12:28), their words should be tested and not naively accepted by </p>
<p>virtue of the prophet’s authority. e one who rst prophesies is to be silent </p>
<p>if another one sitting down starts to prophecy. Such conduct avoids the con-</p>
<p>fusing scenario of multiple speakers prophesying at the same time as well as </p>
<p>238. See discussion in Schnabel 2006:830–33.</p>
<p>239. But it probably does not mean that each one interprets: see Ciampa/Rosner </p>
<p>2010:711–12, pace iselton 2000:1131.</p>
