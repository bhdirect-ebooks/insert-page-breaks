<p>Introduction (1:1–9)</p>

<p>given, and doubtless the content of these terms includes prophecy, tongues, </p>
<p>teachings, discernment, and revelations experienced by the Corinthians </p>
<p>(cf. 12:8; 13:1–2; 14:26). His recipients are thus presented with a better way </p>
<p>of perceiving the value of their spiritual gis—these gis come from God, </p>
<p>and this should prompt them to praise their Divine Benefactor instead of </p>
<p>human agents. e use of all, any, always, and everything in these verses </p>
<p>highlights the total and abundant way they have been enriched by God who </p>
<p>works favorably through them. </p>
<p>ey have also received the benet of salvation due to God calling </p>
<p>Paul and sending him to proclaim the gospel, the testimony concerning </p>
<p>Christ (cf. 1:18; 15:1–4). at message was conrmed as eectual among </p>
<p>them by their acceptance of it, conversion, and spiritual gis in which they </p>
<p>now operate. ey receive saving grace as a result of the accomplishments </p>
<p>of Christ’s death and resurrection, and they are being transformed through </p>
<p>their continued fellowship in Christ. e designations of Son, Lord, Christ, </p>
<p>Jesus, or “in him” appear in every verse of 1:1–10, which suggests for Den-</p>
<p>nis Stamps that “a christological premise is an essential part of Christian </p>
<p>rhetoric, particularly as it is practiced by Paul.”</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> </p>
<p>eir relationship in Christ will culminate with Christ conrming </p>
<p>them to be blameless on the day of the Lord.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>at day signies a time</p>
<p>in the prophetic calendar when God will deliver the faithful and judge the </p>
<p>wicked (Isa 13:6–9; Amos 5:18; Joel 2:1, 31; Obad 15). It marks for Paul </p>
<p>the second coming of Jesus and judgment day, when all humans must give </p>
<p>account of their deeds (1:7b–8; 3:13; 4:4b–5; 5:5; cf. 2 Cor 5:10). e im-</p>
<p>age envisioned here is one in which Jesus sits on the tribunal and declares </p>
<p>the Corinthians innocent of anything worthy of eternal punishment. At </p>
<p>that time the sanctication to which they had been called as saints nds </p>
<p>its full realization. </p>
<p>Paul’s thanksgiving ends by stressing that God is faithful, which </p>
recalls divine delity in relation to the covenant people (Deut 7:9; 32:4).

<p> </p>
<p>With this background in view the phrase implies praise and thanks to God </p>
<p>who can be relied on to bless, protect, deliver, and maintain agreements </p>
<p>with His own people. God called them into fellowship with His son Jesus </p>
<p>in wisdom traditions (Prov 22:21; Sir 21:18).</p>

<p>20. To be blameless (ἀνέγκλητος) here means to be without liability; it “belongs </p>
<p>to the semantic domain of accusation and declarative verdict”: iselton 2000:102. See </p>
<p>similarly 1 ess 3:13; 5:23; Col 1:22.</p>
<p>21. is declaration may function as a surrogate for Jewish “blessed be God” prayers </p>
<p>(beraka), such as in the Shemoneh &apos;Esreh prayer. See Sanders 1962:358–59; Ciampa/</p>
