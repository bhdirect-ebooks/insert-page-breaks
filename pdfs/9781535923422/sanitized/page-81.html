<p>Excursus: Interpreting “What is Written” in 4:6</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>teacher’s instructions and not to write “over the lines.”</p>
<p>174</p>
<p>The importance</p>
<p>of elegant handwriting is quite evident in papyri, based on school text com-</p>
<p>ments criticizing poor styles.</p>
<p>175</p>
<p>Unfortunately, like the other possibilities in option 4, the exact phrase </p>
<p>in 4:6 is not found in relevant ancient sources that would conﬁrm this </p>
<p>viewpoint. Nevertheless, if the quote was not normally written down but </p>
<p>understood orally in that culture, evidence for it may be rather difﬁcult to </p>
<p>uncover. Robert Dutch suggests that elitist children may be in view since </p>
<p>poor children would not be afforded the opportunity to write, and if so, </p>
<p>the idea of elitists being puffed up is relevant for the context: “To indicate </p>
<p>that the educated elite need to behave like one learning to write is a put-</p>
<p>down. They would be proud of their education that separated them socially </p>
<p>from the non-elite in the church.”</p>
<p>176</p>
<p>But if so, who among the number</p>
<p>of lower class congregation members, many who might not have received </p>
<p>even an elementary education, would know the saying? Is Paul targeting </p>
<p>here congregants from the upper or at least in-between classes who might </p>
<p>understand him? An afﬁrmative answer to this second question cannot be </p>
<p>ruled out, especially when his auditors are expected to be familiar with the </p>
<p>role of tutors (see 4:15).</p>
<p>Option 5 has its setbacks, too. First, γέγραπται does not introduce a </p>
<p>quotation as it does in Paul’s other citations of Scripture; it is part of the </p>
<p>quotation. Thus, the “not beyond what is written” seems to be a saying </p>
<p>rather than Scripture citation. Second, none of the passages Paul cites ear-</p>
<p>lier mentions being puffed up (φυσιόω). Even so, this notion of being puffed </p>
<p>up is similar to and sometimes used in tandem with boasting, and the </p>
<p>latter term appears in 4:7.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>In Paul’s most immediate citation in 3:20 (Ps</p>
<p>93[94]:11), the term for boasting, καυχάομαι, appears in Ps 93[94]:3, as </p>
<p>well as in Paul’s negative imperative after the reference (3:21). Καυχάομαι </p>
<p>is likewise found in the citation of 1:31 (Jer 9:22–23). Although “these </p>
<p>things” in 4:6 is more concerned with the content of 3:5—4:5, verse 3:21 </p>
<p>may be built on the earlier boasting in 1:31.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p>In 4:6, then, is γέγραπται</p>
