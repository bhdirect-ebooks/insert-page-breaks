<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>163</p>
<p>extra-natural awareness of thoughts, activities, locations, or circumstances </p>
<p>of another person, thing, or group (5:3–4; Acts 5:1–9; Mark 2:6–8; John </p>
<p>1:42, 47–50). Such phenomena, however, seems to be understood by Paul </p>
<p>as one aspect of prophecy, or at least overlapping with it (14:24–25). Hence, </p>
<p>the gi of knowledge may include or perhaps center on the special ability </p>
<p>through the Spirit to communicate truths, insights, and instruction from or </p>
<p>relevant to Scripture and the gospel of Christ (13:2; 14:6; cf. 2 Cor 11:6).</p>
<p>116</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e word of wisdom and knowledge may begin Paul’s gi list to stress that </p>
<p>those endowed with such communication have nothing to boast about </p>
<p>(8:1–3). ey were given these gis by God’s Spirit. </p>
<p>e gi of faith means something dierent than saving faith; oth-</p>
<p>erwise, all believers would have this gi rather than just some. is gi </p>
<p>highlights extraordinary trust in God that eventually experiences the thing </p>
<p>hoped for, oen resulting in the miraculous (cf. 13:2; Mark 11:20–24; Matt </p>
<p>8:23–27; Heb 11). In addition, the ability to work wonders in nature, such </p>
<p>as Jesus calming a storm and feeding 5,000 with a few loaves and shes </p>
<p>(Mark 4:35–41; 6:35–44), may be meant. A group that earnestly and persis-</p>
<p>tently prays together in faith may also experience extraordinary answers to </p>
<p>their requests (Jas 5:15; Acts 12:5–16). Gis of healings would be especially </p>
<p>relevant in Corinth where one of the temples of Asclepius, the savior and </p>
<p>god of healing, resided. Divine healing for early Christians conrms the </p>
<p>Messianic era has arrived in which those who are sick, blind, lame, or suf-</p>
<p>fer some other inrmity can be made whole again (cf. Luke 7:21–22). e </p>
plural “gis” perhaps suggests diverse ways and conditions in which God might heal through various individuals or communities.
<p>117</p>
<p>Not all healings</p>
<p>need to be physical.</p>
<p>e workings of powers may overlap in content with other gis, but </p>
<p>unique here may be the “curse” miracles, such as Peter revealing the sin and </p>
<p>impending death of Ananias and Sapphira or Paul cursing the false prophet </p>
<p>Elymas with temporary blindness (Acts 5:1–11; 13:11).</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>Dierently or in</p>
<p>addition to this function, some suggest this gi refers to authority over these </p>
<p>“powers,” which are malicious. Hence, this gi is the “eective acts over evil </p>
<p>spirits” (15:24; Rom 8:38).</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> Exorcisms similar to the ones Jesus and his dis-</p>
<p>ciples performed might fall into this category (Mark 3:14–15; Luke 9:1–2; </p>
<p>Acts 16:16–18), and perhaps even raising the dead, which exemplies power </p>
<p>116. Although gis of knowledge and teaching might overlap (12:8, 28), they are </p>
<p>distinguished in 14:6. </p>
