<p>Introduction</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>they stirred up alliances which eventually led to Athen’s demise, and in the </p>
<p>Corinthian War that followed they allied with other Greek cities against </p>
<p>Sparta’s expansions. ey fought against Philip II of Macedon at Chaero-</p>
<p>nea, and later joined the Achaean League, which eventually led to their </p>
<p>disaster when opposing Rome. e Roman general, Lucius Mummius, set </p>
<p>the city aame, put to death many of its men, and sold its women and </p>
<p>children into slavery (146 BCE).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bravery, hardship, and heroism in the Corinthian battles were doubt-</p>
<p>less retold by its citizens, things that stand in tension with characterizations </p>
<p>of Corinth as a place of leisure and sexual license. e Acrocorinth’s alleged </p>
<p>thousand sacred prostitutes devoted to Aphrodite, goddess of love (Strabo </p>
<p>Geogr. 8.6.20c), at best seems exaggerated since sacred prostitution was </p>
<p>not customarily a Greek practice.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Aphrodite’s legendary origin from the</p>
<p>foam of the sea, where the god Chronos had cut o the genitals of his father </p>
<p>Ouranus (Hesiod eog. 188–206), casts her in sensual light. But she also </p>
<p>represented beauty, fruitfulness, safe seafaring, and protector of the Cor-</p>
<p>inthians.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Perhaps in this last role the women of Corinth would climb the</p>
Acrocorinth; they begged for “a great and terrifying divine force to inspire
<p>their warriors to overwhelm the horrifying destructive power of war.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> Nev-</p>
<p>ertheless, Corinth did have a licentious reputation. Plutarch mentions an </p>
<p>“army of harlots” in the Acrocorinth (Amatorius 21[767F]), Aristophanes </p>
<p>uses the term korinthiazesthai to refer to practicing sexual immorality (Frag. </p>
<p>354), and Plato seems to equate Corinthian women with sexual promiscu-</p>
<p>ity (Rep. 404D). Although these words come from outsiders and perhaps </p>
<p>promote Athenian propaganda,</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>they are nonetheless complementary with</p>
<p>what we nd in 1 Corinthians. Here more than any of his other letters, Paul </p>
<p>tries to correct the sexual misconduct of congregation members, including </p>
<p>their aairs with prostitutes (1 Cor 5–7; cf. 10:8; 2 Cor 12:21).</p>
<p>6. See e.g., Pausanius Descr. 2.1.2; 7.7.1–16.10; Cassius Dio Hist. Rom. 21[9.31]; </p>
<p>Strabo Geogr. 23a; Salmon 2006:235–37; Murphy-O’Connor 1983:42–43, 49, 63–64.</p>
<p>7. See Lanci 2005:205–20. Dierently, Williams 1986:17–21; Schnabel 2006:22, </p>
<p>suggest imported inuence from Phoenician-Astarte. Pausanius connects Aphrodite’s </p>
<p>cult to Phoenicians (Descr. 1.14.7).</p>
<p>8. See e.g., Hamilton, 1969:32–33.</p>
<p>9. Lanci 2005:220.</p>
<p>10. So Conzelmann 1975:12; Murphy-O’Connor 1983:55–57, 105–6.</p>
