<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>e outcome is that one is hungry and another is drunk. Poor mem-</p>
<p>bers do not get enough to eat while other members eat and drink so much </p>
<p>that they get intoxicated.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> Paul’s exasperated questions that follow rhetori-</p>
<p>cally shame them and substantiate his refusal for praise. ey could eat and </p>
<p>drink at home to curtail their appetites once gathered together, but they </p>
<p>have not done so. eir actions show that they despise the church of God </p>
<p>because they shame those members who have nothing. Paul might agree </p>
<p>with Pliny that impropriety toward guests at meals and unequal portions </p>
<p>of food connote stinginess and extravagance (Ep. 2.6); and with Seneca he </p>
<p>might concur that intoxication is oensive and a type of madness that casts </p>
<p>o restraints to wrongdoing (Lucil. 83.9–27). Our apostle would add, how-</p>
<p>ever, that drunken and greedy persons might jeopardize their inheritance in </p>
<p>God’s kingdom (6:10).</p>
<p>His version of the Last Supper is comparable with what is written later </p>
<p>in the Gospels (11:23–25; Matt 26:17–28; Mark 14:12–25; Luke 22:17–23).</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even though Paul received these words from the Lord, it does not appear </p>
<p>to be from direct revelation but a recollection of Jesus’s words passed on </p>
<p>to him orally by the Lord’s earliest disciples. at this happened on the </p>
<p>night he was betrayed (παραδίδωμι) grounds the tradition in an actual </p>
<p>event—Jesus’s arrest that led to his crucixion.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>All four Gospels describe</p>
<p>his betrayal and arrest repeatedly using παραδίδωμι, the same word Paul </p>
<p>uses (e.g., Mark 14:10; Matt 26:15; Luke 22:4; John 18:5).</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> Among the vari-</p>
<p>ous types of meals that might have inuenced this tradition, the Passover </p>
<p>is the most signicant (Exod 12).</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>Paul himself is informed by this feast as</p>
<p>he calls Christ the Passover lamb and associates the third cup of wine at the </p>
<p>Seder meal aer supper with the “cup of blessing” served at the Lord’s table </p>
<p>(see 5:5–7; 10:16; m. Pes. 10:1–7). Likewise, the repetitive command of Jesus </p>
<p>71. Smith 2010a:527, suggests drunkenness here is a metonymy for gluttony, but </p>
<p>wine appears to be plentiful at the meal and drunkenness is stressed as a vice (5:11; </p>
<p>6:10).</p>
<p>72. See theories related to parallel wording in Marshall 1993:30–56. Unique idioms </p>
<p>suggest Paul did not originate this tradition (Jeremias 1966:101–5).</p>
<p>73. On the Last Supper’s historicity, see Fitzmyer 2008:430.</p>
<p>74. God “handing over” Jesus to redemption on the cross is not the primary mean-</p>
<p>ing, pace Works 2014:94; Smith 2003:188; the crucixion did not happen on that night. </p>
<p>See problems with other interpretations of παραδίδωμι in Oropeza, 2010:342–45. Paul </p>
<p>likely knew the betrayer’s name, but the tradition he unfolds centers on Jesus (not Judas) </p>
<p>and what Jesus says about the last supper. Hence, for this tradition (and Paul) to include </p>
<p>Judas’s name would be digressive. Moreover, the shame of mentioning an apostate who </p>
<p>was formerly one of Jesus’s closest disciples may have also been another deterrent for </p>
<p>not including Judas’s name (see Oropeza 2011:144–45).</p>
<p>75. See iselton 2000:871–74; Oropeza 2004:49–57.</p>
