<p>48</p>
<p>But if Paul was perceived negatively, his</p>
<p>weakness extends beyond preaching and persona to include also what he </p>
<p>personally experienced as a result of his preaching.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> In Corinth Paul appar-</p>
<p>ently feared external opposition to his messages (Acts 18:9–13). Likewise, </p>
<p>personal inadequacies both on and o stage may have plagued him due to </p>
<p>this city’s size, reputation, Roman inuence, and potpourri of intimidating </p>
<p>people (cf. 1 Cor 16:10).</p>
<p>Raymond Pickett rightly arms that our apostle takes on the pos-</p>
<p>ture of someone who “deliberately failed to measure up to the standards </p>
<p>of rhetorical excellence.”</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>His self-deprecation in 2:1–4a has the aim of</p>
<p>subverting Corinthian adoration of human wisdom in 2:4b–5 branded by </p>
<p>orators whose method of operation centered on forceful rhetorical demon-</p>
<p>strations.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>Dierently, Paul’s proclamation involved demonstration of the</p>
<p>powerful Spirit.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>His preaching connoted “proof consisting in possession</p>
<p>of the Holy Spirit and miracle-working power.”</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> e Corinthians are to re-</p>
<p>call such phenomena so that their faith may not rest in clever human wis-</p>
<p>dom, but in the power of God.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>It is through the apostle’s weakness that</p>
<p>spiritual power is greatly manifest. Power in weakness reects Christ’s own </p>
<p>crucixion, which gave way to resurrection and becomes the catalyst un-</p>
<p>leashing God’s Spirit on Christ’s followers to convict, transform, and work </p>
<p>miracles among them. Paul’s messages possess such power, which become </p>
tokens of the divine authenticity of his ministry and apostleship (1 ess
<p>1:5; 2:13; Gal 3:5; Rom 15:18–19; cf. 1 Cor 4:20–21).</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>ese words promote</p>
<p>a dierent kind of wisdom in which miracle and prophetic discourse are </p>

<p>49. In 2:3, γίνομαι in “I was with you . . . ” describes his state of being rather than </p>
<p>speaking.</p>

<p>51. On δύναμις as the power of persuading, e.g., Aristotle Rhet. 1.6.14; Quintilian </p>
<p>Inst. 2.15.3–4; for ἀπόδειξις as rhetorical demonstration, e.g., Aristotle Rhet. 1.1.11; </p>
<p>Quintilian Inst. 5.10.7; Weiss 1910:50.</p>
<p>52. “Spirit and power” is a hendiadys (“powerful Spirit”): Lindemann 2000:56; Sch-</p>
<p>nabel 2006:156.</p>

<p>54. is demonstration informs the meaning of “faith” (πίστις) in 2:5. In rhetorical </p>
<p>discourses πίστις was oen understood as “proof” (πίστις): cf. Isocates Or. 3.8; Aristotle </p>
<p>Rhet. 1.1.14–2.2; Acts 17:31; LSJ 1408. And here a double entendre is in view (Winter </p>
<p>2002:161, 163)</p>
<p>55. Gräbe 2008:61–66, rightly includes this charismatic emphasis. at Acts 18:1–</p>
<p>18 records no miracle of Paul in Corinth (Riddlebarger 2013:55–56) is no evidence that </p>
<p>Paul is not including signs and wonders here, especially when elsewhere he claims he </p>
<p>did perform miracles when with them (2 Cor 12:12).</p>
