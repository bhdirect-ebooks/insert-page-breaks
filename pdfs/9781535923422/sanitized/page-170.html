<p>not be ogling over her since her head would be signaling masculinity in-</p>
<p>stead of femininity. e short unveiled hair, however, may also convey a </p>
<p>wrong message about her, one of shame whether related to humiliation, </p>
<p>punishment for adultery, or a taking away from her femininity (11:5b; Aris-</p>
<p>tophanes esm. 837–38; Tacitus Germ. 19; Dio Chrysostom Or. 64.3; Lu-</p>
<p>cian Fug. 27).</p>

<p>e solution of a shaved head, then, seems to be said almost</p>
<p>as a reductio ad absurdum to persuade them to the more sensible alternative </p>
<p>of wearing head coverings. </p>
<p>Paul alludes to the story of Adam and Eve, not to address the woman’s </p>
<p>subordination to the man,</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>but to show gender distinction as part of the</p>
<p>created order. e man ought not to cover his head since he is the image </p>
<p>and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man. is sounds similar </p>
<p>to Gen 1:26–27, but in the passage “glory” is not mentioned and “man” </p>
<p>(ἄνθρωπος) refers to human beings, male and female, who both are created </p>
<p>in God’s image.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>Paul seems to adopt the “image of God” from this passage</p>
<p>and then reads into it the meaning of Adam being created rst and then </p>
<p>Eve aerward from Adam’s rib (Gen 2:7, 18–23). He apparently interpreted </p>
<p>Gen 2 as further explication of Gen 1.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>From this perspective it seems that</p>
<p>Adam is unique among humans because he was made from the dust of the </p>
<p>earth without any human contribution, unlike Eve, and God’s image was </p>
<p>then passed from Adam to Eve and to their children aerward (11:8–9; </p>
<p>cf. Gen 5:1–3).</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>is image may be understood as a visible representation</p>
<p>of the otherwise unseen God, and glory may depict that manifestation in </p>
terms of certain divine attributes (e.g., power, mercy, love); the man mir-rors the divine by exhibiting God’s attributes.
<p>32</p>
<p>is glory is also a sign of</p>
<p>honor (see Mal 1:6). As Fee suggests, “the existence of the one brings honor </p>
<p>and praise to the other. By creating man in his own image God set his own </p>
<p>glory in man. Man, therefore exists to God’s praise and honor, and is to </p>
<p>live in relationship to God so as to be his ‘glory’.”</p>

<p>29. Possibly Paul includes “glory” because he, like LXX translators, interprets the </p>
<p>“likeness” (ה ָנמ ְ) of God from Hebrew as “glory” (δόξα) in Greek (Num 12:8; Ps </p>
<p>17[16]:15; Wire 1990:120, 279). Gen 1:26, however, uses תמ ְ and ὁμοιόω, respectively, </p>
for “likeness.” On the divine image in Jewish sources, see van Kooten 2008:1–91.
<p>30. Paul does not seem to read Gen 1 and 2 here as two distinct creation sources.</p>
<p>31. See Ciampa/Rosner 2010:524. Alternatively, Paul knew the woman was created </p>
<p>in God’s image but does not mention it because it would obstruct his argumentative </p>
<p>goal (Gundry-Volf 1997:156).</p>
