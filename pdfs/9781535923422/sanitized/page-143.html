<p>so apostles may eat from their own missionary eorts. Paul seems</p>
<p>to know an oral tradition arming that when the Lord Jesus sent out his </p>
<p>disciples to evangelize, he instructed them that those who proclaim the </p>
<p>gospel get their living from the gospel (cf. Matt 10:10; Luke 10:7; 1 Tim </p>
<p>5:17–18). Paul reinterprets this instruction as a right he could give up rather </p>
<p>than a command that he must keep.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>Although he risks the impression of</p>
<p>distancing himself from authorized practice,</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>he doubtless believes that</p>
<p>expediting the gospel at no charge so that more lives might be saved would </p>
<p>be endorsed by Jesus. </p>
<p>His determination to continue in this practice is emphasized by using </p>
<p>pathos (9:15–18). Paul has not used these rights and does not want to use </p>
<p>them now; in fact; it is good for me rather to die than . . . no one will emp-</p>
<p>ty my boasting!</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>Our apostle cuts o his sentence (known as aposiopesis),</p>
<p>which prevents us from knowing how the original sentence would nish. </p>
<p>Garland reasonably suggests the completion as, “it is better for me rather </p>
<p>to die than to live o the gospel.”</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>is hyperbole stresses rm conviction</p>
<p>against receiving nancial support (cf. 2 Cor 11:10). His boasting here is </p>
<p>not in self-adulation but in what his free gospel accomplishes for the cause </p>
<p>of Christ. As such, it anticipates a reward for his preaching that is paradoxi-</p>
<p>cally to be paid by the Lord and yet involuntary.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>Regarding the latter, Paul</p>
<p>perceives his calling as prophetic (Gal 1:15–16; cf. Jer 1:4–10; Isa 42:1–10), </p>
<p>and his compulsion to preach echoes a commission in which the prophet </p>
encounters divine constraint to fulll the task at hand regardless of per-
<p>sonal shortcomings (Jer 1:4–10; 20:7–10; Isa 8:11; Amos 3:7–8; Exod 3–4).</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul’s expression, woe to me if I proclaim not the gospel reects prophetic </p>
formulae anticipating great lament or divine judgment if he fails to fulll
<p>his vocation (cf. Isa 5:8–22; 6:5; Jer 15:10; Hos 7:13; Amos 6:1; Luke 22:22).</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Persuaded by his own encounter with the Lord (9:1), he is thus compelled </p>
<p>to fulll his calling, which for him precludes any other choice but to align </p>
himself with the divine purpose for his life. For all practical purposes, then,
