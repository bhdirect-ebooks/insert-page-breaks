<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>156</p>
<p>and with Christ’s unselsh giving as a model for them to follow in relation </p>
<p>to poor members who attend the supper.</p>
<p>Seeing, then, that the meal proclaims Jesus’s death, those who con-</p>
<p>sume these elements in an unworthy manner will be held accountable </p>
<p>for the Lord’s body and blood. Garland rightly suggests that “those whose </p>
<p>behavior at the Lord’s Supper does not conform to what that death entails </p>
<p>eectively shi sides. ey leave the Lord’s side and align themselves with </p>
<p>the rulers of this present age who crucied the Lord.”</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>If Christ is spiritually</p>
<p>present as the Lord honored at this meal (see 10:16–21), the Corinthians are </p>
<p>to discern the reality of Christ’s body present with them (11:29). ough </p>
<p>as Peter-Ben Smit arms, the term is multivalent: “e ‘body’ is both a </p>
<p>designation of the bread broken at the Lord’s Supper, a reference to Christ’s </p>
<p>body, and a designation of the community qua body of Christ. . . . Whoever </p>
<p>shames the poor members . . . oends both the community as a body and </p>
<p>Christ, whose body is at stake as both the content (the bread broken) and </p>
<p>the context (the community) of the Lord’s Supper.”</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>e Corinthians, then,</p>
<p>must not regard the bread and cup in a mundane sense as merely food and </p>
<p>drink.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>Before they partake, they must examine themselves. Examination</p>
<p>was crucial for sacred meals, as an Athenian inscription from the second </p>
<p>century (CE) evinces: “It is not lawful for anyone to enter this holy assembly </p>
<p>of banqueters before being examined to see whether they are holy and godly </p>
<p>and good.”</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>Paul, however, hires no church policeman to do this; rather,</p>
<p>each worshipper is to examine themselves to determine their own character, </p>
<p>deciencies, and state of righteousness.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>Self-examination should have the result of a positive change of </p>
<p>behavior,</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>and would help avoid the Lord’s judgment. Many are physically</p>
<p>weak and sick, and a number of them are falling asleep in death.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>Some</p>
<p>possible culprits for these calamities include the current food shortage (see </p>
<p>7:26), drunkenness, gluttony, food poisoning, or a plague.</p>

<p>86. e adjective ἱκανός (“many” NKJV) might suggest a large amount of deaths, </p>
<p>possibly from an epidemic (Murphy-O’Connor 2009:228–29). But if rendered “a num-</p>
<p>ber” or “enough,” the amount is unspecied (see options in LSJ 825). I suggest that </p>
<p>some already died while others might be close to death. With ἱκανός perhaps Paul plays </p>
<p>up the number for rhetorical eect.</p>
