<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>might convey satanic power over the world (cf. 1 Cor 5:5; 2 Cor 4:4),</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>but in</p>
<p>this context it stresses the ideology of the present age epitomized by elitism </p>
<p>that values human power, high status, and clever speech. At conversion the </p>
<p>confessors received God’s Spirit, not this ideology (12:13; Rom 8:9). ere is </p>
<p>an implicit exhortation from this that since the Corinthians value this ideol-</p>
ogy, they lack the spiritual maturity needed to fully appreciate divine wis-
<p>dom. e Spirit enables believers to know the gis granted us by God. is </p>
<p>phrase points back to 2:9.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>ose who have God’s Spirit can understand</p>
<p>and receive all kinds of salvic blessings, not the least of which are wisdom </p>
<p>from and fellowship with God. Not only does God’s Spirit reveal wisdom </p>
<p>but it also takes an active role as its teacher.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>e Spirit, it seems, prompts</p>
<p>and works with the mode of communication Christian teachers like Paul </p>
<p>employ as they connect with others. e Spirit helps supply the teachers’ </p>
<p>words, which then become a powerful tool for persuasion. Such teaching </p>
<p>is eective not because of the teachers’ rhetorical talents but because they </p>
<p>are Spirit-led and committed to the task of interpreting spiritual things to </p>
<p>those who possess the Spirit.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>Spirit-inspired words, then, contrast words</p>
<p>taught by clever human wisdom, and this identies a second antithesis. In </p>
<p>2:13 λόγος (speech/word) and σοφία (wisdom) are again combined as in </p>
<p>1:17, 2:1, 4, this time to contrast rhetorical education with the Spirit’s wise </p>
<p>and transformative teaching disclosures.</p>
<p>A third antithesis compares the natural (soulish) person (ψυχικός), </p>
<p>with the extra-natural (spiritual) person (πνευματικός). e former is </p>
<p>natural in the sense of being created human with the life principle, like </p>
<p>Adam (Gen 2:7; cf. 1 Cor 15:44–46), but without revelatory abilities com-</p>
<p>ing from God’s Spirit.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>e point is that the in-breaking of God’s Spirit in</p>
<p>the present age has brought about a new condition in which the natural </p>
<p>person’s thoughts are rendered insucient for spiritual purposes. It is only </p>
with the aid of God’s Spirit that spiritual things (e.g., divine truths, insights,
<p>gis, and revelation) can be discerned. e natural person does not accept </p>
<p>these things; they are foolishness to him, just like the message of the cross. </p>
<p>is person cannot understand because spiritual things are examined and </p>
<p>understood spiritually.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>On the other hand, the spiritual person (i.e., the</p>
<p>86. See Vos 1996:110; Meyer 1877:1.69.</p>
<p>87. Fee 1987:113, rightly compares neuter plurals in both verses.</p>
<p>88. See Frestadius 2011:66–67. On God as teacher see Isa 54:13. </p>
<p>89. For various renditions of “πνευματικοῖς πνευματικὰ συγκρίνοντες,” see BDAG </p>
<p>953.</p>
<p>90. See Fitzmyer 2008:182–84.</p>
<p>91. In 2:14 the singular verb ἀνακρίνεται takes on a neuter plural subject (cf. Wal-</p>
<p>lace 1996:399–400), and what is discerned are the things of God’s Spirit, not the natural </p>
