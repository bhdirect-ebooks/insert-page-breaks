<p>Closing Matters (1 Cor 16:1–24)</p>
<p>e closing content of ancient letters commonly discuss business aairs, </p>
<p>travel plans, or announcement of visitations, as in 16:1–12.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>At the same</p>
<p>time, Paul may be responding to a Corinthian request for Apollos and </p>
<p>inquiries about how to administrate the collection Paul recently imple-</p>
<p>mented. In rhetorical messages the peroratio section identies the arrange-</p>
<p>ment’s conclusion and oen highlights pathos and recapitulation, among </p>
<p>other features.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Paul’s words in 16:13–24 recapitulates some of the letter’s</p>
<p>earlier exhortation topics in nuce (16:13–14) and prompts pathos by a </p>
<p>fearful warning (16:22). More signicantly, this letter shares closing con-</p>
<p>ventions in 16:13–24 in common with other ancient letters, notably Paul’s </p>
<p>own, which add nal appeals, greetings, something written by Paul’s own </p>
<p>hand, a holy kiss and prayer-wish or doxology, and a nal benediction (2 </p>
<p>Cor 13:11–13; Gal 6:11–18; 1 ess 5:23–28; 2 ess 3:16–18; Col 4:7–18; </p>
<p>Rom 16:16–27).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>We do need to decide between an epistolary or rhetorical</p>
<p>close. Anders Eriksson rightly asserts that if rhetoric is regarded “as a theory </p>
<p>studying persuasive structures in a text, it can be used to analyze rhetorical </p>
<p>features, not only in texts which are the result of a conscious application </p>
<p>of that learned theory, but for all oral and written productions that have </p>
<p>persuasive [features].”</p>

<p>The Collection and Announcement of Visits (16:1–12)</p>
<p>Paul again introduces new topics with the words, now concerning (16:1, </p>
<p>12; cf. 7:1, 25; 8:1; 12:1). e closing business matter concerns the collec-</p>
<p>tion for the saints. We learn from 2 Cor 8:6, 10, that Paul rst sent Titus </p>
<p>to Corinth for this task.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>He normally identies saints as Christ’s followers</p>

<p>he wrote 1 Corinthians, though obviously Titus introduced the collection a little earlier. </p>
