<p>Avoiding Sexual Deﬁlement: </p>
<p>Second Supporting Proof (5:1—7:<span class="_ _1" /><span class="ff8">4<span class="_ _1" />0<span class="_ _1" /></span>)</p>
<p>e second proof for congregational unity focuses on membership soli-</p>
<p>darity as a corporate body in Christ, a cohesion that is being threatened </p>
<p>primarily by sexual aliations with outsiders (5:1–7:40). is section be-</p>
<p>gins with further reporting, probably again through Chloe’s household (cf. </p>
<p>1:11), that one of the congregants is guilty of gross sexual misconduct. e </p>
<p>problem requires swi judgment (5:1 –13), which then leads to a discus-</p>
<p>sion on intra-member court litigations (6:1–11) before returning to another </p>
<p>matter related to sexual misconduct (6:12–20). Together these units form a </p>
<p>small chiasm with the center reecting on what might be called a “rhetorical </p>
<p>interlude.”</p>

<p> Sexual Misconduct Related to Prostitution (6:12–20)</p>
<p>Other sexual and domestic matters are then addressed, prompted by ques-</p>
<p>tions from the Corinthian letter being read to Paul (7:1–40). </p>
<p>The Fornicator’s Expulsion (5:1 –8)</p>
<p>Paul uses irony and shame to incite pathos and stir the congregation re-</p>
<p>garding their sexual misconduct before participating in the expulsion of </p>
<p>the culprit (5:1–5). Aer this he explains through Passover tradition how </p>
<p>the expulsion will benet membership purity (5:6–8). e passage opens </p>
<p>by conveying a sense of astonishment—it is actually reported that there </p>
<p>is fornication among you.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>One of the members is having a sexual aair</p>
<p>with his father’s wife (the stepmother), an action that Paul condemns based </p>
<p>on Mosaic sex codes (Lev 18:7–8; Deut 22:30[23:1LXX]; 27:20; m. Sanh. </p>
<p>1. Malcolm 2013b:65, 121.</p>
<p>2. ough here incest, fornication (πορνεία) is an umbrella term in Scripture for </p>
<p>dierent types of sexual deviances: see Oropeza 2006:27–63.</p>
