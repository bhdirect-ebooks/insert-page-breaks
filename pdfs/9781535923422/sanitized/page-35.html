<p>Introduction (1:1–9)</p>
<p>Paul’s letters generally follow the opening conventions of ancient epistles, </p>
<p>and this letter is no exception. Its prescript identies the sender and recipi-</p>
<p>ents, and gives a greeting to those recipients (1:1–3). His thanksgiving in 1:4 </p>
<p>begins the letter’s proem, a rhetorical convention that includes introductory </p>
<p>matters attempting to gain the auditors’ goodwill, attention, and receptiv-</p>
<p>ity (1:1–9).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>With this letter strategy intact, they might be receptive to the</p>
<p>apostle’s corollary teachings and exhortations. </p>
<p>Letter Prescript (1:1–3)</p>
<p>Paul introduces himself as one who is called to be an apostle. He is sent out </p>
<p>as a travelling envoy and witness of the risen savior to proclaim this good </p>
<p>news about him to Gentile nations. His calling to this vocation is dependable </p>
<p>because it was not given through self-appointment but through the will of </p>
<p>God (Gal 1:15—2:10; Acts 22:3–21). Paul stresses his apostleship in order to </p>
<p>buttress his authority before the recipients.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>He must gain their respect if he</p>
<p>is to succeed in challenging them to abandon wrong behaviors and ideolo-</p>
<p>gies. At the same time his calling also displays power in weakness related to </p>
<p>the cross (1 Cor 1:21; 4:9–13).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>His authority is thus rooted in Christ-like</p>
<p>service, suering, and humility rather than in arrogance or attempts to rule </p>
<p>over the congregation. Sosthenes is the co-sender and probable coauthor.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>He may be the same synagogue leader who originally opposed Paul during </p>
<p>his rst visit to Corinth (Acts 18:17). But if so, it is strange that Acts fails to </p>
<p>mention this synagogue leader’s conversion. Sosthenes is not necessarily a </p>
<p>unique name for that time, and so we cannot be sure this is the same person </p>
<p>1. See Aristotle Rhet. 3.14.1; Kennedy 1984:23–24.</p>
<p>2. e.g., 2 Cor 1:1; Gal 1:1; Weiss 1910:2.</p>
<p>3. See iselton 2000:66–67.</p>
<p>4. If Sosthenes is Paul’s amanuensis, this would be unusual because secretaries are </p>
<p>frequently anonymous and do not appear as coauthors (see Richards 2004:105). e </p>
<p>secretary’s mention in Rom 16:22 appears at the end (not beginning) of that letter.</p>
