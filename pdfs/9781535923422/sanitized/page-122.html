<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>98</p>
<p>thus challenged to be obedient to Christ and not let family, work, habits, </p>
<p>circumstances, or anything else get in the way of that. As iselton puts </p>
<p>it, “A Christian does not have to seek ‘the right situation’ in order to enjoy </p>
<p>Christian freedom or to serve God’s call eectively.”</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>In diatribe fashion Paul poses the questions, Was anyone called being </p>
<p>circumcised? . . . Has anyone been called in uncircumcision?, and then </p>
<p>answers with exhortations for both not to attempt changing their present </p>
<p>condition.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>Since Jews and Gentile proselytes in the church were already</p>
<p>circumcised,</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>they are charged to not do an epispasm, the pulling of their</p>
<p>foreskin back over their penis.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p>Some of these members possibly desired</p>
<p>status upgrades through uncircumcision (circumcision would be generally </p>
<p>ridiculed by their Gentile compatriots). ere is no good reason, however, </p>
<p>why Paul would need to discourage uncircumcised Gentiles from getting </p>
<p>circumcised.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p>e Corinthian congregation is not legalistic regarding</p>
<p>Mosaic Law; they already accept Paul’s circumcision-free gospel.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p>Paul’s</p>
<p>exhortation, then, may not reect an actual conict in this congregation; he </p>
<p>may simply be teaching this precept because he does so in all his churches, </p>
<p>some of which do struggle with Mosaic Law (7:17d; cf. Gal 5:6; 6:15).</p>
<p>158</p>
<p>Both circumcision and uncircumcision amount to nothing for Paul; </p>
<p>what matters is keeping the commands of God. is saying is contrary </p>
<p>to Mosaic Law, since circumcision is prescribed and assumed in the To-</p>
<p>rah and constituted by God (Lev 12:3; Gen 17:9–14).</p>
<p>159</p>
<p>For Israel, keeping</p>
<p>God’s commands includes circumcision. Which commands does Paul refer </p>
<p>to if he discourages his Gentile converts from keeping circumcision and </p>
<p>the works of the Law, and believes the Ten Commandments are being set </p>
<p>aside in Christ (2 Cor 3:3–16; Gal 2:16; 3:10–25; Rom 3:20; cf. 1 Cor 15:56)? </p>
<p>Fee suggests that he must be assuming ethical “imperatives” of “Christian </p>
<p>152. iselton 2000:545.</p>
<p>153. See the diatribe pattern of inquiries and responses in Seneca Tranq. 4.3–4; </p>
<p>Epictetus Ench. 15; Deming 1995:159–64. </p>
<p>154. Acts 18:1–8 complements this view.</p>
<p>155. See 1 Macc 1:14–15; Josephus Ant. 12.241; T.Mos. 8.3.</p>
<p>156. Ciampa/Rosner 2010:311, suggest a Jew-Gentile marriage in the congregation, </p>
<p>but this is quite questionable.</p>
<p>157. ere is no evidence of Torah-abiding opponents in the Corinthian church </p>
<p>(see Oropeza 2016:232–38).</p>
<p>158. Notice also Paul’s change from generic third person singulars in 7:18–19, </p>
<p>which t well with his maxims in 7:17, 20, 22, 24, to his more personalized second </p>
<p>person singulars and plurals when addressing slaves in 7:21, 23.</p>
