<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>war. e next set depicts more missionary experiences, including violent </p>
<p>opposition by being brutally treated, perpetual travelling and thus being </p>
<p>homeless, and Paul toiling as a tentmaker by laboring with his own hands </p>
<p>to support himself (cf. 2 Cor 4:9; 6:4–5; 11:23–25; Acts 18:3). e next triad </p>
<p>reects apostolic responses to experiencing injustices. When Paul and his </p>
<p>team are verbally abused, they bless the revilers in return; when they are </p>
<p>persecuted, they endure whatever aiction takes place as a result; and </p>
<p>when they are slandered, they attempt to conciliate in a friendly manner </p>
<p>(cf. 2 Cor 6:6–8). ese responses resemble the voice of Jesus who urges his </p>
<p>followers to do good to those who hate them, bless those who curse them, </p>
<p>and pray for those who mistreat them (cf. Luke 6:27–28).</p>
<p>198</p>
<p>e list ends in hyperbolic language with the apostles having become </p>
<p>the refuse of the world and o-scouring of all things. ese words might </p>
<p>describe the waste and lth that is scrapped away from whatever is cleansed </p>
<p>from a utensil. But given that 4:9 forms an inclusio with 4:13 with the paral-</p>
<p>lel phrase, “we have become . . . to/of the world,” the grisly remains of the </p>
<p>earlier captives of war, this time aer the spectacle is over, may be foremost </p>
<p>in view. Paul’s audience might envision the remains of the apostle’s dead </p>
<p>body aer being mauled by beasts, burned, crucied, slaughtered, or other-</p>
<p>wise mutilated.</p>
<p>199</p>
<p>ese remains are thrown out as refuse to be le exposed</p>
<p>on the street or at the dumpsite where they rot away and are eaten by ver-</p>
<p>min instead of given proper burial. Paul’s words nonetheless may reect </p>
<p>a double entendre—the nearly synonymous “refuse” (περικάθαρμα) and </p>
<p>“o-scouring” (περίψημα) sometimes have cultic meaning in which they </p>
<p>become the means of purication by virtue of their removal (e.g., Prov 21:8; </p>
<p>Tob 5:19).</p>
<p>200</p>
<p>Paul’s bodily remains may be thus perceived both as a dead and</p>
<p>mangled stench of esh and, similar to Christ, as a sacricial oering that </p>
<p>puries those who come to faith. His imagery alternates from utter defeat </p>
<p>through the world’s eyes to ultimate victory through heaven’s eyes. Among </p>
<p>the many aicted sages in Hellenistic tradition and righteous and prophetic </p>
<p>suerers in Jewish tradition, Paul patterns his own suering most pointedly </p>
<p>aer Jesus Christ. As Christ sacriced his life by suering on the cross so </p>
<p>that others might be cleansed from sin, Paul daily sacrices his life, suering </p>
<p>as a missionary in order to proclaim the message of the cross. </p>
<p>Although our apostle expresses these things not wanting to shame the </p>
<p>Corinthians (4:14), this is what his language nevertheless does. His primary </p>
<p>goal at any rate is to admonish and correct them as his beloved children, and </p>
