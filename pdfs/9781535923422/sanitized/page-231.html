<p>also be raised bodily. Jacob iessen explains an early Christian tradition </p>
<p>that Paul may assume: </p>
<p>According to the account in Acts God’s Spirit was “poured out” </p>
<p>(cf. Acts 2:33) 50 days aer Jesus’ resurrection on the rst day </p>
<p>of Pentecost or Feast of Weeks (cf. Acts 2:1), the very day on </p>
<p>which the “rstfruits” of the wheat harvest were to be dedicated </p>
<p>to God (cf. Exod 34:22; Lev 23:16–25; Num 28:26; Deut 16:9f.) </p>
<p>Since this “outpouring,” God’s Spirit is leading people to faith </p>
<p>in Jesus and is gathering them as “rstfruits” (cf. 1 Cor 16:15; 2 </p>
<p>ess 2:13; Jas 1:18; Rev 14:4). He furthermore is the guarantee </p>
<p>of their bodily resurrection (Rom 8:10f; 2 Cor 1:22; 5:5; Eph </p>
<p>1:14,19f) and thus of the eschatological “harvest.”</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ose who are of Christ represent the harvest’s remainder and are </p>
<p>next in the order of events related to resurrection; they will be raised at </p>
<p>his (Christ’s) second coming. e dead in Christ apparently precede those </p>
<p>who are still alive at that time (15:51–52; 1 ess 4:13–17). Paul’s use of </p>
<p>this “coming” (παρουσία) imagines a pompous entrance of Christ as a </p>
<p>king.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>is depiction recalls another triumphal procession (cf. 15:57), but</p>
<p>this time the Messiah is not the condemned criminal bearing his cross </p>
<p>under the mighty power of Rome as in 1:18, but the triumphal general </p>
<p>who subdues Rome, Caesar, kings, and all other rulers and authorities, </p>
<p>whether in the heavens or on earth (15:24–28; cf. 2:6–8; Rom 8:38; 16:20; </p>
<p>Col 1:16; Eph 6:12; Dan 7:10–14). For Paul this takes place at the end of </p>
<p>human history.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>If there is any time lapse between the second coming</p>
<p>and the end, it would seem to be set aside for defeating every oppositional </p>
<p>power, including death (15:53–55 cf. 1 ess 1:10; 5:1–8; 2 ess 1:6–10; </p>
<p>2:8). Presumably, judgment day also takes place at this time even though </p>
<p>Paul does not mention it here (4:4–5; 6:2–3; 2 Cor 5:10).</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>A chiasm is</p>
<p>detectable in 15:24–28:</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>A “when . . . ” (15:24a)</p>
<p>B “when . . . all/every” (15:24b)</p>
<p>C “for . . . all . . . under his feet” (15:25)</p>

<p>51. Here τέλος should be interpreted temporally as the “end” (cf. 1:8; Fitzmyer </p>
<p>2008:571), not as the “rest” so as to make a third group raised from the dead.</p>
<p>52. Paul does not explain here what happens to the dead prior to any of these events; </p>
<p>that subject is reserved for 2 Cor 5:1–8 (see Oropeza 2016:304–29).</p>
