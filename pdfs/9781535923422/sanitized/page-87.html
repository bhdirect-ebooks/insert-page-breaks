<p>problem of being an absent father, and so he must send Timothy to Corinth </p>
<p>for proxy parental duties (cf. 16:10–11).</p>
<p>210</p>
<p>Timothy, one of Paul’s converts,</p>
<p>reects a prime example of this sort of parent-child imitation; he will help </p>
<p>reinforce Corinthian imitation of Paul’s moral standards and patterns of </p>
<p>conduct in Christ.</p>
<p>211</p>
<p>Such values are taught by Paul in every church, and</p>
<p>the Corinthians should not think themselves an exception. </p>
<p>Paul concludes this section by promising his own follow-up visit to </p>
<p>Corinth (4:18–21; cf. 16:3–7). at some members have become arrogant </p>
<p>as though I were not coming to you recalls Corinthian attitudes in 4:6–7. </p>
<p>ey are like children who are le alone and suppose that they will get away </p>
<p>with their misbehavior because the parent is not present. ose who are </p>
<p>critical of Paul, presumably those who do not regard him as their spiritual </p>
<p>parent, may not have thought he was coming back at all.</p>
<p>212</p>
<p>Paul mentions his</p>
<p>coming as a way to deate their arrogance—he will set things right, that is, if </p>
the Lord permits him to visit. ese inated individuals will encounter the
<p>Spirit’s power that works mightily through the apostle (2:4–5), and a simi-</p>
<p>lar power had better work through them because their bombastic talking </p>
<p>will get them nowhere on that day! e aphorism in 4:20 is not exhaustive </p>
<p>in denition but expresses an important feature relevant to this context:</p>
<p>213</p>
<p> </p>
<p>the kingdom of God that is being revealed to them is not characterized by </p>
<p>clever words but the Spirit’s power that works miracles and transforms lives.</p>
<p>In prospect of Paul’s return, the Corinthians must now decide how </p>
<p>to behave; the result of their choice will determine Paul’s actions when he </p>
<p>arrives. If they follow his exhortations, he will visit them with the parental </p>
<p>aections of love and an attitude of gentleness. If they persist in arrogance, </p>
<p>he will discipline them with a metaphoric rod of correction. Fathers in pa-</p>
<p>triarchal homes were expected to physically discipline their children, even </p>
<p>with a stick (Prov 22:15; 2 Sam 7:14; Philo, Spec. Leg. 2.231–32). In wisdom </p>
<p>discourse this was not considered abusive but reected instead God’s love as </p>
<p>a disciplining Father (Prov 3:11 –12; Sir 30:1–2).</p>
<p>214</p>
<p>In like manner, teachers</p>
<p>and tutors punished students in order to improve their learning.</p>
<p>215</p>
<p>Both</p>
<p>father and teacher roles enable Paul’s metaphor of the disciplining rod, but </p>
<p>the former has more authority here. What type of punishment might Paul </p>
