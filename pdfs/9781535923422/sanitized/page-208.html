<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>184</p>
<p>However, if the structure follows the A, B, A, B pattern below, “so then” in </p>
<p>A explicates tongues only in A</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>, whereas prophecy in B is corrected by the </p>
<p>“but” in B</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>:</p>
<p>A “So then” (ὥστε) connects the citation with tongues as a negative sign </p>
<p>for unbelievers (14:22a)</p>
<p>228</p>
<p>B “But” (δέ) guides what the Corinthians’ (incorrectly) believe: that </p>
<p>prophecy is not for unbelievers (14:22b)</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“erefore” (οὖν) guides an elaboration on tongues as a negative sign</p>
<p>for unbelievers (14:23)</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> “But” (δέ) guides an elaboration on prophecy that amends Corin-</p>
<p>thian belief in B: Prophecy can make unbelievers become believers </p>
<p>(14:24–25)</p>
<p>Among other explanations,</p>
<p>229</p>
<p>another possibility worth mentioning is</p>
<p>the view that Paul did not intend that the eects of prophecy and tongues </p>
<p>be mutually exclusive in relation to believers and unbelievers. His rhetori-</p>
<p>cal momentum leaves behind tight logic as he makes 14:22b symmetrical </p>
<p>with 14:22a. Hays suggests that Paul is really saying that “prophecy is not </p>
<p>[primarily] for unbelievers but for believers.”</p>
<p>230</p>
<p>If the word “sign” is implied</p>
<p>in 14:22b as an ellipsis, then prophecy is also a sign, but unlike tongues, it </p>
<p>functions as a positive sign.</p>
<p>231</p>
<p> It conrms to believers that the eschatologi-</p>
<p>cal fulllment in which Gentiles will worship with Jews, alluded to by the </p>
<p>unbeliever’s presence and confession in 14:25, has arrived. God is present </p>
<p>in the midst of them (Isa 45:14; Zech 8:23; Dan 2:47; cf. Joel 2:28–32), and </p>
<p>even the unbeliever confesses this to the believers.</p>
<p>232</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With either interpretation above, Paul still seems to qualify 14:22b </p>
<p>by showing in 14:24–25 that prophecy can benet unbelievers, too. If, </p>
<p>228. ὥστε does not signal a question here, pace Johanson 1979:193–94, but focalizes </p>
<p>a preceding argument in a conclusive way, as Long 2013:149–57, shows (though, dier-</p>
<p>ently than Long, I maintain that ὥστε in Paul does function sometimes with preceding </p>
<p>traditional material; e.g., Gal 3:9; 1 Cor 10:12 and 14:22 [see comments ad. loc.]).</p>
<p>229. E.g., Prophecy is meant to benet believers so that its use in church will benet </p>
<p>unbelievers incidentally (Hiu 2010:100). Prophecy is a sign not resulting in unbeliev-</p>
<p>ers but resulting in believers (Gladstone 1999:185–92; Heil 2005:200). Tongues are </p>
<p>(mistakenly) recognized by the ordinary person as pagan mania and so are proper to </p>
<p>unbelievers, but prophecy is a refutation to the public that God speaks to them through </p>
<p>believers (Smit 1994:184–89).</p>
<p>230. Hays 1997:240. Similarly, notice John 6:27; 12:44: “not only”/“not primarily.”</p>
