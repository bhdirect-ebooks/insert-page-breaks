<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>

<p>or at least tongues and the interpretation of tongues, which are placed last </p>
<p>(12:30; cf. v.10). It so happens that Paul considers prophecy to be greater </p>
<p>than tongues (1 Cor 14), and the Corinthians should seek greater gis. e </p>
<p>gis may be ranked on the basis of how they benet others (14:6),</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>and if</p>
<p>so, then the greater gis require greater utilization for edifying others rather </p>
<p>than boasting in one’s spirituality. Perhaps the gis of wisdom, knowledge, </p>
<p>and prophecy are assumed to be operating through the oces of apostle, </p>
<p>teacher, and prophet. ese tidy distinctions, however, tend to overlap since </p>
Paul and other individuals may operate in much more than one gi.
<p>Paul ends the chapter with rhetorical questions posed to reinforce </p>
auditors to recognize the importance of gi diversity and dependency on
<p>those who have them. ey are to reply, “no, not all are apostles, prophets </p>
<p>. . . .or possess gis of healings, or speak in tongues,” and so on. Although </p>
<p>the Spirit distributes gis as the Spirit wills, Paul encourages congregants </p>
<p>to earnestly desire the greater gis. is suggests that fervent prayer, the </p>
action behind earnest desire (14:12–13), might result in a divine willingness
<p>to grant petitioners their requests for new spiritual endowments.</p>
<p>Love as the Superlative Way (13:1–13)</p>
<p>Paul explicates love’s role at the center of his discussion on spiritual gis. It </p>
<p>is a more superlative way than pursuing greater gis (12:31b).</p>
<p>147</p>
<p> He dis-</p>
<p>cusses love (ἀγάπη) more as a “way” than an emotion, which Hays distills </p>
<p>as “a manner of life within which all the ts are to nd their proper place.”</p>
<p>148</p>
<p> </p>
<p>iselton rightly asserts here that love “denotes above all a stance or attitude </p>
<p>which shows itself in acts of will as regard, respect, and concern for the </p>
<p>welfare of the other. It is therefore profoundly christological, for the cross is </p>
<p>the paradigm case of the act of will and stance which places welfare of others </p>
<p>above the interests of the self.”</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>Paul already stressed the importance of</p>
<p>God’s love and loving one’s neighbor (8:1–3), and now he exhibits love using </p>
<p>epideictic rhetoric, more specically an encomium in praise of love (esp. </p>
<p>13:4–7).</p>

<p>147. urén 2001:101 posits that καθʼ ὑπερβολὴν is “by means of hyperbole.” Al-</p>
<p>though there is hyperbole (e.g., 13:2), it does not characterize the entire discourse, and </p>
<p>elsewhere Paul uses καθʼ ὑπερβολὴν in a superlative sense (2 Cor 1:8; Gal 1:13; Rom </p>
<p>7:13).</p>
