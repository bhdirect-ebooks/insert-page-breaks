<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>In 4:6 these things probably refers to the content of what Paul has </p>
<p>written since 3:5. More particularly, it points to the dierent metaphors that </p>
<p>describe Paul and Apollos as day laborers in a eld, builders of a temple, </p>
<p>and assistants and administrative stewards under the Lord’s authority. With </p>
<p>these various occupational roles, Paul says, I have guratively transformed </p>
<p>into myself and Apollos for your sake.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p>e apostle is not literally a</p>
<p>farmer, building contractor, etc., but has in a gurative sense taken on these </p>
<p>positions for the two-fold purpose of teaching his auditors not to go beyond </p>
<p>proper boundaries they have been taught, and not to be arrogant.</p>
<p>If we unpack the latter purpose, no one among the Corinthians are </p>
<p>to be pued up in favor of the one against the other. is attitude by ex-</p>
<p>tension condemns all such dissensions in the congregation, but most im-</p>
<p>mediately the “one” can refers to Paul and the “other” Apollos. is notion </p>
<p>of over-estimation of oneself resurfaces elsewhere in the letter and may be </p>
<p>understood as conceit and arrogance (φυσιόω: 4:18–19; 5:2; 8:1; 13:4; cf. </p>
<p>φυσίωσις: 2 Cor 12:20). Peter Marshall asserts that the word is further ex-</p>
<p>plicated in 4:7–8, which convey thoughts of self-superiority and boasting, </p>
<p>and are further associated with the similar vice of hubris, a type of insolence </p>
<p>that, among other things, characterizes the behavior of those with power </p>
<p>who intend to dishonor others.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p> e sophists are thus described with con-</p>
<p>ceit and thinking themselves better than others (Dio Chrysostom Or. 6.21). </p>
<p>Welborn appropriately adds regarding Corinthian arrogance: </p>
<p>It is all too familiar to the student of political history as the cari-</p>
<p>cature of the political windbag, the orator inated at his success </p>
<p>(Ps.-Plato Alcibiades 2 145e; Plutarch Cicero 887b; Epictetus </p>
<p>Diss. 2.16.10), the young aristocrat, the aspiring tyrant, lled </p>
<p>with a sense of his own power (Alcibiades and Critias in Xeno-</p>
<p>phon Mem. 1.2.25; Gaius in Philo Legat. 86.154; Pau<span class="_ _0" />sanias in </p>
<p>Demosthenes 59.97; see also ucydides 1.132.1–3; Dio Chrys-</p>
<p>ostom 30.19; 58.5), the supercilious oceholder (Demosthenes </p>
<p>19.314; Philo Legat. 69.255).</p>
<p>163</p>
<p> </p>
<p>161. Among the many ways translators have rendered the aorist verb μετεσχημάτισα </p>
<p>(which I render “guratively transformed”) Paul probably uses it in the normal sense </p>
<p>of changing the form of something (cf. Phil 3:20). For a survey of interpretations, see </p>
<p>Mihaila 2009:202–12; Bitner 2015b:290–94. A prominent view is that this is a veiled </p>
<p>argument or “covert allusion” used to censure or correct someone indirectly (Fiore </p>
<p>1985:89, 92–93). But Paul is not indirect in 3:1–5, 9, 16–23, and the rhetorical term </p>
<p>σχηματίζω is not μετασχηματίζω (cf. Mahaila 2009:204).</p>
<p>162. Marshall 1987:204–6; cf. 182–90 (ὕβρις).</p>
