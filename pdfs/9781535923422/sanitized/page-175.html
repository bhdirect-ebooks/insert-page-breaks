<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>

<p>of our own. If several women today came to church wearing see-through </p>
<p>negligees, the usher might cover them with choir robes and advise them to </p>
<p>dress more modestly for church. And as Richard Hays says, men wearing </p>
<p>baseball caps to a formal dinner or church would be perceived as “rude </p>
<p>and irreverent.”</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>These norms, too, might change one day, but as long</p>
<p>as church attendees get distracted or are tempted to gaze on the creature </p>
<p>rather than Creator, issues involving gender sensitivity, propriety, and mod-</p>
<p>esty in appearance will remain important.</p>
<p>Divisions When Commemorating the </p>
<p>Last Supper (11:17–34)</p>
<p>e next issue centers on the congregation commemorating the Lord’s Sup-</p>
<p>per. In contrast to his praise in 11:2, when they come together for this meal </p>
<p>Paul says, I do not praise you. eir celebration turns out to be for the </p>
worse: there are divisions among them related to this meal, which has be-
<p>come disadvantageous for certain members.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>He expresses displeasure with</p>
<p>epideictic blame employing irony, pathos, and four rhetorical questions </p>
<p>building up to a second and louder, “I do not praise you!” (11:18–22). He </p>
<p>then instructs from the Lord’s Supper tradition handed to him (11:23–26). </p>
<p>e various words related to judgment, examination, and discernment in </p>
<p>11:27–32 sound similar in Greek, suggesting the use of paronomasia. He </p>
<p>then concludes with an attempt to resolve the problem (11:33–34).</p>
<p>Paul believes the report of their misconduct in part. ere is no reason </p>
<p>to doubt it, however, and so this is probably said in irony as a type of mock </p>
<p>disbelief based on what follows.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>In keeping with this irony, Paul continues</p>
<p>in 11:19, for of course there must be discriminations among you, so that </p>
<p>those approved among you as dignitaries may be recognized!</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>e “for”</p>
<p>53. Hays 1997:184.</p>
<p>54 e enumerative “in the rst place” (πρῶτον μὲν) is apparently broken o from </p>
<p>a subsequent “Secondly”: Fee 1987:536–37.</p>
<p>55. See Mitchell 1991:152. Alternatively, μέρος τι could mean “a certain matter/</p>
<p>report” (Winter 2001:159–63).</p>
<p>56. e schisms are described as αἱρέσεις, which may be understood as factions, </p>
<p>or perhaps more relevantly, discriminations (Horsley 1998:159; cf. Philo Gig. 18.6; Jo-</p>
<p>sephus Ant. 7.321). Last 2013:365–81, posits the meaning as “elections” of appointed </p>
<p>ocers administrating the meal, a view contested by Brookins 2014:423–32.</p>
