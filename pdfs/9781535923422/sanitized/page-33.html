<p>Occasion and Purpose of the Letter</p>
Paul learns through a report and letter that there are divisions among Co-
<p>rinthian congregation members over their self-identied allegiances with </p>
<p>certain leaders—Paul and Apollos primarily—and the solidarity of members </p>
<p>is being threatened by their assimilation with outsiders through sexual mis-</p>
<p>conduct, idol meats, and other issues.</p>
<p>46</p>
Other divisions and conicts center
<p>on their spiritual activities, worship, the Lord’s Supper, legal disputes, and </p>
<p>disputes over the future resurrection. Paul’s challenge is to respond to the </p>
<p>plurality of these voices.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> A number of factors may contribute to their fac-</p>
<p>tions, not the least of which is that the members are relatively new converts. </p>
<p>Paul started the church only a few years earlier, and his departure le them </p>
<p>without their founding leader, though others like Apollos temporarily stood </p>
<p>in to ll that vacuum (cf. Acts 18:27—19:1). eir misperceptions about wis-</p>
<p>dom, speeches, freedom in Christ, use of spiritual gis, and life aer death </p>
<p>are clearly evident (1 Cor 1:17; 6:12–13; 8:1–2, 8–9; 14:26; 15:12), and p<span class="_ _0" />ublic </p>
<p>speaking, human wisdom, and boasting stand over against the preaching of </p>
<p>the cross, spiritual wisdom, and humility in this letter. is suggests that at </p>
<p>least part of the conict stems from external social and ideological inuences </p>
<p>on the congregation. I posit that members still esteem status symbols associ-</p>
<p>ated with social prestige and wise and eloquent speech.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>e inuences of</p>
<p>sophism and Roman elitism aect the congregation (see esp. 1:17—2:12).</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>Most scholars today hold that 1 Corinthians was originally one let-</p>
<p>ter rather than a compilation of letters.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>Margaret Mitchell’s arrangement</p>
<p>based on deliberative rhetoric convincingly supports the letter’s integrity </p>
<p>and rightly argues that the primary aim of this letter is to address factional </p>
<p>behavior in the congregation and to encourage unity.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>We notice that the</p>
<p>central appeal (παρακαλῶ) for solidarity in 1:10 seems linked with an appeal </p>
<p>for imitation in 4:16, which in turn connects with the charge for imitation in </p>
<p>11:1. Together these link up with other topics and correspondence questions </p>
<p>46. ere is no evidence for itinerate opponents inltrating the congregation at this </p>
<p>time (see Oropeza 2012a:66–71).</p>

<p>49. See Roman inuence on Corinth and further sophist aws in Winter 2001, esp. </p>
<p>xi, 1–28; Winter 2002. I consider the term elitist not in a restricted sense of royalty, </p>
<p>senatorial oces, and the super wealthy, but inclusive of the lower upper class: see </p>
<p>Dutch 2005:45–46.</p>
