<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>

<p>time judge (Rom 14:10; 1 ess 3:13). Perhaps Paul imagines a judgment in </p>
<p>which God works in and through Christ who is the visible representative of </p>
the divine presence on that day (cf. Rom 2:16). Hence, “Lord” in this context
<p>may refer to God in Christ. is apocalyptic scene partially resembles Dan </p>
<p>7:9–15, which depicts both the Ancient of Days in a courtroom as judge and </p>
<p>also the Son of Man.</p>
<p>Paul mentions three things that will take place at this judgment. First, </p>
<p>the Lord will bring to light what is hidden in the darkness. Here, darkness </p>
<p>is not necessarily metaphorical for what is evil or immoral but what is un-</p>
<p>seen and secretive (cf. Ps 139:1–12; Dan 2:22; Matt 10:27). Second, the Lord </p>
<p>will reveal the motives of the hearts. Paul’s assumption is that the Lord </p>
<p>knows all things including human inner thoughts (Prov 15:11; 1 Cor 14:25; </p>
<p>Rom 8:27; Heb 4:12–13).</p>
<p>159</p>
<p>ird, each person will receive praise from</p>
<p>God on that day. Our apostle’s words betray an optimism about that day </p>
<p>probably because he thinks of Apollos and himself foremost as those being </p>
<p>examined. As far as he can determine, he is free of any personal wrongdo-</p>
<p>ing and is condent that faithful servants will be honored by God aer the </p>
<p>examination (4:4a; cf. 3:8, 14; 2 Cor 1:14; Phil 2:16; 1 ess 2:19). Hidden </p>
<p>motives are something the Corinthians cannot know; hence, unless given </p>
divine revelation they cannot properly criticize Paul.
<p>Exhortations, Hardships, </p>
<p>and Parental Instruction (4:6–21)</p>
<p>Paul’s appeal (παρακαλῶ) for the Corinthians to imitate him in 4:16 forms </p>
<p>a subtle inclusio with 1:10 that signals the close of this entire letter section </p>
and rst supporting proof against congregational divisions. A number of
<p>stylistic devices ll this pericope including ellipsis (4:6), rhetorical ques-</p>
<p>tions (4:7), anabasis (the gradual ascent of successive words) (4:8), irony </p>
<p>(4:8a, 10), sarcasm (4:8b), antitheses (4:10, 12–13), hyperbole (4:8, 13b, </p>
<p>15), polysyndeton (multiple conjunctions) (4:9, 11–12a), asyndeton (no </p>
<p>conjunctions) (4:12b–13), and epanalepsis (repetition aer a break: “until </p>
<p>this present hour,” “until now”) (4:11, 13).</p>
<p>160</p>
<p>e text ends with an aphorism</p>
<p>(4:20) and an ultimatum posed as a question (4:21). Paul provokes pathos by </p>
<p>attempting to stir Corinthian emotions through strong exclamations (4:8), </p>
<p>pity (4:9–13), shame (4:14), fear (4:18 –20), familial aection (4:6a, 15, 17), </p>
<p>parental instruction, exhortation, and admonition (4:6b, 14 –17, 21). All this </p>
<p>is aimed at deating their arrogant and discordant attitude (4:6c–7, 18–19).</p>
