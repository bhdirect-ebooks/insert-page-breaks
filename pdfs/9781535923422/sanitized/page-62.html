<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>

<p>Fourth, Paul calls the crucied Christ the Lord of glory. Perhaps he de-</p>
<p>rives this title from prophetic-apocalyptic traditions; “the glory of the Lord” </p>
<p>in Isa 40:5 may be his primary source.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>e Isaianic context is cited more</p>
<p>explicitly in 1 Cor 2:16, and perhaps informs some of Paul’s other thoughts, </p>
too. e Isaianic glory is associated with salvation and divine presence for
<p>both God’s people and the Gentiles (40:5b; 66:18–19), and this presence </p>
<p>guides the restored people through a new exodus and wilderness journey </p>
<p>to Zion as though in a triumphal procession (40:3; cf. 43:2–17; 48:20–21).</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is anticipated era is characterized by God’s Spirit being poured out on </p>
<p>God’s people and making the wilderness fertile ground (32:6–20; 44:3; </p>
<p>59:21; cf. 42:1; 58:4–7; 59:4, 15; 61:1–4). e glory of the Lord also stands </p>
<p>over against the “glory of man” representing what is beautiful and presti-</p>
<p>gious in the eyes of the world. Human glory passes away, but God’s word </p>
<p>abides forever (40:6–8). Paul interprets these prophetic words as fullled </p>
<p>in his day with the crucied and resurrected Christ imparting his glorious </p>
<p>salvation and presence through the Spirit that teaches and guides faithful </p>
<p>people during their travels in the metaphoric new exodus-wilderness to </p>
nal salvation (cf. 1 Cor 10:1–11). Such teaching is God’s “word,” divine
<p>wisdom that confounds transient human prestige. </p>
<p>Fih, this wisdom is spoken in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which </p>
<p>God preordained before the ages. Two implied reasons rulers cannot </p>
<p>grasp this wisdom is because it has been hidden and originated before the </p>
<p>present age to which they belong. Paul might be presupposing wisdom </p>
<p>personied in precreation discourse (Prov 8:22–31; Sir 1:1–10). is idea, </p>
<p>however, seems developed from the disclosure of salvation in Isa 40 again, </p>
<p>and Paul adds from his quote in 2:9 the idea of preordination—God has </p>
<p>prepared beforehand amazing things for those who love God (2:9 cf. Rom </p>
<p>16:25–26). As well, prophetic traditions that anticipated Christ’s crucixion, </p>
<p>especially by the hand of rulers, he probably interprets as predestined by </p>
<p>God (Ps 2; cf. Acts 4:25–28). Namely, God determined ages ago that this </p>
<p>salvation through the Christ event would take place, and God revealed it to </p>
<p>the prophets, though in a hidden manner prior to Christ’s advent. It remains </p>
<p>a hidden mystery to those who do not have God’s Spirit, but God is now </p>
<p>disclosing that plan to Christ’s followers in a progressive way. is wisdom </p>
<p>is for our glory, that is, for the purpose of bringing salvation to those who </p>
<p>love God and follow the Lord (cf. Rom 8:18, 28–30).</p>
<p>80. e “glory of the Lord” is a genitive of source: the glory that nds its origin in </p>
<p>the Lord. e “Lord of glory” is a genitive of (characteristic) quality: “the Lord to whom </p>
<p>glory belongs” (Edwards 1897:54; cf. Eph 1:17; Acts 7:2).</p>
<p>81. Goldingay 2005:18, suggests from Isa 40:3 the idea of “processional routes used </p>
<p>for religious festivals and triumphal royal processions in Babylon.”</p>
