<p>12–14). If Paul was to proclaim his message successfully in this city, perhaps </p>
<p>he prepared himself by learning about some of their religious traditions.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Paul and the Corinthian Church</p>
<p>e Corinth that Paul visits was one lled with sanctuaries, statues, shops, </p>
<p>an agora, and a forum with tribunal that probably inspired his own de-</p>
<p>piction of Christ on the judgment seat (2 Cor 5:10). A number of small </p>
<p>shop keepers, artisans, teachers, and secretaries were among the people of </p>
<p>Corinth whom Appian considers poor (Hist. 8.136).</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>Alciphron speaks of</p>
<p>the area having both immorally rich and miserably poor (Ep. 3.24[iii.60]). </p>
<p>Dio Chrysostom, writing in the rst century CE, describes the rabble at </p>
<p>the Isthmian games: “One could hear crowds of wretched sophists around </p>
<p>Poseidon’s temple shouting and reviling one another, and their disciples . . . </p>
<p>ghting with one another, many writers reading aloud their stupid works, </p>
<p>many poets reciting their poems while others applauded them, many jug-</p>
<p>glers showing their tricks, many fortune-tellers interpreting fortunes, law-</p>
<p>yers innumerable perverting judgment, and peddlers not a few peddling </p>
<p>whatever they happened to have” (Or. 8.9).</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>Paul perhaps witnessed similar</p>
<p>activities. e Corinthian population at this time was perhaps anywhere </p>
<p>from 80,000 to 140,000.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>According to Acts 18 he teams up with Prisca and Aquila, fellow Jewish </p>
<p>tentmakers recently expelled from Rome by Emperor Claudius,</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>and later</p>
<p>on Timothy and Silas assist him there. His proclamation of the gospel turns </p>
<p>out to be successful—“many” Corinthians believe and are baptized (18:8). </p>
<p>e Lord speaks to him in a vision assuring his protection and encouraging </p>
<p>him to preach, for “I have many people in this city,” and so Paul remains </p>
<p>there for eighteen months (18:9–10). We can assume that this church grew </p>
<p>to be fairly large, probably over one hundred converts with their families. </p>
<p>e houses of Titius Justus and Gaius became early gathering places (Acts </p>
<p>18:7; Rom 16:23).</p>
