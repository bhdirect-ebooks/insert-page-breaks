<p>that engenders rivalry and grumbling in the congregation (1:11; 3:3; 10:10). </p>
<p>at it does not take account of wrongs done seems related to their taking </p>
<p>other members to court (see 6:7–8). If so, then it may be implied that the </p>
<p>plainti should show forgiveness, refuse to harbor resentment, and relent </p>
<p>from “getting even.” e notion that love rejoices not in injustice but co-</p>
<p>rejoices with the truth may be relevant especially for deterring those who </p>
<p>do wrong to other members and thus provoke them to battle in court. In-</p>
<p>stead, they should stand for the truth of a matter and not bear false witness. </p>
<p>Many of love’s qualities in this encomium are multifaceted and should </p>
<p>not be limited only to things immediately relevant to the Corinthian situ-</p>
<p>ation. e notion of co-rejoicing, for example, is important for the body </p>
<p>life of any church (12:26), and truth may include one’s perception of God, </p>
<p>Christ, and the gospel (Rom 1:18; 2 Cor 11:10; Gal 2:5).</p>
<p>171</p>
<p>e exercise of</p>
<p>love would seem to be key in resolving many conicts in a church.</p>
<p>Four further descriptors enhance the virtually limitless extent to which </p>
<p>love perseveres and never fails—it bears all things, believes all things, </p>
<p>hopes all things, endures all things. e rst phrase is inclusive of putting </p>
<p>up with the faults of others, not giving in to ungodly ways, and not permit-</p>
<p>ting discouragement to fester on account of aictions and disappointments. </p>
<p>It forms an inclusio with “endures all things” and overlaps in meaning.</p>
<p>172</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>latter, though, stresses love’s nal perseverance and sets the stage for the next </p>
<p>verse that declares, love never falls away (13:8a). e statements between the </p>
<p>inclusio are repeated again as faith and hope in 13:13. Rather than convey-</p>
<p>ing naivety, belief and hope are the means by which endurance is supple-</p>
<p>mented—they persist despite whatever obstacles and hardships might come </p>
<p>their way. ese virtues eventually point to the idea that love is supreme and </p>
<p>remains forever; it “conquers all things” (Virgil, Eclog. 10.86).</p>
<p>Love’s permanent stability is then set in contrast to three spiritual gis, </p>
<p>each of which will eventually fail (13:8–12). is stresses again that love </p>
<p>is greater than any spiritual gi. Prophecy, tongues and knowledge have </p>
<p>temporal value; in the present era they contribute partially to the full knowl-</p>
<p>edge that will be revealed when what is complete has come. is comple-</p>
<p>tion or perfection (τέλειος) does not refer to the close of New Testament </p>
<p>canonical revelation (a view that is anachronistic since Paul, and especially </p>
<p>the Corinthians, would not even understand what this means).</p>

<p>Nor does</p>
<p>171. Cf. Wischmeyer 1981:102–3.</p>
<p>172. See Ciampa/Rosner 2010:649–50, in which the former is “never give in” (to </p>
<p>worldly pressure) and the latter is “never give up.”</p>
<p>173. Wallace 1996:422, distinguishes between tongues that die out (παύω in middle </p>
<p>voice) and prophecy/knowledge that will be done away (καταργέω in passive voice) to </p>
<p>suggest that tongues may have died out before the time when the “perfect” comes. But </p>
