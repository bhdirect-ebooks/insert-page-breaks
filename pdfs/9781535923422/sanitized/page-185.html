<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>161</p>
<p>body of Christ (see 12:13; cf. Rom 8:9). Paul’s response that no one can say </p>
<p>Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit assumes that conversion is at stake. </p>
<p>e confession is public, declaring before other witnesses one’s absolute </p>
<p>allegiance is to Jesus’s lordship—it sets oneself apart from non-Christian </p>
<p>Jews, for whom these words would sound blasphemous, and non-Christian </p>
<p>Gentiles, who might nd the claim subversive to Caesar.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>In such milieu</p>
<p>this confession has far more meaning than a charlatan would dare parrot in </p>
<p>deception! </p>
<p>Paul’s words have at least three corollary implications. First, once </p>
<p>God’s Spirit dwells in and with the confessor of Jesus as Lord, the Spirit will </p>
<p>apportion spiritual gis to each believer as the Spirit sees t (12:11, 13). </p>
<p>Second, there seems to be no waiting period or subsequent outpouring of </p>
<p>God’s Spirit that must take place before a believer could operate in spiritual </p>
<p>gis. Every baptized believer is spiritual.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>ird, since not every utterance</p>
<p>or spiritual phenomenon comes from God’s Spirit, there is need for discern-</p>
<p>ment among congregation members regarding their use of speaking gis </p>
<p>(cf. 14:26–29). Discernment is all the more necessary if a person who is rela-</p>
<p>tively a new believer makes spiritual utterances. Such manifestations must </p>
<p>not be fabricated, manipulated, or expected to come by a self-induced emo-</p>
<p>tional state. Likewise, there is no compelling reason to assume the Spirit’s </p>
<p>manifestation and gis center on the notion of “ecstatic” phenomena, or a </p>
<p>state of trance caused by spirit-possession, or Christian “spiritism” in which </p>
<p>believers become mediums of a plurality of good spirits.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>e phenomena</p>
<p>Paul promotes comes from the one and same Spirit (12:4, 11), who, to be </p>
<p>sure, could overwhelm believers with a vision or extreme joy, but does not </p>
<p>necessarily or even characteristically do so as they operate in prophecy, </p>
<p>tongues, and other spiritual gis. e person is still in control of his or her </p>
<p>own faculties (14:32–33).</p>
<p>In 12:4–11 several points are noteworthy. First, the same Spirit . . . </p>
<p>Lord . . . and . . . God who empowers all are involved in the various ap-</p>
<p>portionments, ministries, and activities of believers. is proto-Trinitarian </p>
language of Paul grounds diversity in unity as the appropriate model for
<p>all Corinthian members to emulate regarding their service and gis. e </p>
Spirit is viewed as a divine personal entity here, sovereignly bestowing gis
<p>110. Similarly, Fee 1987:581–82.</p>
<p>111. Cf. Eriksson 1998:217.</p>
<p>112. Pace respectively, Conzelmann 1975:204; Mount 2005:317–18, 327; Tibbs </p>
<p>2006:69–72, 271–72, 279. Tibbs’s “a holy spirit” (12:3) is unlikely given the Spirit’s </p>
<p>uniqueness in 12:4, 11 and the article τό used with πνεῦμα in e.g., 2 Cor 1:22; 13:13[14]; </p>
<p>Gal 5:22; Rom 8:27; etc. </p>
