<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>143</p>
<p>eort of honoring other members who are not the head (12:21–24).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> With-</p>
<p>out this understanding of leadership, we risk falling into a deplorable legacy </p>
<p>of Christians who misinterpret Paul as if he were enslaving the female body </p>
<p>for the express service of the male head!</p>
<p>Whatever else the man as the woman’s head might mean, it does not </p>
<p>follow that this relationship correlates exactly to the way Christ is the head </p>
<p>of the man or God is the head of Christ. Christ’s headship probably implies </p>
<p>his preexistence and lordship as creator of all things (8:4–6). e headship </p>
<p>list starts with the man’s head as Christ, then the woman’s head as the man, </p>
<p>and then again Christ is mentioned, whose head is God. e second men-</p>
<p>tion of Christ in this link perhaps envisions him as the second Adam who </p>
<p>now ushers in the new creation (15:21–22, 45–49). God is mentioned last </p>
<p>rather than rst in this list so as to stress God not as the creating head of all </p>
<p>things but the goal of all headship.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>is anticipates the eschatological reign</p>
<p>of God as the head with Christ as the vizier over the cosmos when Christ </p>
<p>returns and death is defeated (15:21–28; cf. 8:6). is fully realized end, in-</p>
<p>cidentally, will do away with the gender problems Paul and the Corinthians </p>
<p>currently face.</p>
<p>e issue at hand centers on the outward gender appearance in wor-</p>
<p>ship gatherings. Every man who prays or prophesies having something </p>
<p>on his head dishonors his head. A head covering is that “something.”</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> Al-</p>
<p>though we cannot know the situation for sure, a plausible one for the male </p>
<p>covering was the toga, which is normally draped over the head of pious </p>
<p>and priestly Romans.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>e importance of such coverings are entrenched</p>
<p>in perhaps the most important Roman myth. Helenus the prophet charges </p>
<p>seamen destined to be Romans regarding paying vows and devotion to the </p>
<p>gods—they are to veil their hair with a purple robe: “is mode of sacrice </p>
<p>do thou keep, thou and thy company; by this observance let thy children&apos;s </p>
<p>children in purity stand fast” (Virgil, Aen. 3.403–9).</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Faithful citizens thus</p>
<p>wore head coverings as a sign of religious piety, and Roman Corinthians </p>
<p>were constantly reminded of this whenever seeing the statues of emperors </p>
<p>10. See Lee-Barnewall 2013:605–14.</p>
<p>11. is does not deny God as creator (11:12c) but it does highlight that God cre-</p>
<p>ated all things through Christ.</p>
<p>12. E.g., Petrovich 2015:113–16. On “(having) on/down the head” (κατὰ κεφαλῆς </p>
<p>[ἔχων]) compare Dionysius Halicarnassus 3.71.5; 12.16.3–4[23]; Plutarch Quaest. rom. </p>
<p>[Mor.]267C; Edsall 2013:135; Massey 2007:502–23.</p>
<p>13. See in Ferguson 2014:231–32; Oster 1992:68; Gill 1990:246; ompson </p>
<p>1988:101–4. On Jewish male cultic coverings, see Blattenberger 1997:44.</p>
<p>14. Finney 2010:37–38. Such coverings represent self-abasement, concealment, and </p>
<p>deference (40).</p>
