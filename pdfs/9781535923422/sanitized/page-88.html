<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>

<p>be referring to with this rod? Richard Hays relates this to the showdown </p>
<p>between Elijah and the prophets of Baal (1 Kgs 18:20–40), and Roy Har-</p>
<p>risville, with Moses and Pharaoh’s magicians (Exod 7–9).</p>
<p>216</p>
<p>Perhaps a more</p>
<p>relevant parallel describes Paul being lled with the Spirit’s power and </p>
<p>temporarily blinding a false prophet who attempts to obstruct his minis-</p>
<p>try (Acts 13:6–11). Similar discipline might be enforced when Paul warns </p>
<p>the Corinthians that he will not “spare” them in an upcoming visit (2 Cor </p>
<p>13:1–2). is power represents the apostle’s God-given and eectual author-</p>
<p>ity to impose a discipline appropriate to the oense, such as when he expels </p>
<p>the fornicator in the next chapter.</p>
