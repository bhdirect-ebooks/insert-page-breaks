<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>apostles are depicted having an administrative position in God’s domain </p>
<p>as delegated servants doing the bidding of their Lord, Jesus Christ. e </p>
<p>second term, administrative steward (οἰκονόμος), portrays a similar image </p>
<p>in which the apostles are commercial managers.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>John Goodrich’s study</p>
<p>of this position distinguishes between dierent types of administrators and </p>
<p>concludes that Paul resembles most the private administrator. ese “were </p>
<p>almost always slaves during the Roman period, normally serving a κύριος/</p>
<p>dominus [lord] as business managers.”</p>
<p>155</p>
<p>Paul and Apollos are portrayed</p>
<p>metaphorically as God’s competent servant-treasurers entrusted with the </p>
<p>mysteries of God (the wealth of God’s wisdom related to the plan of salva-</p>
<p>tion). is position would be known and relevant for congregation mem-</p>
<p>bers who knew Erastus, a fellow church member who served as οἰκονόμος </p>
<p>for their city (Rom 16:23). ough unlike Paul’s nuance, Erastus seems to be </p>
<p>a civic rather than private administrator and probably not a slave. As a fel-</p>
<p>low believer and Paul’s colleague, Erastus appears to have the time, money, </p>
<p>and freedom to do missionary travelling, which would hardly be possible </p>
<p>for slaves (cf. Acts 19:22; 2 Tim 4:20).</p>
<p>156</p>
<p>As God’s administrative steward, Paul must be found faithful, a virtue </p>
<p>that has implications for the Corinthians who must learn that faithfulness </p>
<p>rather than clever words is the proper criteria for evaluation.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p>Since Paul</p>
<p>considers them incompetent as spiritual judges (cf. 2:11–15), he thinks it </p>
<p>a very small matter that his ministerial and speaking performance should </p>
<p>be evaluated and criticized by them in comparison with other leaders like </p>
<p>Apollos. He mentions three incompetent tribunals—the Corinthians, the </p>
<p>human court system, and Paul’s self-awareness: I do not even judge myself. </p>
<p>Although he is not conscious of doing anything wrong, he is not acquitted </p>
<p>on that basis, for there is one to whom Paul is accountable and that person </p>
<p>can reveal things Paul may have neglected and forgotten about, whether </p>
<p>good or bad. He implies here that if he cannot fully determine his own inno-</p>
<p>cence and secret motives, how much less the Corinthians? e only compe-</p>
<p>tent judge is the Lord who will preside on judgment day. is takes place at </p>
<p>the second coming of Christ and day of the Lord (cf. 3:13), which stands in </p>
<p>contrast to any human day in which a human court is appointed to decide </p>
<p>a case.</p>
<p>158</p>
<p> Both Christ (2 Cor 5:10) and God seem to be active as the end-</p>
<p>154. Cf. Goodrich 2012:106–7.</p>
<p>155. Ibid. 200; cf. 25–116.</p>

<p>158. In 4:3 ἀνθρώπινος ἡμέρα is oen translated as “human court” (NRSV), but it </p>
<p>literally means “human day.”</p>
