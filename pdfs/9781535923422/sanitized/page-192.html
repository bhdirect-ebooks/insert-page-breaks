<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>168</p>
<p>those who suer (12:26). e latter especially embarks on what it is to be a </p>
<p>caring community that empathizes with others (cf. 2 Cor 1:3–7). To be one </p>
<p>body is to stand in unity with every body part. </p>
<p>is chapter closes with Paul listing church positions of apostles rst, </p>
<p>prophets second, and teachers third, and then those who operate in various </p>
<p>spiritual gis (12:28–31a). e three oces are appointed by God, and per-</p>
<p>haps this ranking reects the way earliest churches were originally founded. </p>
<p>Jesus’s disciples rst established his church as apostles (Acts 1–2), and later </p>
<p>on the oces of prophets and teachers were called to continue nurturing </p>
<p>churches that had been established (Acts 13:1–3). Even so, one could hardly </p>
<p>deny that such positions identify church leaders. ey head this list not so </p>
<p>that people in this position could “rule” over other members, but that they </p>
<p>could serve others, similar to Christ’s teaching that the disciple who is rst </p>
<p>must become the servant of all (Mark 9:33–35). e apostles are witnesses </p>
<p>of Christ’s resurrection and sent-out as missionaries proclaiming the gospel </p>
<p>and establishing churches (1 Cor 9:1–2). Prophets, as iselton identies, </p>
<p>“perform speech-acts of announcement, proclamation, judgment, challenge, </p>
<p>comfort, support, or encouragement.”</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>In certain verses the prophet seems</p>
<p>to be indistinguishable from anyone with the gi of prophecy (14:29–31). </p>
<p>e former, however, also appears to have some sort of leadership position </p>
<p>or authoritative role in the church, similar to Agabus and the prophets in </p>
<p>Antioch (Acts 11:27–28; 13:1–2; 21:10–12).</p>
<p>143</p>
<p> Teachers “perform speech-</p>
<p>acts of transmission, communicative explanation, interpretation of texts, </p>
<p>establishment of creeds, exposition of meaning and implication, and, more </p>
<p>cognitive, less temporally applied communicative acts.”</p>
<p>144</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Two gis are mentioned for the rst time in 12:28 including helps and </p>
<p>administrations. “Helps” seems to be for those endowed with the ability </p>
<p>to serve well in various capacities in the congregation, oen doing menial </p>
<p>but absolutely necessary tasks behind the scenes that rarely get recognized, </p>
<p>such as cleaning and running errands. “Administrations” conveys the idea </p>
<p>of steering a ship, directing, or governing, and here perhaps it reects the </p>
<p>gi of guiding and counseling others (cf. Rom 12:8). Together, these gis </p>
<p>perhaps involve doing the functions of deacons and overseers, respectively.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To what extent these two may be considered Spirit-given or supernatural is </p>
<p>not mentioned. e gis on this list appear to be in order of prominence, </p>
<p>142. iselton 2000:1017. </p>
<p>143. See further distinctions in Forbes 1997:246.</p>
<p>144. iselton 2000:1017. iselton’s mention of creeds seems anachronistic unless </p>
<p>understood simply as the earliest basic statements and traditions of emergent Christian </p>
<p>beliefs.</p>
