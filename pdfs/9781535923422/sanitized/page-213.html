<p>ask their own husbands at home.</p>
<p>254</p>
<p>is implies that the wives were asking</p>
<p>questions at church, apparently disrupting the inspired speaker’s message by </p>
<p>uninspired inquiries. Certain scholars suggest this activity involved “siing” </p>
<p>the prophet’s words and cross-examining them with questions regarding </p>
<p>their lifestyle or beliefs in public, and this would be especially controversial </p>
<p>if wives were probing their prophetic husbands this way.</p>
<p>255</p>
<p>At least some</p>
<p>questioning of prophecy, however, doubtless included the gi of discern-</p>
<p>ment (14:29; cf. 12:10), and one is hard pressed to arm either that only </p>
<p>men could use this gi publicly or that a wife’s evaluation could never pass </p>
<p>for such discernment. Another problem is that Paul’s recommendation for </p>
<p>wives to learn from their husbands privately has little to do with evaluating </p>
<p>and challenging the speaker.</p>
<p>256</p>
<p>Her questions must have been understood as</p>
<p>uninspired. Perhaps some of them interrupted the speaker, not to challenge </p>
<p>him or her but to ask for clarication of what was being uttered. Moreover, </p>
<p>they may have been asking questions to their husbands about what another </p>
<p>speaker was presently saying. ey may have been asking husbands or other </p>
<p>wives nearby such things as, “What do you think he means? Could he be </p>
<p>saying that . . . ” “Is she referring specically to me? What she’s saying actu-</p>
<p>ally happened to me this week when I . . . ” which presumably sparked brief </p>
<p>chatting instead of listening.</p>
<p>257</p>
<p>e confusion perhaps originated because</p>
<p>many gatherings met in homes.</p>
<p>258</p>
<p>Whereas chatting and asking questions</p>
<p>might be acceptable in the privacy of one’s own home, it was not to be done </p>
<p>in homes and other facilities used for public sacred gatherings. Paul is for-</p>
<p>bidding wives from uninspired talking when others are inspired to speak.</p>
<p>Barrett dismisses λαλέω as meaning uninspired speech and “chatter” </p>
<p>by claiming that “in the New Testament and in Paul, the verb normally does </p>
<p>not have this meaning, and is used throughout chapter xiv . . . in the sense </p>
<p>of inspired speech.”</p>
<p>259</p>
<p> But there are signicant weaknesses with this argu-</p>
<p>ment. First, whereas other instances of λαλέω in this chapter are qualied </p>
<p>as tongues, prophecy, or inspired speaking, we should not automatically </p>
<p>subject this meaning to 14:34, especially when 14:35a seems to clarify that </p>
<p>254. at wives could learn intellectual things may be progressive for that time: see </p>

<p>257. is problem would be compounded if house-churches were set up with men </p>
<p>and women partitioned, similar to the Jewish eraputae sect (Philo, Contempl. III.32–</p>
<p>33; Simon 1967:124–25); then wives would almost need to shout at their husbands to </p>
<p>get their attention.</p>
