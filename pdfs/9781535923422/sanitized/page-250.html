<p>Closing Matters (1 Cor 16:1–24)</p>
<p>226</p>
<p>rose again on that day (Luke 24:1; cf. Acts 20:7; Rev 1:10; Did. 14.1).</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>Corinthian church consists of both poor and non-poor members (11:22), </p>
<p>though like the Macedonian churches, even poor members might be stirred </p>
<p>to give (cf. 2 Cor 8:1–5). Although no standard amount is required or </p>
<p>recommended, Paul anticipates each person giving something rather than </p>
<p>nothing, and they are to give from their prosperity rather than sacricially; </p>
<p>they are not expected to starve so that others might eat.</p>
<p>Paul mentions again his second visit to Corinth (16:2b–9; cf. 4:17–20).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He will remain in Ephesus, from where he writes this letter, until Pentecost, </p>
<p>which is in spring (16:8).</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>en he will travel through Macedonia visiting</p>
<p>other congregations. Aer a few months he plans to visit Corinth and might </p>
<p>spend the winter there. Members could then assist him for his travel to </p>
<p>Jerusalem and handling of the collection (cf. 2 Cor 1:16; Rom 15:25).</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>some of their own members are approved by them for the task, he will write </p>
<p>letters of recommendation for them to the Jerusalem church and any others </p>
<p>they might visit. Paul submits his plans to the Lord (16:4, 7), who through </p>
<p>circumstances and the Spirit’s guidance ultimately determines whether </p>
<p>Paul’s plans will be carried out (cf. 4:19).</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> Meanwhile, he says he will re-</p>
<p>main in Ephesus . . . for a wide and eective door has opened for me, and </p>
<p>there are many adversaries. is opportunity to proclaim the gospel brings </p>
<p>about opposition from the locals (see 15:32). </p>
<p>Another visiting announcement concerns Timothy (16:10–11). </p>
<p>Whenever Timothy arrives in Corinth, the church is to see to it that he </p>
<p>may be with you without fear. Timothy’s arrival whenever (ἐάν) seems </p>
<p>less certain than in 4:17.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> Apparently, as Paul and his writing team com-</p>
<p>posed the letter, it was decided that Timothy should rst visit some of the </p>
<p>neighboring churches going through Macedonia before arriving in Corinth. </p>
<p>Paul expresses less certainty about the timing of Timothy’s arrival given this </p>
<p>11. On resurrection Sunday as the rst day of the new creation, see Oropeza </p>
<p>2016:356.</p>
<p>12. He previously stayed there one and a half years according to Acts 18:11</p>
<p>13. e Corinthians (mostly Gentiles) knew of this Jewish festival (Lev 23:15; Tob </p>
<p>2:1), presumably because they were taught an apostolic tradition related to it (e.g., Acts </p>
<p>2).</p>
<p>14. Although Paul refuses pay for preaching (1 Cor 9), he is not opposed to every </p>
<p>form of assistance from the Corinthians. He doubtless will lodge there with friends and </p>
<p>accept travelling assistance. </p>
<p>15. It will turn out that God had other plans for Paul, a change that upsets the Cor-</p>
<p>inthians (2 Cor 1:12—2:13; 7:4–16; Oropeza 2016:2–18).</p>
<p>16. e aorist tense “I sent” (ἔπεμψα) in 4:17 suggests either that Timothy already </p>
<p>le or, if an epistolary aorist is assumed, he would be leaving with this letter (but now </p>
<p>Stephanas’s group will be carrying the letter).</p>
