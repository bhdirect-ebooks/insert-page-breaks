<p>Prothesis and Statement of Facts (1:10–17)</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Even the very message of the gospel Paul must qualify so that it, too, </p>
does not become a pawn of these divisions through preferences over which
<p>minister proclaims it. e gospel he preaches is not with clever wisdom </p>
<p>of speech, lest the cross of Christ be rendered ineectual.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>e “wisdom</p>
<p>of speech” expressed in 1:17, when compared with 2:1–5 that also gener-</p>
<p>ally combines σοφία (“wisdom”) with λόγος (“speech”), provides us with </p>
<p>a strong clue that Paul is referring primarily to speeches associated with </p>
<p>sophist rhetoricians. ough at times wisdom distinguishes philosophers </p>
<p>from sophists (Plato, Gorgias; Plutarch, De laude 12 [543E–F]), it was also </p>
<p>understood in relation to those possessing practical expertise, cleverness, </p>
<p>and rhetorical skill.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> Wisdom found special relevance in the rhetorical tra-</p>
<p>ditions of Greeks and Romans.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>Eloquence and wisdom were in fact closely</p>
<p>aligned as the rhetorical handbooks conrm; the former, for example, Ci-</p>
<p>cero perceives as “nothing else but wisdom delivering copious utterance” </p>
<p>(Part. or. 23.XXIII.79).</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>Paul speaks against a type of rhetoric similar to the</p>
<p>sophists, which the Corinthians seem to hold in high esteem. Such speaking </p>
<p>for Paul should never become the ground for disrupting fellowship, and it </p>
<p>must not be permitted to eclipse the message of the cross that saves, trans-</p>
<p>forms, and empowers lives.</p>
<p>35. In 1 Cor 1–3 the nuance of σοφία (“wisdom”) varies depending on verse: cf. </p>
<p>Mihaila 2009:92–93; Barrett 1968:67–68. Here the shade of cleverness/eloquence is </p>
<p>apparent; at times philosophy may be more evident as Keener 2016:176, suggests. See </p>
<p>options in Kammler 2003:28.</p>
<p>36. Cf. Pogolo 1992:111–12; Litn 1994:192; Vos 1996:93–94.</p>
