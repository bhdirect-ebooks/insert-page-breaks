<p>spaces, but Paul’s reason for it being glorious is that long hair is given to </p>
<p>her as a covering. at is, her long hair is as a garment that covers her head </p>
<p>and is provided by nature. Her hair nonetheless does not replace her veil in </p>
<p>public spaces (see 11:5–6); rather, it “is analogous to the additional covering </p>
<p>represented by the veil.”</p>

<p>As P. T. Massey arms, the woman’s hair is still to</p>
<p>be covered, and “veiling is a reection or extension of long hair. . . . e veil </p>
<p>thus follows the contour of a woman&apos;s long hair and accentuates the glory </p>
<p>(δόξα) of her natural beauty without creating the social stigma of either </p>
<p>immodesty or ostentatiousness.”</p>

<p>e closing remark, but if anyone who wants to be contentious, an-</p>
<p>ticipates congregation members who might object to Paul’s instruction here. </p>
<p>He responds that the Corinthians stand alone in their novel practice of wor-</p>
<p>ship with men’s heads covered and women’s heads uncovered—none of the </p>
<p>churches of God have such a custom.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>e implication is that they should</p>
<p>be in solidarity with other churches and willing to change their practices.</p>

<p>Although the topic of head coverings seems relegated to the socio-cultural </p>
<p>mores or “custom” of a given society,</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> its promotion of gender differentia-</p>
<p>tion remains entirely relevant for the interim between the old creation and </p>
<p>fully realized new one. Namely, we can still appreciate today that gender </p>
<p>distinction is a good gift from God and should not be defaced regardless of </p>
<p>what one’s culture might think. This does not mean that women in postmod-</p>
<p>ern western societies must still wear headgear; males at these churches do </p>
<p>not normally drool over uncovered female hair. Rather, modesty in dress and </p>
<p>propriety in worship are timeless values that should always be honored, and </p>
<p>that may look different depending on the church and its respective socio-</p>
<p>cultural milieu. Paul’s cultural taboos can be posed analogously to some </p>
<p>49. Watson 2000b:87. Here the preposition ἀντί means “as” (a “corresponding </p>
<p>counterpart”: Massey 2011:53), and περιβόλαίον (Exod 22:26; Deut 22:12; Dionysius </p>
<p>Halicarnassus, 3.71.5), probably refers to a textile covering known as the himation or </p>
<p>palla (Massey 2007:522; Edsall, 2013:139), rather than a wraparound hairstyle (Mur-</p>
<p>phy-O’Connor 1983:179–81; see response in Edsall 2013:136–38) or testicles (Martin </p>
<p>2004:83; see response in Goodacre 2011:391–96. Martin 2013:453–65, rejoins but with </p>
<p>few sources and their meaning for our text remains quite questionable).</p>
