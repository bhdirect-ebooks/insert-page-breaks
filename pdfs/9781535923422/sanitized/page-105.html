<p>Fusing the Horizons: Christians, Homoeroticism, and Loving Your Neighbor</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>that Paul might encourage believers whose orientation remained a perpetual </p>
<p>struggle to stay single and celibate like himself. As a new creation believer, </p>
<p>the ways of the old creation are passing away, and as such, he suggests that </p>
<p>celibacy is better than marriage (see 1 Cor 7). A life of celibacy is, in fact, </p>
<p>how certain Christians today with same-sex attraction claim to honor God </p>
<p>and remain faithful to Christian morals and Scripture.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>It must also be stressed that same-sex eroticism is just one of many </p>
<p>vices on Paul’s list. Regarding a church’s internal affairs, then, the church-</p>
<p>goer with this struggle should not be stigmatized as somehow “worse” than </p>
<p>a churchgoer who struggles with greed, or fornication, or drinks too much, </p>
<p>and so on. Virtually everyone in the church has a story of brokenness, </p>
<p>imperfection, and sin. We are all works in progress. Regarding a church’s </p>
<p>external affairs, Paul expects believers to do good to outsiders (10:31–33; </p>
<p>Gal 6 :10). Unfortunately in recent years, some who claim to be Christian </p>
<p>and hold up signs that express God’s alleged hatred toward certain groups </p>
<p>have received excessive media coverage. This gives the false impression </p>
<p>that these angry extremists represent what the typical Christian believes </p>
<p>or ought to believe. On the contrary, love your neighbor as yourself is what </p>
<p>Paul holds to be central to Christian values (8:1; 14:1; 16:14; Gal 5:14; </p>
<p>Rom 13:8 –10), and one’s neighbor includes people from the LGBT com-</p>
<p>munity. Nevertheless, and contrary to what media, politics, and the world </p>
<p>might say, to show love to another person does not mean that we must </p>
<p>endorse or agree with that person’s beliefs and lifestyle. (Indeed, some-</p>
<p>thing is terribly wrong when the church conforms to the world’s standards!) </p>
<p>Instead, love means that a Christian should accept and value as a fellow </p>
<p>human being who is worthy of open dialogue, respect, care, and friendship </p>
<p>the person he or she disagrees with, and will treat that person the same way </p>
<p>the Christian would want to be treated. Such love is reminiscent of Jesus </p>
<p>who dined, taught, and conversed with those whose status and lifestyles </p>
<p>were despised by others. We also can surmise that Paul must have known, </p>
<p>conversed with, and shown God’s love to same-sex people in Corinth so </p>
<p>that some of them accepted his message and were transformed through the </p>
<p>power of Christ and the Spirit (6:11). </p>
