<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>

<p>must welcome or receive one another, especially those who have less to eat, </p>
<p>when coming together.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>If poorer members have little to eat, hospitality</p>
<p>means that other members should be willing to share with them their own </p>
<p>food. And if those who “have” are in the habit of getting hungry before </p>
<p>the sacred meal, they should eat privately at home rst rather than selshly </p>
<p>horde up all their food in front of the poor. is way they might be more </p>
<p>willing to share the food they bring. Other issues related to this situation </p>
<p>Paul does not address but says I will give directions when I come again to </p>
<p>Corinth (cf. 4:18–19; 16:3–4). Perhaps he wished to implement some rules </p>
<p>for the poor in Corinth, or maybe some private conversations were in order, </p>
<p>especially for the host of these meals.</p>

<p>Gifts of the Spirit and Solidarity in the Body of Christ </p>
<p>(12:1–31)</p>
<p>Paul continues on the subject of proper worship when coming together. He </p>
<p>addresses spiritual gis and encourages the maintenance of order and soli-</p>
<p>darity for the benet of all members (12:1–7). Nine gis appear in 12:8–10, </p>
<p>and then eight are ranked in 12:28. Five questions are posed regarding body </p>
<p>members (12:14, 15, 17, 19), and talking body parts add some humor while </p>
discouraging divisions (12:15–16, 21). Seven more rhetorical questions are
<p>then posed (12:29–30). e passage includes repetitive wording (anaphora) </p>
<p>(12:4–10, 13) and asyndeton with the successive omission of “and” (12:27–</p>
<p>30).</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>ese features help foster Corinthian members to regard themselves</p>
<p>as distinct but complementary parts of the collective body of Christ via </p>
<p>God’s Spirit (12:7, 25a–26). Paul’s discussion may be outlined as a chiasm:</p>
<p>A. Variety of spiritual gis apportioned (12:4–10)</p>
<p>B. Solidarity of members as one body in the Spirit (12:11–14)</p>
<p>C. Questions denying the unsuitability of certain body parts </p>
<p>(12:15–16)</p>
<p>94. Cf. ἐκδέχεσθε (“receive”) in 3 Macc 5:26; Josephus Ant. 7.351; Hous 1993:89–</p>
91; Winter 2001:144–54. Paul similarly discourages divisions among the Romans by
<p>charging them to make weak believers feel welcome when eating together (Rom 14:1; </p>
<p>15:7: though here προσλαμβάνω), and there also he establishes Christ as their example </p>
<p>for solidarity and unselshness (15:1–6). e alternative meaning is “wait” for one an-</p>
<p>other before eating (eissen 1982:151–53; Lampe 1994:37). See 11:21.</p>
<p>95. Walters 2010:363–64, posits that Paul’s words undermine the host’s authority. </p>
<p>Perhaps so (see also Smit 2013:188), but pace Walters (353–54), neither Apollos nor </p>
<p>alleged opponents appear to be the problem (see 1:12 above).</p>
