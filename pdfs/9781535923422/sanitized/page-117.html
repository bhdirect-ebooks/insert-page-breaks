<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>93</p>
<p>Advice on Divorce and Being Married to </p>
<p>an Unbeliever (7:10–16)</p>
Regarding divorce, Paul’s words become more a command than advice by
<p>appealing to an oral tradition from Jesus in which not I but the Lord orders </p>
<p>these things. A saying of Jesus recorded later on in the Gospels claims that if </p>
a person divorces and remarries, he or she commits adultery (Mark 10:2–12;
<p>Matt 5:31–32; 19:3–12; Luke 16:18). Given the complexity of marital rela-</p>
<p>tionships, Paul recognizes that the charge, let not wife be separated from </p>
<p>husband,</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>must be quickly followed up with the qualication that if she</p>
<p>does happen to get separated, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled </p>
to her husband. Likewise, the husband must not divorce his wife.
<p>135</p>
<p>Paul</p>
<p>apparently adds the point about reconciliation; with Jesus he discourages </p>
both divorce and remarriage to another. In Matt 19:9 remarriage is per-
<p>mitted if one’s spouse were sexually unfaithful, but Paul does not mention </p>
<p>this. Perhaps he was unaware of this exception,</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>or if he did know it, he</p>
<p>omits it perhaps because it would have been counter-productive to disclose </p>
it to members bent on divorcing their spouses. Some husbands were in fact
<p>sexually unfaithful; they were having sex with prostitutes! He only arms in </p>
<p>7:10–11 that in emergent Christian marriages the initiator of the marriage’s </p>
<p>breakup does not have the option of getting remarried. </p>
<p>When Paul addresses the rest of the congregation members, he targets </p>
<p>those who are married to unbelieving spouses (7:12–16). Although he does </p>
<p>not approve of single believers marrying unbelievers (cf. 7:39),</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>in the</p>
<p>Corinthian situation some of the spouses of those who converted to Christ </p>
<p>remained unbelievers. And unlike the ethos of Paul’s patriarchal world, the </p>
<p>believing husbands did not force their unbelieving wives to convert. ey </p>
<p>apparently held that each spouse, whether man or woman, must willingly </p>
<p>believe. What then should be done about a marriage in which one’s spouse </p>
<p>refuses to accept Christ?</p>
<p>134. e passive aorist innitive χωρισθῆναι (“to be separated”) may reect Jewish </p>
audiences in which women found it dicult to initiate divorce (Josephus Ant. 15.259;
<p>m. Yebamot 14.1; Fitzmyer 2008:289–90), unlike Romanized women (7:13, 15). Con-</p>
<p>trast synoptic parallels with Mark 10:12; further, Neirynck 1996:166–76.</p>
135. e distinction between “I separate/leave” (χωρίζω) and “I divorce” (ἀφίημι)
<p>should not be understood in the modern sense. See 7:15 below.</p>
<p>136. E.g., the exception clause might originate with Matthew’s community (c. 80 </p>
<p>CE) rather than Jesus (c. 30 CE).</p>
<p>137. Similarly, Israelites are not to marry foreigners, oen with assumption that </p>
<p>foreigners worship idols (Ezra 9:1–2; Tob 4:12–13; T.Lev. 9.10; Jos Asen. 8.5 –7; T.Sol. </p>
<p>26; cf. P.Mur. 19).</p>
