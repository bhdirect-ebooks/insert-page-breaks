<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>

<p>for Paul the “‘life-force’: that is, the sense of aliveness, operating through </p>
<p>breath and blood, energy and purpose, which is common to humankind.”</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e point is one of animation rather than composition. As the ψυχικός body </p>
<p>does not designate a body consisting of “soul-substance,” so the πνευματικός </p>
<p>body does not designate a body formed out of “Spirit-stu.”</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>Rather, as</p>
<p>Wright arms, πνευματικός “describes, not what something is composed </p>
<p>of, but what it is animated by. It is the dierence between speaking of a </p>
<p>ship made of steel or wood on the one hand and a ship driven by steam or </p>
<p>wind on the other.”</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>e πνευματικός body characterizes those who are in</p>
<p>Christ; their existence via the Spirit overcomes the state of death character-</p>
<p>izing the rst Adam and creation, and they participate with the last Adam </p>
<p>(Christ) in the new creation. In the resurrection, they experience the full-</p>
<p>ment of the nal deposit of the Spirit (2 Cor 1:22; 5:5; cf. Rom 8:23).</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>As</p>
<p>such, they become fully empowered by the Spirit to the extent which God </p>
<p>had ultimately intended. It may be said that in the resurrection, the soul as </p>
<p>the principle that animates the body is replaced by the Spirit.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>Rather than</p>
<p>philosophies of the spiritual or immaterial self escaping from the body at </p>
<p>death, Paul promotes the body undergoing a qualitative transformation at </p>
<p>the resurrection with the self intact.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>In 15:45 Paul claims, so also it is written: “e rst man Adam be-</p>
<p>came a living being”; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. Genesis </p>

<p>93. So Rabens 2013:95. Some suggest that πνεῦμα was thought to consist of </p>
<p>lighter material “stu” than the heavier matter of things such as esh and bone; and </p>
<p>the πνευματικός body is comprised of this lighter substance (e.g., Engberg-Pedersen </p>
<p>2009:125; Martin 1995:21–25, 128). To what extent Paul wished to equate or distinguish </p>
<p>material properties and πνεῦμα, however, remains unclear and risks asking questions </p>
<p>Paul was not attempting to answer. In normal grammatical use the adjectival ending </p>
<p>of -ικος in ψυχικός and πνευματικός generally connote likeness or mode of existence </p>
<p>or having the characteristic of (rather than its substance as with -ινος endings). is </p>
<p>may suggest that the material nature of these bodies is not what is at stake (cf. Brodeur </p>
<p>2004:124, 130; Brown 2014:206, 216). Since the adjective πνευματικός is contrasted </p>
<p>with ψυχικός, it “must similarly refer to the source of the body’s life and activity, de-</p>
<p>scribing the risen body as given life by the Spirit” (Ware 2014b:488–89).</p>

<p>96. With Wright 2003:346. </p>
<p>97. Dierently, Engberg-Pedersen 2009:126–28, likens this transformation to </p>
<p>Aristotle’s view of “substantive change” in which a substance becomes new substance, </p>
<p>rather than a qualitative change in which the substance remains but alters its properties, </p>
<p>qualities, or manner of existence. See discussion in Ware 2014a:828. </p>
