<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>87</p>
<p>and worse men (Lect. 12). Similarly, our earlier quote from Epictetus claims </p>
<p>that the one who has impure thoughts and dirty deeds deles the deity in </p>
<p>himself. It is possible that Paul is ghting re with re by countering Stoic </p>
<p>inuence with Stoic ethics.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>A stronger option (or at least in addition to</p>
<p>this Stoic stream) is that Paul is informed by Sir 19:1–4, which claims that </p>
<p>a man who joins with a prostitute brings destruction on himself.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>To be</p>
<p>sure, other sins aect one’s body also, such as drunkenness, but sexual sins </p>
<p>uniquely join bodies together and thus confuse identity as well as dele.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul perhaps assumes here that no other type of vice physically joins to-</p>
<p>gether bodies as one.</p>
<p>Paul’s second command advances positive engagement—he directs the </p>
<p>Corinthians, glorify God in your body.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>ey are to remain sexually pure,</p>
<p>knowing that they must honor and acknowledge God everywhere, whether </p>
<p>at home, at work, in the marketplace, or in another’s house as a guest. A </p>
<p>double entendre is possible in which the congregation also glories God as </p>
<p>a collective body through worship, fellowship, and service. e reason they </p>
<p>are to honor God is because their bodies are not their own; they have been </p>
<p>bought with a price by Christ. Given that slaves and freedmen comprised </p>
<p>a large portion of Corinth’s population, these words may have special rel-</p>
<p>evance to certain congregants due to purchases and manumission related </p>
<p>to their own bodies (cf. 7:23).</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>Some suggest here a transference from one</p>
<p>owner to another is imagined; the new owner is the Lord of the universe. </p>
<p>e slave gains unprecedented high status by virtue of his/her new master, </p>
<p>and the expectation is that this fortunate slave glories his master because of </p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>Slavery, however, functions as a theological metaphor here related to</p>
<p>Israel being redeemed by God to become God’s covenant people rather than </p>
<p>mere property (e.g., Exod 6:6–9).</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>e Corinthians have been delivered</p>
<p>by the redemptive price of the blood of the crucied Christ; they are set </p>
<p>free from slavery to sin and the fallen world governed by Satan (1:30; 11:25; </p>
<p>Rom 3:24–25; 5:9; Col 1:20; cf. Eph 1:7; 2:13). At the same time, Paul’s words </p>
<p>may evoke the hire of both a prostitute and slave. What he portrays parallels </p>
<p>Hosea’s purchase of a prostitute named Gomer from the slave block as a pic-</p>
<p>ture of God’s redemptive love for his people. Hosea makes the purchase so </p>
