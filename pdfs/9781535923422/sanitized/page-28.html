<p>in or near the city included those venerating Aphrodite, Poseidon, Apollo, </p>
<p>Demeter and Kore, and Asclepius. e various deities associated with the </p>
<p>twenty-six sacred locations in Corinth described by Pausanius complement </p>
<p>Paul’s words to the Corinthians that there are “gods many and lords many” </p>
<p>(1 Cor 8:5).</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> e imperial cult was also strongly present with Julio-Claudi-</p>
an portraits on the east side of the forum, an altar to Divus (divine) Julius
<p>Caesar, and a statue of Divus Augustus Caesar in the middle of the forum.</p>

<p>Acts 18:4 also locates a Jewish synagogue in the city during Paul’s visit. An </p>
<p>inscription identifying the “Synagogue of the Hebrews” was excavated in the </p>
<p>city (CIJ I§718). Certain scholars have dated it in a time frame compatible </p>
<p>with Acts, but its origin may be much later.</p>

<p>Jewish community living in rst-century Corinth (Legat. 281).</p>
<p>Corinthian Mythology</p>
<p>Although the Corinthians boasted of their origin in the hero Corinthus </p>
<p>as the son of Zeus, other Greeks did not believe this familial tie.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Ephyra,</p>
<p>daughter of the sea Titan, Oceanus, was said to dwell rst in Corinth. Some </p>
<p>prominent mythological stories about Corinthians are as follows.</p>
<p>e cray king Sisyphus was one of Corinth’s earliest rulers. Zeus </p>
<p>punishes him for exposing one of Zeus’s illicit aairs. He sends anatos </p>
<p>(death) to take Sisyphus’s life, but the king binds up this deity until Ares, god </p>
<p>of war, frees anatos so that he could accomplish his mission. e dead </p>
<p>Sisyphus then tricks Hades, god of the underworld, into letting him return </p>
<p>to life temporarily so that he could arrange his own funeral proceedings. </p>
<p>But he never returns to Hades and lives to a ripe old age. Aer he dies again, </p>
<p>Sisyphus’s punishment is to roll a boulder perpetually up a hill only to have </p>
<p>it roll back down again once he gets near the top. A temple was built for him </p>
<p>on the Acrocorinth.</p>
