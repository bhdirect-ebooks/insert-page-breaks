<p>games (cf. Seutonius Claud. 21; Apuleius, Metam. 4.13).</p>
<p>190</p>
<p>In these games</p>
<p>the noxii, or condemned criminals, frequently were captives of war, though </p>
<p>other unwilling participants may include local criminals, deserters, and </p>
<p>rebel slaves.</p>
<p>191</p>
<p>eir death became a source of entertainment that might</p>
<p>include being thrown to beasts, burned with re, crucied, or made to play </p>
<p>“fatal charades” in which they were forced to play popular roles that in-</p>
<p>cluded their actual death.</p>
<p>192</p>
<p>Likewise, an unskilled gladiator normally died</p>
<p>in the arena.</p>
<p>193</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul’s spectacle is presented not only to Romans but also to the world </p>
<p>and to angels and humans, with God as the editor, the benefactor who </p>
<p>supports the event nancially.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p>Both heaven and earth, then, witness the</p>
<p>apostles suering, which has the eect of prompting Corinthian pathos due </p>
<p>to the magnitude of ignominy endured by Paul in conformity to his calling </p>
<p>that recalls the cruciform Christ. Paul’s audience is indirectly prompted to </p>
<p>choose between its desire for elitist wisdom, power, and eminence, or the </p>
<p>apostolic plight viewed by the world as foolish, weak, and disreputable </p>
<p>scum whose lives do not matter. A reality check for the Corinthians might </p>
<p>remind them that they, too, resemble the apostle (cf. 1:26–27).</p>
<p>195</p>
<p>But in</p>
<p>Paul’s ironic scene they are imagined instead as royal, rich, and satised </p>
<p>elitists. ey are the ones who take the best seats in this arena as they watch </p>
<p>the bloody spectacle. Paul’s call for them to be his imitators, then, might </p>
<p>compel them to get out of their privileged seats as spectators and jump into </p>
<p>the arena with the apostle.</p>
<p>196</p>
<p>e catalogue of hardships Paul experiences is composed of triadic </p>
<p>sets (4:11–13). Although “we” is used, Paul thinks foremost of his own ex-</p>
<p>periences and secondarily of any colleagues who happen to be with him to </p>
<p>share them.</p>
<p>197</p>
<p>e rst set is hunger, thirst, poorly clothed (cf. 2<span class="ls1c ws59"> C<span class="_ _1" />or </span>11:27;</p>
<p>Phil 4:12). ese are bodily setbacks the apostle experiences during his mis-</p>
<p>sionary travels, which may indirectly apply to the conditions of captives of </p>
<p>190. Nguyen 2007:495 –98. Corinth also had death spectacles (Nguyen 2007:492; </p>
<p>Walters 2005:405–6), but the sources reect a time later than Paul’s.</p>
