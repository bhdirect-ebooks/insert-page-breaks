<p>sophist debater of this age? nds no parallel in Isaiah.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Stephen Pogolo</p>
<p>is apropos that the last of the three questions “most naturally refers to the </p>
<p>rhetorician skilled at declamation and extemporaneous courtroom displays. </p>
<p>Increasingly, such persons were called sophists, and were sought by all sta-</p>
<p>tus seekers as prizes.”</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Paul apparently wants to make sure that his auditors</p>
<p>do not miss the point that this question pertains to the way they esteem </p>
<p>oratory performances. All the same, three inquiries begin with “where” and </p>
<p>are probably informed by the threefold pattern in Isa 33:18. e questions </p>
<p>prompt the response that clever and prominent speakers are nowhere to be </p>
<p>found at the time of the Lord’s visitation. Paul’s fourth question, Has not </p>
<p>God made foolish the wisdom of this world? may come from Isa 44:25 </p>
<p>where the Lord again turns the advice of wise counselors into foolishness.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes” is the answer Paul expects from Corinthians. </p>
<p>Our apostle recontextualizes Isaiah’s discourse in order to associ-</p>
ate human counsel void of divine direction with the wisdom of this age
<p>characterized by sophists and royal elitists (cf. 1 Cor 2:4–8). rough Isa-</p>
iah the relevant message for the Corinthians is that divine wisdom stands over against worldly wisdom; the latter incurs divine judgment, and there
<p>is an anticipation in which the absence of true wisdom will be remedied.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Whereas the concept of foolishness turns out to be antithetical to this wis-</p>
<p>dom, Paul presents a reverse ordering in which proclamation of the cruci-</p>
<p>ed Messiah, perceived by the wise in this world as foolishness, has become </p>
the means by which divine wisdom is revealed. is wisdom, incidentally, is
<p>not measured by the entertainment value of the speaker’s performance, nor </p>
by the weight of eloquent words used, but by the divine mind’s penetrating
<p>and disclosing insights communicated through God’s Spirit by his messen-</p>
<p>gers (cf. 2:6–16). Such wisdom is not recognized by worldly wisdom; the </p>
<p>latter is foolish in comparison.</p>
<p>Both Jews and Gentiles can accept or reject the message of the cross </p>
<p>(1:22–24). Unbelieving Jews ask for signs which seem related to miraculous </p>
<p>proofs verifying Jesus as Messiah (Mark 8:11; 15:29–32; John 6:30). is re-</p>
<p>quest, as Ciampa and Rosner arm, does not reect an “open-minded plea, </p>
<p>but an obstinate insistence on powerful conrmation of God’s deliverance </p>
<p>position in Ephesus (where Paul happens to be as he writes 1 Cor). is meaning seems </p>
<p>more appropriate for 1:20.</p>
<p>12. On συζητητής as a sophist, see Meyer 1877:1.38–39.</p>
<p>13. Pogolo 1992:160.</p>
<p>14. Wilk 2005:139, shows that active forms of the verb μωραίνω (“to make foolish”) </p>
<p>connect these texts.</p>
<p>15. ese themes are also prevalent in other Jewish literature, as Williams 2001:61–</p>
<p>81 demonstrates.</p>
