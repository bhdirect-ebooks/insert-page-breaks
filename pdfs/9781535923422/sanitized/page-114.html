<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>90</p>
<p>this passage; his advice is a matter of what is good, benecial, and permissible </p>
<p>for the Corinthians (7:6; cf. 12, 25, 35). At the same time, this word may echo </p>
<p>the context of Gen 2:18—the Lord God said that “it is not good (καλόν) that </p>
<p>the man (Adam) be alone,” so he proceeded to create woman (Eve), which </p>
<p>resulted in the rst couple. Paul may be recontextualizing these thoughts so </p>
<p>that, unlike the original couple, what is good now pertains to the new cre-</p>
<p>ation in Christ (cf. 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15). e old world order, and its creation </p>
<p>with Adam and Eve, is now passing away along with its rulers, institutes, </p>
<p>Satan, and fornication (7:31). In the new creation, when it fully arrives, even </p>
<p>marriage as an institute will be completely transformed to represent purely </p>
<p>the union between believers and Christ (cf. 6:13c– 17, 20). e apostle seems </p>
<p>to agree with a saying attributed to Jesus that in the coming age, humans </p>
<p>neither marry nor are given in marriage (Mark 12:25; Luke 20:34–35; Matt </p>
<p>22:30). is new creation discourse attaches goodness to celibacy, which for </p>
<p>Paul is even better than human marriage (7:1, 8). For emergent Christians, </p>
<p>then, the primary paradigm for bodily union is not the prevailing norm of </p>
<p>their day, nor the old creation model of marriage in Genesis, but the new </p>
<p>creation model in Christ, the sphere in which all believers are joined to the </p>
<p>Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>Contrary to what our culture today might assume, Paul’s model</p>
<p>shows that our longing for and nding a lifetime partner is not the ultimate </p>
<p>goal of human existence. Union with Christ lls that role.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Paul is well aware that the new creation has not fully </p>
<p>arrived. Various present age tensions in Adam, such as fornication, sexual </p>
<p>passions, and a lack of self-control agitated by Satan are still prominent in-</p>
<p>uences. With this recognition he concedes to the second best alternative </p>
<p>in 7:2, and together 7:1–2 seems to enact the commands from 6:18 and 20.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e plural fornications refer to multiple types of sexual relations outside </p>
<p>the realm of marriage, which can be avoided by letting each man have his </p>
<p>own wife, and each woman have her own husband. ere is no compelling </p>
<p>reason why we must decide between Paul telling single men to get married </p>
<p>and have sex, or his telling married men to have more sex in their already </p>
<p>existing marriages.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p> Both can be meant.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p> Likewise, since Paul is respond-</p>
<p>ing to Corinthian inquiries rather than giving them a comprehensive tome </p>
<p>about Christian marital sex, we should not read too much into his silence on </p>
<p>121. On prevailing expectations of marriage in Roman and Jewish culture, see </p>
<p>Crocker 2004:150–52.</p>
<p>122. See von aden 2012:263–64.</p>
<p>123. On the former, see Caragounis 1996:547–48; 2006:196–98; the latter, Fee </p>
<p>1987:278–79; 2003:209–211.</p>
<p>124. e present imperative “have” (ἐχέτω) can refer to sexual intercourse (cf. Deut </p>
<p>28:30; Isa 13:16) or to marry/be in a married state (7:29; Tob 3:8BA; John 4:17–18).</p>
