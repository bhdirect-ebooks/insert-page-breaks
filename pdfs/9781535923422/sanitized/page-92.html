<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>68</p>
<p>spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>e “esh” and “spirit” here</p>
<p>refer respectively to the man’s physical body (6:16; 15:39; 2 Cor 4:11) and </p>
<p>inner person (2:11; 7:34; 14:14).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>e parallel Pauline punishment in 1 Tim</p>
<p>1:19–20 is also in hope of remedial benet for the culprit, complementary </p>
<p>with this interpretation. </p>
<p>Since the oender is expelled from the church, he must fend for him-</p>
<p>self as an outsider associated with the fallen world that is destined to perish </p>
<p>and where anti-god powers such as Satan rule (2:6; Gal 1:4; 2 Cor 4:4; cf. </p>
<p>Eph 2:2). With this apocalyptic imagery Paul seems to combine notions </p>
<p>of purity and protection informed by the Passover discourse.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>In Exod 12</p>
<p>“the Destroyer” (ὁ ὀλεθρεύων: 12:23LXX) refers to an angel who brought </p>
<p>death to those who did not have their homes protected by the blood of the </p>
<p>Passover lamb.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> Paul’s related term for destruction here, ὄλεθρος, may sug-</p>
<p>gest a recontextualization of this Passover event. e messenger of death </p>
<p>is now Satan who brings destruction on those who are not covered by the </p>
<p>blood, the sacricial death of the crucied Christ who redeems the faithful </p>
<p>(5:7; cf. 1:30; 6:20). One of two possibilities account for the incestuous man’s </p>
<p>destruction: 1) he no longer has any spiritual protection, and so his physical </p>
<p>death is expected to happen, perhaps supernaturally;</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>or 2) Paul anticipates</p>
<p>the man’s arrest by civil authorities who will beat and/or execute him for </p>
<p>the crime of incest.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Paul may imagine the rulers of this age—judges and</p>
<p>magistrates—to be inadvertently part of Satan’s realm (2:6–8).</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Either way,</p>
<p>as the man faces a potential death sentence, Paul hopes he will repent. At </p>
<p>least this way even if his earthly esh is destroyed in death, he will be saved </p>
<p>and his spirit will be with the Lord (2 Cor 5:6–8; Phil 1:20–24); and in the </p>
<p>coming age he will be raised bodily from the dead (15:20–56).</p>
<p>Paul’s verdict is swi and uncompromising, unlike the repetitive at-</p>
<p>tempts to restore oenders before banishing them as taught in Matthew </p>
<p>15. Rightly, Moses 2013:176; Konradt 2003:315–17.</p>
<p>16. For other interpretations, see Pascuzzi 1997:114–17. e “spirit” of the church </p>
<p>or Holy Spirit is not meant; Paul always speaks of being saved in reference to humans </p>
<p>(cf. 1:18; 3:15; 9:22; 10:33; 15:2). And if “esh” meant sinful nature here, it makes no </p>
<p>sense that Satan would destroy it (see further Oropeza 2012a:78–82).</p>
<p>17. Cf. Moses 2013:186.</p>
<p>18. See also 1 Cor 10:10; Heb 11:28; Philo Leg. All. 2.34; BDAG 703.</p>
<p>19. Cf. 11:30; Acts 5:3–10; Allo 1956:123; Robertson/Plummer 1925:99.</p>
<p>20. See Derrett 1979:11–30. If this view is correct, however, Paul does not appear to </p>
<p>be advocating congregants to physically hand this man over to be arrested but believes </p>
that without divine protection his arrest is inevitable.
<p>21. Paul’s own apparent persecution by authorities is explained as Satan’s attack in </p>
<p>1 ess 2:18.</p>
