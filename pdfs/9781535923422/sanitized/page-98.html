<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>74</p>
<p>If the offender is a relative, what boundaries, if any, might I need to imple-</p>
<p>ment if the offender visits for the holidays or comes to a special family </p>
<p>event? These and similar questions are worth probing as we determine the </p>
<p>best course of action to take. </p>
<p>e rhetorical questions in 5:12 are essentially answered in 5:13. God judges </p>
<p>outsiders who commit vice, and Paul and Christ’s community are permit-</p>
<p>ted to judge insiders who commit vice. Obviously, Paul distinguishes such </p>
<p>judgment from the Corinthians judging him (4:3–5). e distinction is that </p>
<p>they judge according to the worldly standards of this age, and he, a spiritual </p>
<p>man, judges with the mind of Christ (2:15–16). e apostle’s decision on </p>
<p>vice-doers who profess to be Christ’s followers, of which the incestuous man </p>
<p>exemplies and is foregrounded here, integrates a repetitive phrase from </p>
<p>Deuteronomy on expulsion—drive out the wicked person from among </p>
<p>you (Deut 17:7; 19:19; 21:21; 22:21, 24; 24:27).</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>If we must narrow down</p>
<p>these verses, Deut 22:21–24 perhaps best ts Paul’s aim because it uses </p>
<p>the phrase in relation to fornication. Moreover, its proximity to Deut 23:1 </p>
<p>(22:30 MT) contextually links the vice with the prohibition against sexual </p>
<p>relations with one’s step mother. In Deuteronomy, covenant transgressors </p>
<p>are cut o from Israel’s community oen by execution. In Paul’s recon-</p>
<p>guration, however, Satan is involved in the potential execution of the man </p>
<p>expelled from Christ’s community. Paul adopts the Deuteronomic phrase </p>
<p>for his Gentile audience with the assumption that they are included among </p>
<p>God’s people and have inherited their own covenant privileges as well as </p>
<p>obligations that include sanctions against covenant disloyalty.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>is pattern</p>
<p>he adopts for believers whose founder at the Last Supper established a new </p>
<p>covenant (11:25).</p>
<p>Court Litigations between Believers (6:1–11)</p>
<p>Judgment against the fornicator with the use of Deuteronomic legal texts </p>
<p>and insider/outsider language prompt our apostle to continue along the </p>
<p>topic of judgment.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>His emotions are still running high from the previous</p>
<p>46. All these verses correspond verbally with our text, and a variation of the phrase </p>
<p>is found in Deut 13:6 (Waters 2013:2). Paul does not use a citation formula with his </p>
<p>quote, which has the rhetorical eect of heightening pathos in this emotionally charged </p>
<p>passage (Ciampa/Rosner 2010:220).</p>
<p>47. See Heil 2005:89–90; Waters 2013:1, 4–5.</p>
<p>48. McDonough 2005:99–102, goes further to suggest judgment in Deut 17:2–7 </p>
