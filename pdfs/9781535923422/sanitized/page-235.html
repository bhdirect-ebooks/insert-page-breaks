<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>
<p>211</p>
<p>provoke his auditors to feel sympathy for him. He constantly faces mission-</p>
<p>ary hardships so that Gentiles like them might be saved.</p>
<p>e fourth question centers on his current opposition from where he </p>
<p>writes this letter: If . . . I fought with wild beasts in Ephesus, what benet </p>
<p>is it to me? (cf. 16:8–9; 2 Cor 1:8–11). It is unlikely that Paul would survive </p>
<p>an ordeal of being literally sentenced ad bestias. If he is a Roman citizen he </p>
<p>would be exempt from arena battles with beasts (Justinian Digest, 28.1.8.4; </p>
<p>cf. Acts 22:25–29).</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>His words from a human standpoint probably means</p>
<p>that what he communicates here should be understood in a popular or gu-</p>
<p>rative way (cf. 9:8; Gal 3:15; Rom 3:5; 6:19).</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>Paul probably faces human</p>
<p>opposition that may reect a conict with the devotees of the goddess Arte-</p>
<p>mis (Diana), who was commonly associated and depicted with animals and </p>
<p>known as the “mistress of wild beasts” (Homer Il. 21.468–470).</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>If so, he</p>
<p>presents here “an allusive instance of anti-Artemis rhetoric.”</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>Luke seems</p>
<p>to corroborate this interpretation by claiming that Paul faced opposition in </p>
<p>Ephesus from followers of this goddess (Acts 19:21–41).</p>
<p>As surely as errant belief leads to errant behavior, Paul expresses </p>
<p>the inevitable outcome of denying the resurrection:</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>If the dead are not</p>
<p>raised, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!” A well-known exam-</p>
<p>ple of moral abandonment in the face of death takes place in Athens during </p>
<p>the great pestilence associated with the Peloponnesian War (ucycides </p>
<p>Hist. 2. 52.3–53.4). But Paul more likely derives his words from Isa 22:13.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jerusalem is on the brink of being invaded by Assyrians, and instead of </p>
<p>showing signs of remorse or praying for the Lord’s help, inhabitants de-</p>
<p>cide to have an indulgent party instead, knowing their doom is near. is </p>
<p>immoral behavior related to feasting plays a sarcastic note in which Paul </p>
<p>intimates Corinthian behavior when causing weak members to stumble </p>
<p>on account of their consumption of idol foods, and being inconsiderate </p>
<p>to poor members because of their overindulgences and getting drunk at </p>
<p>the Lord’s Supper (8:1–13; 11:17–34). eir conduct at these meals reects </p>
depraved individuals who shun accountability to God and act as though
<p>this life is all there is.</p>
