<p>Fourth Supporting Proof (11:2—14:40)</p>
<p>160</p>
<p>in antithesis to the living God. With this language Paul may be imagin-</p>
<p>ing a pompe or cultic procession celebrated in cities like Corinth in which </p>
<p>devotees were “marched away” in public viewing to arrive at a sanctuary </p>
<p>where cultic images are seen and sacrices made.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>Another possibility is</p>
<p>that they are imagined being led away (ἀπάγω) as slaves or prisoners.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>so, this may suggest the Corinthians were formerly entrapped by idolatrous </p>
<p>and evil spiritual powers (10:20; Gal 4:3, 8–9).</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>But now they are to be led</p>
<p>by God’s Spirit (Rom 8:14; Gal 5:18).</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since the Corinthians should not be ignorant about spiritual matters, </p>
<p>they are informed in 12:3 that no one speaking by the agency of God’s Spir-</p>
<p>it says, “Jesus be cursed!” Winter suggests from curse tablets uncovered </p>
<p>near the Demeter and Persephone cult precincts in Corinth, among other </p>
<p>sources, that the curse reects an invocation of Jesus to curse one’s enemies.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some of the believers were practicing this, and Paul condemns it. On this </p>
<p>view Ἀνάθεμα Ἰησοῦς means “Jesus [gives or grants] a curse.”</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>But this is</p>
<p>rather questionable since Paul himself has no problem invoking a curse on </p>
<p>those who do not love Jesus (16:22). Another possibility is that, prior to </p>
<p>conversion, a congregation member once either blurted out this curse or </p>
<p>heard someone else do so in an idolatrous setting or local synagogue.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>suggest instead that Paul may be recollecting his own experience. Prior to </p>
<p>his transformation, as a persecutor of Christ’s followers, he used to compel </p>
<p>believers to utter this curse and revile the name of Jesus. It became proof of </p>
<p>renouncing one’s faith in Christ (Acts 26:11; cf. Gal 3:13; 1 Tim 1:13).</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>later decades, those accused of being Christians under Emperor Trajan were </p>
<p>compelled to revile the name of Christ since no genuine Christian would </p>
<p>ever do this (Pliny Ep. 10.96). Paul may be contrasting de-conversion (apos-</p>
<p>tasy) with conversion. e phrase, “Jesus be cursed,” stands in antithesis to </p>
<p>the claim, “Jesus is Lord” that is part of one’s confession at conversion (6:11; </p>
<p>Rom 10:9–13; Col 2:6; cf. Acts 2:21, 38; 22:16). is confession invites the </p>
<p>Spirit to dwell with the neophyte and ushers that person into the corporate </p>
<p>102. See Paige 1991:57 –65; Horsley, 1998:168; on the quote: Collins 1999:447.</p>
<p>103. Arzt-Grabner et al. 2006:410–12. Is Paul once again imagining prisoners of </p>
<p>war (or animals: Paige 1991:63) in a triumphal procession being led away to be killed? </p>
<p>Whatever the case, ἀπάγω does not appear to connote an ecstatic state (see Schnabel </p>
<p>2006:683–86).</p>
