<p>his view, inter alia, since Christian assemblies met weekly instead of the </p>
<p>standard annual festival for civic gods or the monthly meetings prescribed </p>
<p>by Roman rules for association meetings, this may have raised questions for </p>
<p>the latter of possible political sedition.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>Since Christian homes were open to</p>
<p>visitors (14:23), political informants might be sent to observe the peculiari-</p>
<p>ties of this sect that, like the Jews, worship one invisible god, but unlike the </p>
<p>Jews, had no legally exempt status to do so. Likewise, anyone with “civic sta-</p>
<p>tus or wealth whose curiosity was aroused about Christian faith would not </p>
<p>go to any meeting without having a client or others rst carry back reports </p>
<p>of its activities.”</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>By women not covering themselves and thus symbolizing</p>
<p>disregard for their marital status—and men wearing coverings like elitist </p>
<p>priests to draw attention to their status—Paul was concerned that outsiders </p>
<p>and messengers might get the wrong impression of Christian gatherings.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With this understanding intact, although these messengers might nd that </p>
<p>covered Christian men resembled Roman piety (though unacceptable for </p>
<p>Paul, as we addressed above), they might also interpret the women’s lack </p>
<p>of headgear as deant toward marital protocols. Paul thus encourages the </p>
<p>women worshippers to exhibit themselves in a way that dismantles poten-</p>
<p>tial criticisms from outsiders and invites these outsiders instead to be more </p>
<p>open to receive their prophecies (14:24–25).</p>
<p>e qualication, nevertheless, neither is woman independent of </p>
<p>man nor man independent of woman in the Lord rearms earlier teach-</p>
<p>ings about gender equality in the Lord Jesus Christ (see Gal 3:28).</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>Such</p>
<p>equality anticipates life in the new creation, an era that when fully realized </p>
<p>will do away even with the old creation in which Adam was prior to Eve. </p>
<p>Paul arms that neither gender exists apart from the other (11:11–12); </p>
<p>man and woman in the present are mutually dependent for procreation, </p>
and they are distinct and divinely created that way since all things are
<p>from God.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>Our apostle then prompts the Corinthians to say “no” to his</p>
<p>question, is it proper for a woman to pray to God uncovered? And they </p>
<p>are to say “yes” to his question that asks whether nature itself teaches that </p>
<p>40. Winter 2001:133–34. Although the magistrate Gallio saw them as no threat </p>
<p>(Acts 18:12–17), his appointment ended a few years before Paul wrote 1 Corinthians </p>
<p>(135). </p>

<p>43. However, 11:11–16 does not demarcate Paul’s view as opposed to the Corinthi-</p>
<p>ans’ alleged view in 11:3–10 (Pace, Peppiatt 2015:66–84, 102). Nowhere in Paul do we </p>
<p>nd such a prolonged oppositional viewpoint, and there are no clear indicators for it </p>
<p>(e.g., positing an inquiry and then refuting it with μὴ γένοιτο: 6:15; Rom 6:1–2).</p>
<p>44. See Gen. 1:31; Isa 45:7; Amos 5:8; Heil 2005:175.</p>
