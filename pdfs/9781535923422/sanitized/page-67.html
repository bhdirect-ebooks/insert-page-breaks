<p>they have been feeding o the metaphoric staples of self-emulation, status </p>
<p>seeking, and competitive oratory evaluations.</p>
<p>eir current state and behavior are described as eshly,</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>and this</p>
<p>predicament evokes the Corinthians to see themselves in similar light with </p>
the natural person who being void of God’s Spirit nds divine wisdom
<p>incomprehensible (2:13).</p>
<p>102</p>
<p> To be eshly in this regard is to walk in a hu-</p>
<p>man way, that is, they regularly conduct themselves in accordance with the </p>
<p>people of this age who are subject to vices and ideologies contrary to the </p>
<p>new creation in Christ. If we tease out this line of inference, the implicit </p>
<p>way they should be walking is in the Spirit, as being in conformity with the </p>
<p>Spirit’s guidance and exercising moral virtues such as love, peace, kindness, </p>
<p>and meekness (cf. Gal 5:16–25). </p>
<p>eir behavior exhibits envy and discord.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>Both appear in Paul’s</p>
<p>vice lists, and their practice results in eternal consequences (Gal 5:19–21; 2 </p>
<p>Cor 12:20; Rom 13:13). e latter vice (ἔρις) we explored in relation to the </p>
congregation’s divisive allegiances (1:11–12), though here only the main ri-
<p>valry between I am of Paul and I am of Apollos is stressed. e former vice </p>
<p>(ζῆλος) connotes a type of zeal or envy which harms rather than helps oth-</p>
<p>ers, being concerned primarily about one’s own advancement.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>It also may</p>
<p>arise when a person feels le behind by another’s upward mobility (Cicero, </p>
<p>De or. 2.52.209) and connote competition that benets one’s group while </p>
<p>leading to dishonor others (Jas 3:13–16). Clement, writing to the Corinthi-</p>
<p>ans a generation aer Paul, provides examples of envy from Israel’s scrip-</p>
<p>tures, each having harmful consequences including Cain’s envy over Abel, </p>
<p>Jacob’s sons over Joseph, and Saul over David (1 Clem. 3.1–6.4 cf. Gen 4, </p>
<p>37; 1 Sam 18). More contemporary with Paul’s time, Caligula became envi-</p>
<p>ous of Seneca’s eloquence and contemplated ordering his death (Cassius Dio </p>
<p>59.19.6–8; cf. Suetonius Calig. 53.2). What Paul perhaps fears is a congrega-</p>
<p>tional scene similar to one witnessed in Corinth’s vicinity by Dio Chrysos-</p>
<p>tom in which quarreling among sophist students devolved into a shouting </p>
<p>and abusive match (Or. 8.9). As Bruce Winter points out, “the conduct of the </p>
<p>101. iselton 2000:288–89, rightly distinguishes the two “eshly” terms here as </p>
<p>follows: “σάρκινος [3:1] means moved by entirely human drives, while σαρκικός [3:3] </p>
<p>means moved by self-interest.” Garland 2003:109, adds, “e –ινος sux connotes </p>
<p>‘made of’ (cf. 2 Cor. 3:3), while the –ικός sux connotes ‘characterized by’ (cf. 9:11).”</p>
<p>102. One distinction, however, is that God’s Spirit dwells in and among the Corin-</p>
<p>thians, and they belong to the Lord—they are babes in Christ.</p>
<p>103. Some manuscripts of 3:3 add “dissensions” (διχοστασίαι), but its absence in </p>
<p>others is hard to explain unless it was not in the original text (Metzger 1994:482–83).</p>

<p>generally, Malina 2001:108–33.</p>
