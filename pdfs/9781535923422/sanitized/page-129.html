<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>105</p>
<p>Roman engagements could be ended by letter or person, and dowry or gis </p>
<p>might be returned if already given.</p>
<p>193</p>
<p>Normally, the father was the one who</p>
<p>could break up the couple, but Julius Caesar at sixteen broke o his own </p>
<p>relationship with Cossutia (Suetonius Jul. 1.1). Joseph is also portrayed at-</p>
<p>tempting to end his own engagement to Mary (Matt 1:18–19).</p>
<p>A turn of subjects takes place from the betrothed in 7:37 to the father </p>
<p>in 7:38: he (the father) who gives her (the daughter) in marriage does well, </p>
<p>but he who does not give her in marriage does better. is change of sub-</p>
<p>jects is not as abrupt as it rst might appear.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p>e father or patriarch of the</p>
<p>household normally gives the bride in marriage, and Paul is well aware of </p>
<p>this custom (2 Cor 11:2–3). In arranged marriages parents have a voice in </p>
<p>the relationship.</p>
<p>195</p>
<p>Without the father giving away the bride here, we run into</p>
<p>an unrealistic portrait of rst-century weddings in which parents play no </p>
<p>major role in the decision of their virgin daughter. With these concluding </p>
<p>words that sound like a maxim, Paul remains consistent with his view of </p>
<p>celibacy by conrming that it is good for couples to marry, but it is even </p>
<p>better if they stay single.</p>
<p>As is typical in patriarchal societies, the male gure initiates the mar-</p>
<p>riage, and the virgin female, perhaps as young as 14 years old, has no voice, </p>
<p>unlike older women such as widows, whom Paul addresses in 7:39–40.</p>
<p>196</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Perhaps Paul returns to this subject from 7:8 because he now wants to </p>
<p>specify that believers who become widows aer their conversion could en-</p>
<p>joy the same freedom as widows who were already widows when they were </p>
<p>converted. She is bound by marriage to her believing husband as long as </p>
<p>he lives, but if her husband has fallen asleep in death, she is free to be </p>
<p>married to whom she wishes. Paul uses the metaphor of falling asleep as </p>
<p>representing death only in reference to believers (11:30; 15:6, 18, 20; 1 ess </p>
<p>4:13–15). ere is no reason to suppose, however, that the same privilege </p>
<p>would not apply if her deceased husband were not a believer. Likewise, we </p>
<p>assume that a husband whose wife dies is permitted remarriage under the </p>
<p>same circumstances. Perhaps for brevity’s sake Paul does not include wid-</p>
<p>193. Cf. Treggiari 1991b:156–57. </p>
<p>194. e active imperative of γαμέω, “let them marry” (7:36c), is something the </p>
<p>betrothed or couple does (cf. 7:28), whereas γαμίζω (7:38) normally means giving (a </p>
<p>woman) in marriage (Matt 24:38; Mark 12:25), which is something the father does. </p>
<p>Although the verbal ending–ίζω does not need to be causative and could mean “make </p>
<p>a marriage” (Lietzmann/Kümmel 1949:35–36), Fitzmyer 2008:327, notices that no one </p>
<p>has documented a case in which γαμίζω is non-causative, unless here. NKJV is a com-</p>
<p>mendable translation of 7:36–38.</p>
