<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>

<p>her aer death. If this is the correct interpretation, neither Paul nor other </p>
<p>apostles teach it.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p> Paul identies its practitioners as “they,” pointing to an-</p>
<p>other group distinct from his colleagues and himself. Certain Corinthians </p>
<p>apparently practice this, and Paul assumes the deniers, if they do not do it </p>
<p>themselves, at least accept the legitimacy of others practicing it. He himself </p>
<p>seems ambivalent to it, neither conrming nor denying that proxy baptism </p>
<p>is ecacious for the dead. He only mentions this practice for the sake of </p>
<p>argument. Since baptism signies the bodily enactment of dying and ris-</p>
<p>ing again (Rom 6:4), and certain Corinthians take initiative to perform this </p>
<p>enactment in place of the dead, it follows that they should believe in bodily </p>
<p>resurrection and the hope of one day being reunited with those for whom </p>
<p>they were baptized. </p>
<p>A second perspective interprets “for” as causal with the meaning of </p>
baptism “on account of” the dead. is imagines unbaptized individuals,
<p>perhaps at emergent Christian funerals, deciding to get baptized in order to </p>
<p>be reunited aer death with their deceased loved ones who were baptized </p>
<p>believers.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>Despite any mixed motives for doing so, they get baptized “on</p>
<p>account of” or because of the inuence of these dead believers. With either </p>
<p>view, it is assumed that these Corinthians believe through baptism that one’s </p>
<p>new life and washing away of sins is inclusive of one’s body. Likewise, they </p>
<p>believe in life aer death, which then precludes their acceptance of views </p>
<p>that do not, such as Epicurean philosophy.</p>
<p>Paul’s third and fourth questions address persecutions that he and oth-</p>
<p>er apostles experience (15:30, 32a).</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> e third question addresses the con-</p>
<p>stant nature of this hardship: And why are we in danger every hour? . . . I </p>
<p>face death daily. e hyperbolic “every hour” highlights the repetitive na-</p>
<p>ture of his hardships (cf. Rom 8:36; 2 Cor 4:10). His dying daily, which he </p>
<p>conrms by oath, involves more than mere bodily jeopardies but also his </p>
<p>own determination to die to himself and oer his body as a self-sacrice to </p>
<p>fulll his calling as a missionary in the face of opposition.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> An oral tradi-</p>
<p>tion originating from Jesus perhaps stands behind this idea—disciples must </p>
<p>take up their crosses when following Jesus, implying a constant denial of </p>
<p>self (Matt 10:38; 16:24; Mark 8:34; Luke 9:23).</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>Paul elicits pathos aiming to</p>
<p>63. Early church fathers will consider its practitioners to be aberrant or heretical: </p>
<p>e.g., Marcionites, Cerenthians (cf. Tertullian Marc. 5.10; Epiphanius Pan. 28.6; further, </p>
<p>Garland 2003:717).</p>
<p>64. E.g., Reaume 1995; iselton 2000:1248–49.</p>
<p>65. “We” in these verses excludes the Corinthians; they were not being persecuted.</p>
<p>66. See Edwards 1885:425–26.</p>
<p>67. Luke’s version adds “daily.” Ps 44[43]:22–23 also comes close to this.</p>
