<p>Introduction</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Of the names of seventeen members mentioned by Paul or Acts (1 </p>
<p>Cor 1:1, 11, 14; 16:17, 19; Rom 16:1, 21–23; Acts 18:2, 7–8), nine are Greek </p>
<p>(Achaicus, Chloe, Crispus, Sosthenes, Stephanas, Erastus, Jason, Phoebe, </p>
<p>and Sosipater) and eight are Latin (Aquila, Prisca, Fortunatus, Gaius, Lu-</p>
<p>cius, Quartus, Tertius, and Justus).</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>Among these, Crispus, Aquila, Prisca,</p>
<p>and possibly Sosthenes, are Jews, but the church mostly consists of Gen-</p>
<p>tiles when Paul writes this letter (1 Cor 8:7; 12:27; cf. Acts 18:6). e Latin </p>
<p>names suggest that a number of congregants may be inuenced by Roman </p>
<p>culture with perhaps a few to several possibly belonging to the upper ech-</p>
<p>elons of society, such as Gaius who houses a church. Among the Greek </p>
<p>names, Phoebe, Stephanas, Crispus, and possibly Sosthenes and Erastus </p>
<p>might have some prominent social standing.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p> Erastus served in a civic ad-</p>
<p>ministrative capacity as oikonomos for the city (Rom 16:23; see 1 Cor 4:1). </p>
<p>It is very questionable, however, that this is the same Erastus named from </p>
<p>the famous Corinthian inscription who was an aedile in Corinth.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> Regard-</p>
<p>ing this congregation, Gerd eissen’s observation is still quite plausible </p>
<p>from 1:26–29. When Paul writes that “not many” of the Corinthians were </p>
<p>wise, powerful, and noble born, this implies that some of them were.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> I re-</p>
gard this congregation as quite diverse and having many members from the
<p>lower classes, but a minority are well-to-do. is minority are those who </p>
<p>can aord to purchase meat routinely at the macellum (10:25), be invited </p>
<p>to dinners (10:27), and “have” better food at the Lord’s Supper (11:17–34).</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a church they are better o nancially than the Macedonian congrega-</p>
<p>tions, which in turn are better o than the poor in Jerusalem for whom </p>
<p>they contribute money (16:1–4; 2 Cor 8:1–5). </p>

<p>1998:50–59 (cf. 2001:85–94), who argues the church was in abject poverty. Friesen </p>
<p>2005:351–70 (cf. 2004:323–61) has the Corinthian congregation at “level six,” at or </p>
<p>around bare subsistence level and one step away from the lowest poverty. See responses </p>
<p>in eissen 2001:65–84; eissen 2003:371–91; iselton 2000:23–29; Martin 2001:51–</p>
<p>64; Barclay 2004:363–66; Mihaila 2009:94–109. Recently, Sanders 2014:103–125, mod-</p>
<p>erately suggests a “middling” population of 20 percent, half of which live several times </p>
<p>above subsistence and the other half at or near subsistence. Horrell 2004:367, is similar.</p>
<p>43. On the inscription, see Kent 1966:99–100. Friesen 2010:231–256, argues that </p>
<p>οἰκονόμος involves a slave’s role and neither refers to the Latin quaestor nor the aedile. </p>
<p>(Dierently, Goodrich argues for the quaestor position: “the civic treasury magistrate”: </p>
<p>2012:199; cf. 62–65). It is not clear that this inscription was made at the time of the </p>
<p>biblical Erastus, and the full inscription may have possessed a dierent name prior to </p>
<p>its fragmentation: [Ep]erastus. See also Meggitt 1996:218–23.</p>

<p>45. Meat from the popinae, which the poor may aord, is not the same meat (see </p>
<p>eissen 2003:82–85).</p>
