<p>On the way, he quarrels with a man on the road and kills him, not know-</p>
<p>ing it is his father Laius. Aer delivering the ebans from the monstrous </p>
<p>Sphynx, the people make Oedipus their king and marry him to the widowed </p>
<p>Queen Jacosta, who is secretly his mother. e prophet Tiresias reveals </p>
<p>Oedipus as the king’s murderer and predicts calamity. Eventually, aer the </p>
<p>incestuous couple nds out the truth, Jacosta hangs herself and Oedipus </p>
<p>blinds himself with his mother’s brooches (Sophocles, Oed. Rex).</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>A nal myth we will mention is the tragedy of Medea. Being warned </p>
<p>by prophecy against his nephew Jason, Pelias, the usurper of Iolcus, sends </p>
<p>him with the Argonauts to retrieve a golden eece in Colchis. Aphrodite and </p>
<p>Cupid protect Jason by having Medea, daughter of King Aeetes of Colchis, </p>
<p>fall in love with Jason. With the help of Medea’s magic Jason accomplishes </p>
<p>great feats and takes the eece from Aeetes. e king chases them by ship, </p>
<p>and Medea cuts up her brother, inging occasional pieces into the sea to slow </p>
<p>down Aeetes, who must give his son a proper burial. e couple escapes, and </p>
<p>Jason delivers the eece to Pelias but nds out that his uncle was respon-</p>
<p>sible for his family’s death. So Medea tricks Pelias’s daughters into cutting up </p>
<p>and boiling the pieces of their father in a cauldron, believing Medea’s magic </p>
<p>could bring him back younger than before. Of course, she doesn’t do this and </p>
<p>ees with Jason to Corinth.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>In Corinth, Jason marries Glauke, King Kreon’s</p>
<p>daughter. is betrayal to Medea prompts her to give a “gi” of a crown and </p>
<p>dress to Glauke. As Glauke puts these on, she burns up along with her father, </p>
<p>and Medea kills her own children from Jason to get back at him as she es-</p>
<p>capes to Athens. e fountain of Glauke was reportedly where the princess </p>
<p>jumped into the water in an attempt to save herself from Medea’s deadly gi.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e fountain, like the Peirene, prompted Corinthians in the Roman age to </p>
<p>remember its famed Greek past with these stories.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Clearly, these myths center on conict, tragedy, honor, love, and a pre-</p>
<p>ponderance with death, oen brutal, along with the hope of immortality. </p>
<p>Moreover, prophecy and fate are well-respected—predictions come to pass </p>
<p>even when humans attempt to thwart them. Corinth’s inhabitants would be </p>
<p>daily reminded of these stories when seeing statues, paintings, sanctuaries, </p>
<p>coins, and inscriptions that inundated their city. ese myths prepare them </p>
<p>to ponder on death and the aerlife (cf. 1 Cor 15), while at the same time </p>
<p>prompt them to respect the words of wise orators and prophets (cf. chs. 1–4; </p>
