<p> “Now these things by way of type . . . ” (10:11)</p>
<p>Paul opens with the formulaic, I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers </p>
<p>and sisters, which has a hint of irony since he is addressing members who </p>
<p>are prideful of their knowledge.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>is congregation already knew the basic</p>
<p>exodus-wilderness episode (5:5–7), but what they may not have known is </p>
how this episode pertains to them in relation to divine judgment. Paul seems
<p>to be creating a new storyline by stringing together references from several </p>
<p>sources through catch words.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> Paul uses familial language to invite his pre-</p>
<p>dominantly Gentile audience to review Israel’s wilderness generation as our </p>
<p>fathers.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>e language assumes his converts have joined God’s elect people</p>
<p>and benet from their promises (Gal 3:6–9, 27–29; Rom 11:17–26). All the </p>
wilderness people underwent baptism into Moses in the cloud of divine
<p>presence and in the Red sea (see Exod 13:21–22; 14:21–24; Ps 78:13–14).</p>
<p>107</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul’s insertion of baptism into Moses prompts the congregation to recall </p>
<p>their own conversion. As Israel’s deliverance transpired through Moses in </p>
<p>the cloud and sea, so the Corinthians’ salvation took place in the name of Je-</p>
<p>sus and through baptism in the Spirit and water (1:13–17; 12:13; Rom 6:3). </p>
Paul’s connection between God’s Spirit and the cloud of divine presence is
<p>informed by traditions such as Num 11:16–30, where the cloud Presence </p>
<p>delegates the Spirit to Moses and among the elders who begin to prophesy.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>e spiritual food and drink all the Israelites consume in the wil-</p>
<p>derness recalls foremost their wilderness experience of eating manna and </p>
<p>drinking water from the rock (Exod 16:1–17:7; Num 20:1–13; 21:16–18). </p>
<p>To these elements Paul attaches the multifaceted word “spiritual” to con-</p>
<p>vey the miraculous and that which has, transmits, or originates from the </p>
divine presence. e rhetorical eect of this word intimates foremost the
<p>Corinthians’ unied participation in the Lord’s Supper (see 10:16–17). If </p>
<p>they experience spiritual benets and communion with God and Christ via </p>
<p>this food, their predecessors likewise experienced similar things. Moreover, </p>
<p>if the Corinthians claim to belong to Christ, they should consider that their </p>
<p>forefathers in the wilderness were drinking from the spiritual rock that </p>
<p>104. See also 12:1; Starling 2014:275.</p>
<p>105. On the midrash devises and gezerah shavah used in this passage, see Baron/</p>

<p>106. “Our fathers” is adopted from wilderness traditions (Num 20:15; cf. Ps 78:3–5; </p>
<p>Neh 9:9–34).</p>
<p>107. I prefer Greek manuscripts that use the middle voice ἐβαπτίσαντο (“they un-</p>
<p>derwent baptism”/“let themselves be baptized”) over the passive ἐβαπτίσθησαν (“they </p>
<p>were baptized”); the former is the harder reading and emphasizes Israel’s choice (Oro-</p>
<p>peza 2007:77–78).</p>
<p>108. See also Isa 63:7–14; Ps 106[105]:32–33; Luzarraga 1973:234–39.</p>
