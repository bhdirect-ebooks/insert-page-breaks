<p>Solidarity in Belief of the Resurrection: Fih Supporting Proof (1(:1–(8) </p>
<p>199</p>
<p>e second statement, and that he was buried, conrms that Christ </p>
<p>died, which stands as the prerequisite for resurrection. e burial assumes </p>
<p>that the dead body of Jesus was laid in a tomb and then vacated it aer he </p>
<p>rose again. ere is no reason to deny that this is what our apostle meant by </p>
<p>burial even if he does not technically use the phrase “empty tomb” as con-</p>
<p>ceptualized from the Gospels.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Like Paul, later proclamations and creeds</p>
<p>normally did not include any explicit mention of the empty tomb either; and </p>
<p>yet these same sources make explicit mention of the resurrection of esh.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is suggests that the empty tomb was mostly conned to full narratives, </p>
<p>such as found in the Gospels, rather than brief confessional formulae that </p>
<p>we nd here. For the Corinthians, Paul’s mention of Christ’s burial would be </p>
<p>sucient to assume an empty tomb or grave site, since they were almost cer-</p>
<p>tainly familiar with longer narratives about his resurrection that included </p>
<p>his body evacuating the burial site. If Christ’s burial is to be understood </p>
<p>“according to the scriptures,” then perhaps texts such as Isa 53:9–11 and Ps </p>
<p>16:8–11 are assumed.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Psalm 16 is especially relevant since the psalmist</p>
<p>speaks of the body not seeing corruption in the grave, and this reference </p>
<p>characterizes early apostolic proclamations about the resurrection, inclusive </p>
<p>of Paul’s proclamation (Acts 2:24–32; 13:34–37).</p>
<p>e third confession is that aer Jesus’s death and burial, he was </p>
<p>raised . . . according to the scriptures. is belief resonates with Jewish </p>
<p>traditions anticipating the human body raised to life aer death (Dan </p>
<p>12:1–3; Ezek 37:1–14; Isa 26:19; 2 Macc 7:10–11, 14; 1 En. 22:13; T. Benj. </p>
<p>10.6–9). e resurrection of Christ is the pivotal moment in Paul’s history </p>
<p>that conrms the arrival of the new era and assures the future resurrec-</p>
<p>tion of believers.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Christ rising on the third day is adopted from apostolic</p>
<p>tradition as well as being in accordance with scriptures. Hosea 6:2 speaks </p>
<p>of an anticipated restoration that includes God raising up his people on </p>
<p>the third day. Perhaps Paul read this verse in a way similar to the Targum </p>
<p>of Pseudo-Jonathan that associates this verse with resurrection from dead. </p>
<p>Another referent may include Jonah being three days in the sh, which is </p>
<p>said to be a sign related to Christ’s death and resurrection (Jon 1:17[2:1]; </p>
<p>cf. Matt 12:38–40; 16:4). Perhaps more relevant for Paul is Lev 23:1–16 in </p>
<p>which the rstfruits of the harvest is oered on the “day aer the Sabbath” </p>
<p>13. See Hengel 2001:120–83; Eriksson 1998:93; Lehmann 1968:78–86.</p>
<p>14. e.g., Acts 10:36–41; 17:31; 1 Pet 3:18–22; Ignatius Smyr. 1.1–2; Trall. 9; Justin </p>
<p>Apol. 1.21.1; Old Roman Creed c. 175 CE; Ware 2014b:480–81.</p>
<p>15. On the former, see Hous 2004:177–80. </p>
<p>16. e semantic range for ἐγείρω (to “rise,” “get up”) doesn’t include the idea of </p>
<p>elevation or ascension (Ware 2014b:494–95; cf. 487); i.e., Jesus rose in his own body </p>
<p>rather than was merely assumed into heaven without his earthly body.</p>
