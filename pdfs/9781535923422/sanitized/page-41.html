<p>Prothesis and Statement of Facts (1:10–17)</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Paul then discloses how he has presented himself as a paradigm to imitate in </p>
<p>order to end these allegiances (4:6–21).</p>
<p>Appeal to Unity (1:10)</p>
<p>e exhortative, I appeal to you, forms an inclusio with 4:16, which suggests </p>
<p>that the rst four chapters function as a unit with this same theme.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>When</p>
<p>the apostle makes strong urges he oen addresses recipients as brothers </p>
<p>and sisters (1:10; 16:15; Rom 12:1; 1 ess 4:10; 5:14). is designation </p>
<p>oen identies the beginning of a new topic or pericope in this letter (2:1; </p>
<p>3:1; 4:6; 10:1; 12:1; 14:6; 15:1). Such familial language exhibits Paul’s solidar-</p>
<p>ity with them so as to make what he insists on more attractive.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>It likewise</p>
<p>evokes pathos; the recipients get the impression that family members are </p>
<p>to be aectionate with one another, and to live in agreement.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Although</p>
<p>familial language is informal and compatible with private letters, Paul’s ap-</p>
<p>peal by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ gives the letter a formal ring </p>
<p>found in public and ocial letters.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Paul speaks as Christ’s representative,</p>
<p>as though Christ himself were present and making the appeal.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>e letter,</p>
<p>then, portrays Paul with the blended imagery of a family member and po-</p>
<p>litical delegate, and his message is both aectionate yet authoritative. </p>
<p>He challenges them to strive for agreement by speaking the same thing </p>
<p>regarding the issues he will address. ey are to be restored to a condition </p>
<p>they originally had when united in the same mindset and opinion.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>His</p>
<p>appeal invites them to recall their solidarity as one body in Christ aer their </p>
<p>conversion, a thought that naturally leads to a discussion about baptism in </p>
<p>1:13–17. At the same time, this exhortation aims to prohibit schisms from </p>
<p>continuing among them. e idea of unity in the face of schism nds special </p>
<p>relevance in the type of strife and quarreling typical of rhetorical students </p>
<p>competing against one another (see on 1:17; 3:1–3). It is also found in po-</p>
<p>4. e appeal, παρακαλῶ, commonly appears in deliberative rhetoric, whether in </p>
<p>oratory or epistolary form (e.g., Isocrates Or. 5.13.114; Ep. 1.5; Demosthenes Ep. 1.10; </p>
<p>Mitchell 1991:44 ).</p>
<p>5. See Trebilco 2012:26.</p>
<p>6. Cf. Plutarch Frat. amor. 2.1[478D–479B]; Collins 1999:71.</p>
<p>7. Likewise, παρακαλῶ is found both in ocial (Schnabel 2006:85) and private let-</p>
<p>ters (Arzt-Grabner et al. 2006:58).</p>
<p>8. Cf. Steyn 1996:484. </p>
<p>9. To be restored (κατηρτισμένοι; see LSJ 910) is variously rendered “be made </p>
<p>complete” (NASB), “be perfectly joined together” (AV), “be refurbished” (Garland </p>
<p>2003:40). e idea of restoration, of xing what is broken, dislocated, or torn (σχίσμα </p>
<p>can refer to a ri or tear) best ts the idea of a fragmented corporate body.</p>
