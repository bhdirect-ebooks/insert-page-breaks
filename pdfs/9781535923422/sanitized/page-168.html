<p>Augustus and Nero in their city depicted in pious gesture with head cover-</p>
<p>ings.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> e toga likewise is emblematic of high Roman status and elitism.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>certain male congregants wore the draped toga over their heads when wor-</p>
<p>shipping, this would exhibit before other members their prominent social </p>
<p>status, and perhaps draw much attention to themselves. In addition, if such </p>
<p>coverings signaled respect for other deities, then Paul, having just discussed </p>
<p>idolatry, might be prompted to present a viable alternative.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Our apostle</p>
<p>perhaps subverts the famous tale from Virgil with the story from Genesis, </p>
<p>as we notice below. </p>
<p>More immediately he claims that such a covering brings dishonor to </p>
<p>the man’s head, which may be understood either as Christ, or the man’s own </p>
<p>head (a synecdoche for the man’s own body and person), or both. If to his </p>
<p>own head, this dishonor may be understood by Paul in relation to confusion </p>
<p>of gender protocol. A head covering, something women normally wear, takes </p>
<p>away from male distinctiveness, and since gender identity is something God </p>
<p>has decreed,</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>dishonor is attributed to the man who covers himself like a</p>
<p>woman. If dishonor is to Christ as the man’s head, the man’s toga tends to </p>
<p>bring honor to himself rather than Christ,</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>and as such, this head covering</p>
<p>dishonors Christ. iselton distills the problem more thoroughly as “that </p>
<p>which distracts attention from God or Christ in public worship by generat-</p>
<p>ing a discordant, semiotic clothing code or hairstyle code which inevitably </p>
<p>draws attention to the self in a way which makes the person’s head a source </p>
<p>of shame for his or her own self-respect, the respect of congregation, and </p>
<p>the honor of the Lord who in public worship should be the central focus of </p>
<p>thought and attention . . . it constitutes attention-seeking behaviour which </p>
<p>thereby dishonor God and shames the self.”</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Similarly, every woman who prays or prophesies with her head un-</p>
<p>covered dishonors her head, namely, her husband and perhaps her own </p>
<p>person also. e woman is married (though Paul will include all women as </p>
<p>the text unfolds), and it is almost as though her head covering were sym-</p>
<p>bolic of a wedding ring; with it on she is protected from invasion and pen-</p>
<p>etration.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Incidentally, the assumed covering is probably not her long hair,</p>
