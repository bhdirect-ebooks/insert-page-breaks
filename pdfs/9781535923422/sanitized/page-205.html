<p>productive to a congregation in one small sentence, so long as that sentence </p>
<p>is intelligible, is more benecial than unintelligible tongues.</p>
<p>Tongues and Prophecy for Believers </p>
<p>and Unbelievers (14:20–25)</p>
<p>Now that Paul has provided the rationale for their desiring prophecy over </p>
<p>tongues, he reinforces it with Scripture and two situations related to assem-</p>
<p>bling together—one hypothetical situation in which uninterpreted tongues </p>
<p>is disadvantageous, and one ideal situation in which prophesy is advanta-</p>
<p>geous.</p>
<p>213</p>
<p>is unit opens with the designation, brothers and sisters, and</p>
<p>charges them with three imperatives: be not children in things pertaining </p>
<p>to understanding, but in reference to evil be babes; in things pertaining </p>
<p>to understanding, be mature adults.</p>
<p>214</p>
<p>Earlier contrasts between mature</p>
<p>and immature centered on wisdom (2:6; 3:1), but here it centers on orderly </p>
<p>worship. He relates tongues to what is written in Scripture, identied as the </p>
<p>Law to reinforce its authority.</p>
<p>215</p>
<p> He loosely cites or paraphrases Isa 28:11–</p>
<p>12: “With other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people, and not </p>
<p>even this way will they listen to me, says the Lord.” is quote does not </p>
<p>follow closely extant Hebrew or Greek versions of this text:</p>
<p>216</p>
<p>For with stammering lip and another tongue he will speak to </p>
<p>this people . . . and they were not willing to hear. (MT)</p>
<p>Because of contempt of lips, through another tongue, because </p>
<p>they will speak to this people . . . and they did not want to hear. </p>
<p>(LXX)</p>
<p>217</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even though Paul normally cites from the Greek text, on the balance, his </p>
<p>words follow the MT more than LXX here.</p>
<p>218</p>
<p>Our apostle may have been</p>
<p>contextually attracted to this text because he interpreted the cornerstone </p>
<p>213. See Gillespie 1994:161.</p>
<p>214. Paul’s mention of children seems informed by Isa 28:7–12, though he inter-</p>
<p>prets the text dierently (see below).</p>
<p>215. Sometimes “Law,” as here, refers to Scripture as a whole rather than only the </p>
<p>Pentateuch (Rom 3:19; John 10:34). </p>
<p>216. If Paul follows Aquila’s translation (Origen Philocalia 9.2; Wilk 2005:142), the </p>
<p>text is unavailable.</p>
<p>217. Paul has “I will speak,” whereas the MT has “he will speak,” and the LXX, “they </p>
<p>will speak.” He also omits a portion of Isa 28:12 as not relevant to his point on tongues. </p>
