<p>First Supporting Proof (1:18—4:21)</p>

<p>happiness includes, “noble birth . . . wealth . . . health, beauty, strength, stat-</p>
<p>ure . . . glory (reputation), honor, good luck, virtue” (Rhet. 1.5.4).</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>To Paul’s frustration, high regard for status and sophistry seems to </p>
<p>reect some of the Corinthians’ own sentiments despite many of them </p>
<p>originating from the lower class. ey seem to desire pandering to the wise, </p>
<p>eloquent, and elite of the world. ey mirror behavior more appropriate for </p>
<p>outsiders and adopt its ideology of prestige. Paul undermines this way of </p>
<p>thinking by insisting that not only does God frequently bypass those whom </p>
<p>society deems honorable but God utterly confounds their entire honor and </p>
<p>status-based ranking system.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> ey are put to shame, not merely in a psy-</p>
<p>chological sense but eschatological.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> ese words may echo prophetic tra-</p>
<p>ditions that declare God’s judgment against those who place all their trust in </p>
<p>human wisdom (Isa 30:3, 5; Jer 8:9; 9:22–23).</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>In their pursuit of status-seeking the Corinthians perhaps bragged </p>
<p>about their respective leaders and themselves in relation to those leaders </p>
<p>(1:12; 3:3–4, 21).</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> Paul subverts this boasting by maintaining that all believ-</p>
<p>ers receive a new status in Christ. eir boasts should not be centered on </p>
<p>pride and self-achievements but in the Lord (1:29, 31). e apostle para-</p>
<p>phrases Jeremiah where the Lord declares that the wise should not boast </p>
<p>in their own wisdom, the strong should not boast in their strength, and </p>
<p>the wealthy should not boast in their wealth. ey rather should all boast </p>
<p>in knowing the Lord who is merciful, just, and righteous (Jer 9:22–24).</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> </p>
Because Israel and its leaders had turned away from divine reliance and
<p>trusted in their own wisdom, strength, and wealth, they faced impending </p>
<p>judgment and their wise men would be put to shame (Jer 8:8 –11; 9:12; 10:7; </p>
<p>cf. 5:26–29; 17:5, 11; 23:10).</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>In this situation, Jeremiah tries to bring them</p>
<p>back to God as the true source of wisdom. Paul, informed by this prophetic-</p>
<p>wisdom discourse, redirects his audience to focus on God as the source of </p>
<p>all benets. ey should boast in the Lord instead of taking pride in human </p>

<p>32. Similarly, Barclay 2015:5.</p>
<p>33. Cf. Garland 2003:76–77. On shame as judgment, see Mark 8:38; Matt 10:38–42; </p>
<p>Luke 9:26; 1 John 2:28.</p>
<p>34. Inkelaar 2011:212, perceptively adds that those with renewed worship and faith </p>
<p>in the foundation stone, which Paul interprets as Christ, will not be put to shame (Isa </p>
<p>29:16–23 cf. Rom 9:33; 10:11).</p>
<p>35. is was nothing new in a city whose people were famous for making empty </p>
<p>boasts of their founder as the son of Zeus: see Introduction. </p>
<p>36. See also 1 Sam[Kgdms]2:10, though Inkelaar 2011:220–22, shows that Jeremi-</p>
<p>ah’s text reects Paul better.</p>
