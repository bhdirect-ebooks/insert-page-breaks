<p>Excursus: Paul’s Rhetoric against the Sophist Deliveries</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>845D; Theon, Prog. 3.[5]104).</p>

<p> To impress audiences, orators had to com-</p>
<p>mand an appealing appearance and dress and perform well when speaking. </p>
<p>The sophists excelled in theatrical qualities.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>Thucydides has the Athenian</p>
<p>warrior Cleon bemoaning Athenian susceptibility to eloquent speeches, be-</p>
<p>ing persuaded by their eyes and ears instead of facts. He calls them dupes </p>
<p>and “worshippers of every new extravagance” left at the mercy of their own </p>
<p>ears “like spectators attending a performance of sophists” (Hist. 3.38.2–7). </p>
<p>A conﬁdent look, pleasant tone of voice, a radiant smile, animated gestures </p>
<p>such as striking one’s thigh or stomping one’s foot at climactic moments </p>
<p>in one’s speech are some descriptors of delivery (Philostratus Vit. soph. </p>
<p>1.519–20; 537).</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>The sophist Herodes Atticus is described as having</p>
<p>grace, beauty, urbane wit, pleasing diction, a smooth tone, and eloquence </p>
<p>“like gold dust shining beneath the waters of a silvery eddying river” </p>
<p>(2.564). Even philosophers might be admired for having similar qualities. </p>
<p>Given the stoic allusions in the letter (e.g., 1 Cor 6:12–13), the wisdom </p>
<p>Paul comes against may extend beyond sophists. Pliny the Younger lauds </p>
<p>the Stoic Euphrates who marshals respect and speaks with well-chosen </p>
<p>words and “special charm which can captivate and so convince the most </p>
<p>reluctant listener. He is moreover tall and distinguished to look at, with long </p>
<p>hair and a ﬂowing white beard. . . . His dress is always neat, and his serious </p>
<p>manner makes no show of austerity, so that your ﬁrst reaction on meeting </p>
<p>him would be admiration rather than repulsion” (Ep. 1.10).</p>
<p>A combination of pleasant appearance and eloquence also marked out </p>
<p>orators to be educated and of prominent status, like elitists or even deities. </p>
<p>Alexander the sophist reportedly possessed a “godlike appearance,” curly </p>
<p>hair, large eyes, a stately nose, white teeth, and long slender ﬁngers “well </p>
<p>ﬁtted to hold the reins of eloquence” (Philostratus Vit. soph. 2.570). More </p>
<p>relevant for ﬁrst-century Corinthians was Favorinus who possessed smooth </p>
<p>skin, spoke with charm, beautiful eloquence, fascinating tones and rhythms </p>
<p>in his speech that enthralled even Romans unfamiliar with Greek (Philos-</p>
<p>tratus Vit. soph. 1.489, 491). The Corinthians, enamored by this sophist, </p>
<p>built a statue in his honor before he fell into disfavor (Dio Chrysostom, Or. </p>
<p>37). Sophists, normally coming from high ranking backgrounds, were also </p>
<p>associated with wealth and social eminence (Philo, Det 33–35; Aristides, </p>
<p>60. Kennedy 2003:22.</p>
<p>61. Or “scenic eects”: cf. σκηνή in Philostratus (tr. Wright 1998:120–21, 574). </p>
