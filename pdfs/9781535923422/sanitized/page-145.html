<p>a matter of love in the sense of giving up one’s own preferences,” as in the </p>
<p>Christ hymn of becoming a servant and dying on the cross for humankind’s </p>
<p>sake (Phil 2:5–11).</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>Paul wants to imitate Christ who, motivated by love,</p>
<p>selessly gave up his own privileges for the sake of saving others, a pattern </p>
<p>Paul aspires the Corinthian strong to mimic regarding idol foods and their </p>
<p>indierence toward weaker believers.</p>
<p>Paul accommodates four groups. He says of the rst group, To the Jews </p>
<p>I became as a Jew so that I might gain Jews. ese words are problematic </p>
<p>since Paul, a Jew, claims, “I became as a Jew” (ἐγενόμην . . . ὡς Ἰουδαῖος), </p>
<p>and this might suggest that he distances himself from Jewish identity.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>elsewhere he takes pride in being Jewish (Rom 9:1–4; 11:1). Perhaps he dis-</p>
<p>tinguishes between formative Judaism as a religion shaped by Mosaic Law </p>
<p>and having its cultic center in Jerusalem, and his ethnic heritage as a Jew (Gal </p>
<p>1:13–14; Phil 3:4–9). He does not appear to be Torah-abiding when relativiz-</p>
<p>ing circumcision (7:18–19; cf. Gal 5:1–4) and food laws (8:8; cf. Rom 14:14).</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nevertheless, beyond observing the Law, we wonder whether Paul consid-</p>
<p>ers his identity in Christ to be transcending cultural and ethnic identities so </p>
<p>that, for him, to belong to the new creation is to start setting aside one’s old </p>
<p>creation ties (1 Cor 10:32; 12:13; Gal 3:28; 6:16; 2 Cor 5:17; Col 3:11).</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>any case, for Paul to be “as a Jew” suggests his adaptation of religious, cultic, </p>
<p>and cultural language and certain practices when with other Jews who are </p>
<p>not in Christ. Similarly in Acts, his attending synagogues and circumcising </p>
<p>Timothy are for the sake of evangelism (e.g., Acts 13:14; 14:1; 16:1–3).</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A second group identies those who are under the Law of Moses, </p>
<p>which seem to be distinguished from the Jews just mentioned. is group </p>
<p>probably does not refer to Christian Jews, such as James and Peter, since he </p>
<p>would consider them already saved (15:1–7), and those he considers “false </p>
<p>brethren” he does not attempt to accommodate (Gal 2:3–5). Nor does he </p>
<p>seem to refer to those who hold to a stricter form of the Law, such as the </p>
<p>Pharisees.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>More likely, Paul refers to non-Christian Gentile proselytes to</p>
<p>Judaism and “god fearers,” similar to the type Acts portrays him encounter-</p>
<p>ing on his missions (e.g., Acts 13:42–48). </p>

<p>74. If he held to such observances this would seem to disrupt his fellowship with </p>
