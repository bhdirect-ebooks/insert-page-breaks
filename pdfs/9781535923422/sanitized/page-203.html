<p>clear and intelligible speech, how will it be known what is spoken? ough </p>
<p>they may be speaking to God, for others it is as though they are speaking </p>
<p>into the air—their voices serve no purpose. </p>
<p>His word-play on many kinds of sounds in the world, and none is </p>
<p>without sound (φωνῶν . . . ἄφωνον) is inclusive of but not limited to human </p>
<p>languages. ese words may evoke sounds in the city, and perhaps Paul’s </p>
<p>recollection of noises he heard at his workshop in Corinth. ese include </p>
<p>the sounds of workers, vendors, haggling, yelling, Greek, Latin, Aramaic, </p>
<p>sophists preaching, drunks singing, children playing and screaming, others </p>
<p>crying, and musical instruments in the background.</p>

<p> e force or signi-</p>
<p>cance of those sounds, which are all meaningful in their own right, must </p>
<p>be recognized and understood by hearers or else, as Paul asserts, I will be </p>
<p>a barbarian to the speaker, and the speaker a barbarian to me. is indi-</p>
<p>vidual characterizes the foreigner from the outskirts of Roman civilization. </p>
<p>If a barbarian were in town, his native language would rarely be known (e.g., </p>
<p>Ovid Tristia 5.10.37; Herodotus Hist. 2.57).</p>
<p>203</p>
<p>Tongues, like the barbarian’s</p>
<p>language imagined by Paul, are incomprehensible to those who hear them. </p>
<p>Since the Corinthians desire the manifestation of spiritual realities,</p>
<p>204</p>
<p>they</p>
<p>should desire to excel for the edication of the church—those who speak </p>
<p>in a tongue should pray for the ability to interpret it.</p>
<p>205</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul continues that if he prays in tongues, my spirit prays but my </p>
<p>mind is unfruitful. Here the human mind (1:10; 2:16; 14:19) and human </p>
<p>spirit (2:11; 5:3–5; 7:34; 16:18) are contrasted. “My spirit” has Paul as pos-</p>
<p>sessor and therefore does not mean another spirit other than Paul’s own, </p>
<p>though the Holy Spirit communes with his spirit. e dichotomy between </p>
spirit and mind has little to do with irrational and rational; divine inspira-
<p>tion does not have to mean losing one’s reason or volition as though in a </p>
<p>trance or possessed (cf. 14:32).</p>
<p>206</p>
<p>When Paul’s spirit prays, his mind (i.e.,</p>

<p>203. Fitzmyer 2008:514.</p>
<p>204. Collins 1999:499. Dierently, Tibbs 2006:51–53, 236–42, in 14:12 interprets </p>
<p>the plural πνευμάτων as spirit beings to argue for good spirits possessing believers to </p>
<p>enable the tongues. It is not impossible to suggest that Paul’s term is borrowed from the </p>
<p>Corinthians and thus may reect their own assumption that angels (as spirits) enable </p>
<p>them to speak in tongues (cf. 13:1). Regardless, Paul assumes the one Spirit of God </p>
<p>distributes spiritual gis and empowers believers to operate in them (12:7, 11).</p>
<p>205. Contrast Zerhusen 1997:139–52; Riddlebarger 2013:377, 382–83, who argue </p>
<p>that the speaker knows the foreign language. But if so, there is no reason to pray for </p>
<p>an interpretation that is already supposedly known (see Garland 2003:584 fn. 12). </p>
<p>Tongues is an extra-natural “spiritual” ability having little to do with natural language </p>
<p>skills (14:1–2). See also comments in 12:10; 13:1; 14:2, 14–15, 27–28.</p>
