<p>of this passage, God’s primary concern is not for oxen but for our sake.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His argument is from lesser to greater (qal wahomer)—if oxen are permit-</p>
<p>ted to eat of their labor, how much more should humans?</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>He continues</p>
<p>in 9:10 to reinforce the previous citation in the form of a maxim-like state-</p>
<p>ment: Yes indeed, for our sake it was written (i.e., the content of the quote </p>
<p>from 9:9), because the one who plows ought to plow in hope, and the one </p>
<p>who threshes (to thresh) in hope of sharing (the harvest).</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>e quote</p>
<p>and its explanation Paul makes relevant to his auditors by two follow-up </p>
<p>questions. If apostolic laborers like Paul and Barnabas have sown spiritual </p>
<p>benets to the Corinthians, is it such an extraordinary thing that they be </p>
<p>entitled to reap eshly (material) benets for this labor? e expected </p>
<p>answer is “no” and sets up an implied armation for the second question. </p>
<p>Others had apparently visited them, such as Peter, and exercised their right </p>
<p>to be supported. If they, then how much more are apostles like Paul and </p>
<p>Barnabas, who are specially commissioned to Gentiles like the Corinthians </p>
<p>(Gal 2:7–9), deserving of this right?</p>
<p>e adversative but in 9:12b signals a strong turning point in the </p>
<p>argument. Despite their apostolic entitlement Paul and Barnabas have not </p>
<p>exercised this right. Instead, they endure all adverse circumstances—the </p>
<p>menial labor of tent making included (for Paul)—so that they may not </p>
<p>cause a hindrance to the gospel of Christ. Sometimes it is necessary to </p>
<p>compromise one’s freedom for the greater good (cf. Dio Chrysostom Or. </p>
<p>40.34; Philo Abr. 216).</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>In what sense might the gospel be hindered if</p>
<p>Paul were to imitate apostles who do exercise their right? A combination </p>
<p>of ve answers are probable. First, he might hinder certain “weak” persons </p>
<p>from being saved if he did not conform to becoming “weak” himself (9:22), </p>
<p>and this means among other things that he willingly associates with their </p>
<p>51. For Pauline communities, Scripture inclusive of Moses’s Law is authoritative </p>
<p>and instructive in so far as it is interpreted in light of the Christ event and new era it has </p>
<p>ushered in (10:6, 11; Rom 15:4; Gal 3:19–26).</p>
<p>52. Cf. Instone-Brewer 1992:554; Ciampa/Rosner 2010:404.</p>
<p>53. Paul is not citing a second scripture in 9:10, pace Stanley 1992:196–97; Heil </p>
<p>2005:125–26, and others; none are able to provide a convincing verse being cited. In </p>
<p>9:10 γάρ means “Yes indeed” (BDAG 190) and ὅτι (“because”/“that”) does not in-</p>
<p>troduce another quote but gives further explication of the quote already given (Smit </p>
<p>2000b:246–49). ere is no reason Paul should change to the aorist “it was written” </p>
<p>(ἐγράφη) in 9:10, unless he is pointing back to the content of the perfect “it is written” </p>
<p>(γέγραπται) from 9:9. He sometimes uses ἐγράφη to elaborate on the Scriptures he </p>
<p>referenced earlier, e.g., in 1 Cor 10:11 of 10:7–10, in Rom 4:23–24 of 4:22, and Rom </p>
<p>15:4 of 15:3.</p>
<p>54. Cf. Mitchell 1991:130–33.</p>
