<p>Fusing the Horizons: Women Speakers at Church</p>
<p>193</p>
<p>ﬁrst and has some sense of priority in this text, but the point derived from </p>
<p>Genesis is that “as Eve was deceived by the Serpent, so the women in the </p>
<p>Ephesian congregation are being deceived by the false teachers who are </p>
<p>inspired by Satan (cf. 1 Tim 4:1–3; 5:13–15).”</p>
<p>277</p>
<p>As long as the Ephesian</p>
<p>women are inﬂuenced by these teachers, they fulﬁll the hypothetical prerep-</p>
<p>resentation of Eve being deceived and leading Adam astray.</p>
<p>278</p>
<p>There is no</p>
<p>indication that because of the creation story, no woman under any circum-</p>
<p>stance in any church should ever be permitted to speak, teach, or lead men. </p>
<p>Our author was possibly incited to mention the creation story in order to </p>
<p>refute a false teaching that inﬂuenced the congregation.</p>
<p>279</p>
<p>Although the old</p>
<p>created order of the ﬁrstness of Adam is recognized, in Pauline thought this </p>
<p>order is passing away in light of the new creation in Christ that will eventu-</p>
<p>ally come to realize fully “nor male and female . . . in Christ” (Gal 3:28; </p>
<p>cf. 2 Cor 5:17). Consistent with the new creation model, Paul’s churches </p>
<p>enable and endorse women leaders such as Phoebe and Junia (Rom 16:1, </p>
<p>7), and teachers such as Prisca (1 Cor 16:19; Acts 18:26).</p>
<p>We know from Paul and the New Testament that women were permit-</p>
<p>ted to prophesy and speak under the Spirit’s inspiration (11:5; 14:26; cf. </p>
<p>Acts 21:8–9; Rev 2:20). This was perhaps encouraged because in the new </p>
<p>era of the Spirit’s outpouring, which is to continue until Christ returns, “your </p>
<p>daughters will prophesy” is to characterize the church era (Acts 2:17). This </p>
<p>is compatible with the Jewish roots of Christian faith, which endorsed wom-</p>
<p>en prophets such as Deborah, Huldah, and Anna (Judg 4–5; 2 Kgs 22:14; 2 </p>
<p>Chr 34:22; Luke 2:36–38).</p>
<p>280</p>
<p>Likewise, epigraphic evidence supports that</p>
<p>women had leadership roles in ancient synagogues,</p>
<p>281</p>
<p>and Jewish texts do</p>
<p>not preclude their participating in ancient synagogue worship.</p>
<p>282</p>
<p>It seems</p>
<p>that neither 14:34–35 nor 1 Tim 2:9–15 intend to claim that women of all </p>
<p>churches of all eras must not speak, prophesy, or teach adult males in the </p>
<p>churches. We add to this that, unlike the ancient patriarchal world, women </p>
<p>in our own era can receive the same biblical and theological education that </p>

<p>278. On prerepresentation, see 10:6.</p>
<p>279. Marshall 2004:442, 459–60, claims this false teaching centered on female supe-</p>
<p>riority over males.</p>
