<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>
<p>102</p>
<p>though he does attempt to persuade by questions with exhortory answers </p>
<p>(7:27; cf. 7:18, 21), ve repetitive expressions (anaphora) that use multiple </p>
<p>conjunctions (polysyndeton) (7:29–31), and the use of same sounding </p>
<p>words (paranomasia) (7:32–35).</p>
<p>175</p>
<p>Paul addresses both male and female virgins, a group distinct from </p>
<p>unmarried non-virgins (see 7:8).</p>
<p>176</p>
<p> e language of being bound and re-</p>
<p>leased is legal, suggesting the ratifying or breaking of a marriage contract, </p>
<p>respectively (7:27, 39; cf. 7:15).</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>But since virgins are being addressed,</p>
<p>these words identify someone who is engaged to be married. Betrothal can </p>
<p>be viewed as a binding contract (cf. Aulus Gellius Noct. att. 4.4; Philo Spec. </p>
<p>Leg. 3.12.72).</p>
<p>178</p>
<p>Paul advises that a betrothed believer does not need to end</p>
<p>the relationship, but if that person has recently ended one, such should </p>
<p>not seek another betrothal. If the latter decides to get betrothed again and </p>
<p>marry anyway, he or she has not done wrong by refusing to take Paul’s </p>
<p>advice. Paul is concerned, though, that new marriages will have trouble in </p>
<p>the esh. ese words suggest there are unique challenges of daily respon-</p>
<p>sibilities married couples face in relation to pleasing each other and also </p>
<p>earning enough money so as to feed, nurture, and protect their children. </p>
<p>Virgin believers only need to fend for themselves, and given the way things </p>
<p>are presently shaping themselves in Paul’s world, fewer responsibilities are </p>
<p>better. is trouble aside, Paul says regarding those who get married, I </p>
<p>spare you. In other words, “I desist from claiming that you must remain </p>
<p>virgins, and I will not consider you to be doing wrong for not following my </p>
<p>advice” (cf. 7:28a, 35–36).</p>
<p>Paul provides two major reasons why he encourages virgins to remain </p>
<p>in their present state. e rst centers on the present distress (7:26). Win-</p>
<p>ter posits that this relates to a grain and food shortage that aected Corinth </p>
<p>roughly around the 40s and 50s CE.</p>
<p>179</p>
<p>If so, perhaps Paul interprets this</p>
<p>calamity through an apocalyptic lens. In the Jesus traditions famine be-</p>
<p>longs to the beginning of “birth pangs” signaling the beginning of the end </p>
<p>175. I.e., ἀμέριμνος/“free from care”; μεριμνάω/“to care for”; μεμέρισται/“he is di-</p>
<p>vided” (ibid.).</p>
<p>176. On male virgins, see e.g., JosAsen 4.7, 8.1; Rev 14:4. </p>
<p>177. See Zeller 2010:260–61; Arzt-Grabner et al. 2006:292–93.</p>
<p>178. Cf. Schrage 1994:2.158.</p>
<p>179. Winter 2001:215–25; cf. e.g., Suetonius Claud 18.2; Tacitus Ann. 12.43.1;<span class="_ _1" /> In-</p>
<p>scription to Dinippus. Carter 2010:161–65, questions whether scarcity in such sources </p>
<p>caused “major social unrest” (even though he later supports Winter’s shortage for </p>
<p>interpreting 11:21–22 [172–73]). His alternative is that ἐνεστῶσαν ἀνάγκην in 7:26 </p>
<p>reects ἀνάγκη in 7:37 and is paraphrased, “the ever-present threat of sexual immoral-</p>
<p>ity” rather than “current distress.” I question whether the Corinthians would have rst </p>
<p>heard it this way without prior conditioning from 7:37.</p>
