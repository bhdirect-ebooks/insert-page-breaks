<p>Fusing the Horizons: Mingling with Vice-Doers Today</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>attempts by the church’s ministers to communicate privately with the of-</p>
<p>fending member in an effort to foster reconciliation. If such attempts are </p>
<p>unsuccessful, and the member remains recalcitrant, the ministers will need </p>
<p>to determine whether the offense is jeopardizing the physical, emotional, </p>
<p>and/or spiritual safety of other congregation members, and whether central </p>
<p>beliefs, practices, reputation, or integrity of the respective church might </p>
<p>be tarnished by the offense. Offenders will normally be asked to step down </p>
<p>from any leadership position in the congregation, and in some cases they </p>
<p>might be asked to leave the church.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>If such discipline seems distasteful,</p>
<p>it might be because we have misconstrued Christian love as unqualiﬁed ac-</p>
<p>ceptance, and tolerance has perhaps become a euphemism for indifference </p>
<p>and deﬁcient moral courage.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>In highly regulated communities reminiscent</p>
<p>of the earlier eras, societal pressures frequently gained the upper hand when </p>
<p>persuading an offender to conform to societal standards both on corporate </p>
and individual levels.
<p>45</p>
<p>The shunning of offenders in tight-knit cultures,</p>
<p>as well as in many ancient communities in Paul’s world, might succeed in </p>
<p>prompting offenders to reconsider their ways. Such communities, however, </p>
<p>are not normally what we ﬁnd in contemporary Western societies where </p>
independence and individual liberties are often valued far above church discipline. The remedial aim of corporate and individual shunning of such
<p>an offender would seem to be less successful for those who have few family </p>
<p>connections at church, and can easily join another community and attend </p>
<p>another church denomination.</p>
<p>If the decision against the offender in Corinth was a corporate affair </p>
involving the entire congregation, what does that mean on an individual
<p>level? In private and non-church settings, should we still follow Paul’s man-</p>
<p>date to not eat with such vice-doers? There are no easy answers. Mingling </p>
<p>of this sort is perhaps best discerned on a case-by-case basis. Each person </p>
<p>must prayerfully ask him- or herself questions such as these: What do I plan </p>
<p>to accomplish by maintaining this connection? What might biblically based </p>
<p>love, mercy, justice, prudence, and discipline have to say in reference to my </p>
<p>relationship with this person? Would my connection with this person com-</p>
<p>promise or threaten my own faith and values? Would my connection with </p>
<p>this person threaten another person’s faith and values? Could my or another </p>
<p>person’s physical and emotional well-being be jeopardized by this mingling? </p>
