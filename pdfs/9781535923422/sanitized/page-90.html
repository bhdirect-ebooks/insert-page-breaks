<p>Avoiding Sexual Delement: Second Supporting Proof ((:1—7:40) </p>

<p>7:4B).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> Since no judgment is mentioned in relation to this woman, she prob-</p>
<p>ably was not part of the congregation. Paul is generally correct when saying </p>
<p>that this kind of relationship was not practiced even among the Gentiles.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Among Greeks and Corinthians, Sophocles’ tragedy, Oedipus Rex, stig-</p>
<p>matized incest with King Oedipus blinding himself aer discovering he </p>
<p>married his mother.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Roman law condemned incestuous unions—a rule</p>
<p>from e Digest punishes extramarital incest with severity (48.39).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Winter</p>
<p>suggests that the incestuous man’s father was still alive, and so the man’s </p>
<p>oense combined incest and adultery, which would constitute a policy of no </p>
<p>leniency in Roman law.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>e Corinthians are pued up instead of mourning about this situ-</p>
<p>ation, which possibly means that they are boasting in liberties inclusive </p>
<p>of sexual freedom (cf. 6:12), or boasting in the man’s upper class status as </p>
<p>their patron, or boasting in a recent victory this man won in the court-</p>
<p>room against other church members wanting to have him punished by law.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another possibility is that Paul, having addressed Corinthian arrogance </p>
<p>already (4:6, 18), now presents this case as a way of bursting their bubble. </p>
<p>ey are not boasting because of the incest but despite it.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>A paraphrase of</p>
<p>Paul’s words highlights this irony: “Are you so inated that you don’t even </p>
<p>mind that there is incest in your congregation? Are you going to boast about </p>
<p>that, too, or be ashamed and confront this person?” If they had mourned </p>
<p>over the situation, they would recognize that this person’s aair is appall-</p>
<p>ing, and they would oppose him despite any inuence or social-economic </p>
<p>prominence he might have.</p>
<p>Paul claims that although he is absent in body from them, he is pres-</p>
<p>ent in spirit and has already determined to expel the wrongdoer. In what </p>
<p>sense might his spirit be present in Corinth when his body remains in Ephe-</p>
<p>sus? is peculiar notion might be explained as a letter topos in which the </p>
<p>3. Although Paul teaches a circumcision-free gospel to Gentiles, he still upholds </p>
<p>Mosaic Law regarding the condemnation of incest and fornication perhaps based on </p>
<p>the apostolic decision in Jerusalem (Acts 15:1–20).</p>
<p>4. ere are exceptions, however (see Paschke 2007:169–92), for example with </p>
<p>certain emperors (Suetonius Calig. 24.1; Claud. 39.2). But at least some of these rela-</p>
<p>tions might conrm the general sentiment against incest. Paul, at any rate, may be pre-</p>
<p>senting the general sentiment of his time as universal, or he uses a little bit of hyperbole.</p>
