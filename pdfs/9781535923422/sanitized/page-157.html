<p>e idea of cultic eating in the Lord’s presence then prompts rhetorical </p>
<p>questions relevant to the Corinthian situation—What then am I saying? </p>
<p>at a thing sacriced to an idol is anything, or is an idol anything? Paul </p>
<p>agrees with the strong members that idols are nothing (8:4); hence, the ex-</p>
<p>pected answer is “no,” which is quickly qualied: But the things which they </p>
<p>sacrice, they sacrice to demons and not to God. Gentile idolaters are </p>
<p>primarily in view.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>All the same Paul’s “they” may be deliberately vague</p>
<p>in order to evoke on another level the Corinthians’ “forefathers” (10:1). His </p>
<p>words allude to Israel’s past idolatry of sacricing to demons (Deut 32:17; cf. </p>
<p>Ps 106:36–37), which implicitly warns the Corinthians again not to follow </p>
<p>in the wilderness generation’s footsteps. ey should not be partners with </p>
<p>idolaters and participate in idolatrous meals (10:5–11). </p>
<p>For Paul, there may be a distinction between eating foods in an idol’s </p>
<p>temple, which the strong are not warned against (see 8:10), and participat-</p>
<p>ing with idolaters in their cultic sacrices that accompany eating idol foods.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e Corinthians are warned against the latter, which involves partnering </p>
<p>with demons. ese δαιμόνια appear to be malignant spirits understood by </p>
<p>Paul as angelic beings in league with Satan and existing since Israel’s ar-</p>
<p>chaic past (2 Cor 12:7; Rom 8:38; cf. Deut 32:17).</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>Paul confronted similar</p>
<p>spirits according to Acts 16:16–18 (cf. 19:11–12; 2 Cor 12:12; Rom 15:19). </p>
<p>As such, it is incompatible for the Corinthians to participate at the table </p>
<p>of the Lord (the Lord’s Supper) and participate at the table of demons.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although demons are not the actual deities whom idolaters intend to wor-</p>
<p>ship, Mody is right when arming that “the act of sacrice/worship/hom-</p>
<p>age of idols is the key act by which evil powers are related to idols and are </p>
able to co-opt or divert what is intended for idols so that the idolaters serve
<p>daimonia [demons] by coming into the sphere of power of evil powers.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p>136. In 10:20 τὰ ἔθνη (“the Gentiles”) is missing in some important manuscripts </p>
<p>(e.g., B, D) and is probably a gloss attempting to provide the verse with a subject </p>
<p>(Metzger/United Bible Societies 1994:494). Even so, the present tense “they sacrice” </p>
<p>(θύουσιν), altered from the aorist “they sacriced” (ἔθυσαν) alluded to in Deut 32:17, </p>
<p>suggests Gentile idolaters contemporary with Paul’s time are in the foreground. Con-</p>
<p>temporary Israelites in Jerusalem could hardly be meant if Christians still worshipped </p>
<p>at the temple. </p>
<p>137. See Newton 1998:198–99, 363–70; Horrell 1997:101, 103; Borgen 1995:56.</p>
<p>138. Hence, they are probably the same type of beings exorcized by Jesus and his </p>
<p>disciples (Luke 9:1; 11:14–21), and not, or at least not merely, the genius of the Roman </p>
<p>emperor, as Winter 2015:214–25, proposes.</p>
<p>139. Τράπεζα (“table”) can also mean “altar” (e.g., Mal 1:7, 12; Schrage 1994:2.446–</p>
<p>47). e “cup of demons” may refer to libation oerings: e.g., libations to Dionysius, </p>
<p>god of wine, who was known as “the Good Daimon” (Fotopoulos 2003:177).</p>
