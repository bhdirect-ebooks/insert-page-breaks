<p>Perseverance and Hope (2 Thess 2:1–17)</p>
<p>2 Thessalonians 2:1–17 </p>
<p>In the rst chapter of this letter, Paul oered a broader perspective on the </p>
<p>challenges that were facing the essalonians. He encouraged them to see </p>
<p>that their tenacious and intrepid delity to God and love for one another </p>
<p>was an inspiration to Silvanus, Timothy, and himself (1:1–3). Indeed, it </p>
<p>brought encouragement to other churches (1:4). Paul also explained that </p>
<p>they could live in the sure hope that God would ultimately aict the aic-</p>
<p>tors and relieve the aicted when the Lord Jesus returns in glory (1:5–10). </p>
<p>Paul rounded out chapter one with a wish-prayer that the essalonians </p>
<p>hold fast to their calling to endure for the glory of Jesus and by the grace of </p>
<p>God (1:11–12).</p>
<p>In the second chapter, Paul engages more specically with the matter </p>
<p>of “the coming of our Lord Messiah Jesus” and his concern that the es-</p>
<p>salonians not have their walk with Jesus thrown o balance in light of what </p>
<p>seems like recent events, circumstances, or information. In 2:1–12, Paul </p>
<p>engages in what appears to be his primary concern in this letter.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>ere are many details in this chapter that have caught the attention of </p>
<p>readers throughout the centuries—what is the “apostasy”? Who is the “Man </p>
<p>of Sin”? What is the “mystery of lawlessness”? Who or what is “the restrainer”? </p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are not in a good position to ascertain the referents to </p>
<p>these gures and terms; presumably the original readers were privy to this </p>
<p>information. Still, we must be careful not to get too lost amongst the “trees” </p>
<p>that we miss the “forest” of Paul’s wider concerns. It would seem that Paul </p>
<p>adumbrates eschatological events, not as a kind of apocalyptic calendar to </p>
<p>follow, but rather to underscore that despite a series of dark happenings </p>
<p>to come ultimately Messiah Jesus will prevail and his loyal people will be </p>
<p>vindicated. e central imperative of his eschatological discourse, then, is </p>
