Divine Sovereignty. Unfortunately, the language of “divine sov-
<p>ereignty” has sometimes been used to imply that God controls </p>
<p>everything with puppet strings. However, the more general use of </p>
<p>this phrase simply means that believers are expected to have full </p>
<p>condence that God has ultimate power over evil, and when he </p>
<p>promises to make things right, to rescue and redeem and renew, </p>
<p>we can rest assured that it will happen by his will. us, Paul can </p>
<p>write to the essalonians with a sense of boldness and sureness—</p>
<p>“we who are le alive at the coming of the Lord will absolutely not </p>
<p>go ahead of those who have ‘fallen asleep’” (4:15).</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>It is because of</p>
<p>the faithfulness of the all-powerful Father God and Messiah Jesus </p>
<p>that Paul can have such condence (1 ess 5:24).</p>
<p>Radical Transformation. Apocalypticists tend to have a keen sense </p>
<p>that what God intends to do in the future will change everything. </p>
<p>Paul already believed a major “change” happened with the rst </p>
<p>coming of Jesus (1 Cor 10:11; 2 Cor 5:17). However, Paul believed </p>
<p>that God was not yet nished with his redemptive work, and the </p>
<p>Parousia, the reappearance of Messiah Jesus, would complete his </p>
<p>plan to make all things like new. at sense of “radical transforma-</p>
<p>tion” is notable in 1 ess 4:17 where Paul claims, “And henceforth </p>
<p>we will be with the Lord forever.” at word “forever” (pantote) </p>
<p>is essential, because it means there is no going back, there is no </p>
<p>threat of disruption, corruption, or separation at the threat of any </p>
<p>hostile force. While pantote is technically a temporal word (“for </p>
<p>all time”), the force of what Paul is saying has to do more with </p>
<p>“unalterable togetherness.”</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Going back to Paul’s rhetorical purposes in chapter four, we can con-</p>
<p>textualize his apocalyptic discourse in view of comforting the essalonian </p>
<p>believers who remain alive. Again Paul, in contrast to pagan grief, sets his </p>
<p>converts’ eyes on a hope beyond the grave. Paul does not discourage or </p>
<p>dismiss grief. He simply wants believers to know the power and plan of </p>
<p>God. God intends to restore the Christian dead, and he will do it. rough </p>
<p>a “word of the Lord,” Paul goes on to reveal a glimpse of eschatological </p>
<p>events that are yet to unfold (4:15–17).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Paul seems to underscore that “the</p>
<p>14. e NET is one of the only translations I could nd that tries to capture the </p>
<p>rare Greek negative construction ou mē (with the subjunctive verb following), which </p>
<p>expresses absolute certainty that something will not happen (NET employs “surely”; </p>
<p>compare, similarly, CEB “denitely”).</p>
