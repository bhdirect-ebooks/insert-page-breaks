<p>associated with a synagogue (hence Acts 17:4). ey maintained an interest </p>
<p>in multiple gods, but also honored the god of Israel. Perhaps it was not </p>
<p>too long aer this interest that Paul introduced them to Messiah Jesus and </p>
<p>many of them came to believe Paul’s gospel. is situation would, indeed, </p>
<p>anger certain Jews in just such a way as we see in Acts 17 and also in 1 </p>
<p>ess 2:14–16, if symphyletēs refers to Jewish essalonian compatriots. </p>
<p>Paul could write that they had turned from idols to serve God because they </p>
<p>had not done so as god-fearers despite their prior interest in Israel’s god.</p>
<p>Excursus: Gentile Believers Incorporated into Israel’s Story through </p>
<p>Jesus </p>
<p>It is often pointed out that Paul does not quote the Old Testament (LXX) in </p>
<p>1 Thessalonians, and that this fact probably means that the Thessalonian </p>
<p>believers were Gentiles who did not know the Jewish Scriptures.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>That they</p>
<p>were mostly Gentiles is almost certain, but the assumption that Paul con-</p>
<p>sciously avoided quoting Scripture for that reason is hasty. First Thessalonians </p>
<p>is saturated with Old Testament imagery, motifs, expressions, and ideas. Paul </p>
<p>clearly crafts their identity in such a way as to draw them into the story and </p>
<p>even the identity of Israel. They are ekklēsia as the people of God (1:1). They </p>
<p>are beloved of God (1:4), as Israel is; they have been made precious to God </p>
<p>(1:4). They are recipients of Israel’s good news (1:5), the “word of the Lord” </p>
<p>sounded forth from them (1:8), they will be rescued from Yahweh’s wrath </p>
<p>(1:10). They are taught how to “walk” with God (4:1), to obey his will regard-</p>
<p>ing holy consecration (4:3, 7). They are identiﬁed as those separate from “the </p>
<p>Gentiles who do not know God” (4:5). They are true light (5:5), those destined </p>
<p>for salvation (5:9). If Paul was trying to communicate in a non-Jewish style, </p>
<p>he failed.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>While Paul did not feel the need to make explicit arguments from</p>
<p>Scripture, he was clearly drawing these Gentiles into the story and identity of </p>
<p>Israel through Messiah Jesus.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>It is possible that Jews from the synagogue where these Gentiles once </p>
<p>worshiped (as god-fearers) tried to maintain an ongoing relationship with them, </p>
<p>hoping to “win them back,” so to speak, even if through fear. Perhaps they </p>

<p>41. F. Matera argues much the same for how Paul identies the Philippian church; see </p>
