<p>Fusing the Horizons 5.1: A New Covenant Community of Love 87</p>
<p>their agency who plant and water from without but likewise by God </p>
<p>also who ministers in secret his own increase. All this is in such </p>
<p>a way that God not only exhibits truth but likewise imparts love. </p>
<p>. . . Thus the apostle speaks to the Thessalonians, “As touching </p>
<p>love of the brothers, you have no need that I write to you, for you </p>
<p>yourselves have been taught by God to love one another.” On the </p>
<p>Grace of Christ 12.13—13.14.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Augustine makes the point that, for the new covenant people, their “way” </p>
<p>must be unique at its core. These people do not simply receive written or </p>
<p>verbal teaching for intellectual consumption, but, rather, the instruction they </p>
<p>receive (even when through humans) is imbued with the presence and power </p>
<p>of the Holy Spirit itself. And the people are not simply informed by God, but </p>
<p>they are moved. This is why Paul can talk about the God who gives his Spirit </p>
<p>to the people (4:8). “Thus you will know them by their fruits” (Matt 7:20). As </p>
<p>we recognize the powerful work of God in us, his transformed people, may we </p>
<p>sing together a song of exhortation to love like this one.</p>
<p>Gracious Spirit, Holy Ghost</p>
<p>taught by you, we covet most,</p>
<p>of our gifts at Pentecost,</p>
<p>holy, heavenly love.</p>

<p>Living with Integrity (4:11–12)</p>
<p>In 4:11–12, Paul exhorts the essalonians to live quietly, manage their own </p>
<p>aairs, and work with their own two hands. roughout the whole letter, </p>
<p>Paul underscores the importance of work and labor (1:3; 2:9; 3:5; 5:12–13; </p>
<p>cf. 1 Cor 4:12). Despite the fact that he can refer to the importance of be-</p>
<p>ing ready for the return of Jesus (1 ess 5:6, 8), there is also the need for </p>
<p>faithfulness and integrity in everyday work, not least as a testimony to the </p>
<p>outside, unbelieving world that followers of Jesus are respectful, trustwor-</p>
<p>thy citizens and neighbors. Wherever need exists in the community, Paul </p>
<p>assumes that believing brothers and sisters will step in and oer support </p>
<p>(1 ess 5:14). However, where “grace” is the watchword, there is always </p>
<p>the temptation for some to exploit the kindness of others for their own </p>
<p>gain and to gratify their own laziness. Paul rejects this spirit of exploitative </p>
<p>dependence. is comes across clearly in Galatians as well. Each person is </p>
