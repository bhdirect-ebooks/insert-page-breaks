<p>Paul’s Love, Pride, and Concern (1 ess 2:17—3:13) 69</p>
<p>e essalonians’ Good News of Perseverance (3:1–10)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>erefore, when we could no longer bear it, we thought it best </p>
<p>to stay behind in Athens, </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>and we sent Timothy, our brother and </p>
<p>coworker for God in the good news of the Messiah. We sent him </p>
<p>to strengthen you and to encourage your loyalty, </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>so that no one </p>
<p>is shaken up by these aictions. For you know for yourselves that </p>
<p>this was inevitable. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>When we were with you, we kept telling you </p>
<p>that we would be persecuted—and so it came to pass as you know. </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>So then, when it became impossible for me to bear, I sent Timo-</p>
<p>thy to learn about your loyalty, fearing that the tempter may have </p>
<p>tempted you, and all our toil wasted.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>But now Timothy has come back to us from visiting you and </p>
<p>has announced to us the “good news” of your loyalty and love, and </p>
<p>that you always carry fond memories of us. He told us how you </p>
<p>long to see us just as we long to see you. </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>So we were comforted </p>
<p>about you, my dear brothers and sisters, in all of our distress and </p>
<p>suering since we were reassured about your loyalty. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>For now we </p>
<p>feel alive again, knowing you stand rm in the Lord. </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>In what way </p>
<p>can we thank God in return for you, for all the joy we feel in the </p>
<p>presence of God because of you? </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Night and day we pray fer-</p>
<p>vently that we may see your faces so that we may meet the needs </p>
<p>of your loyalty. </p>
<p>Starting in chapter three, Paul narrates his concern for the essalo-</p>
<p>nians while he was in Athens (3:1–12). Timothy, Paul’s close companion </p>
<p>and co-worker (see 1:1), was sent to check in on the essalonians and to </p>
<p>strengthen and comfort them during a dicult time (3:2).</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>He carried out</p>
<p>an important pastoral task, namely, “helping them both to understand and </p>
<p>to live out what it means to be members of God’s people.”</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Almost as an</p>
<p>aside, Paul reminds them that they were forewarned that true followers of </p>
<p>Jesus are bound to face persecution (3:3b). Paul communicates something </p>
<p>quite similar to the Philippians: “For he has graciously granted to you the </p>
<p>privilege not only of believing in him [Jesus], but of suering for him as </p>
<p>well” (1:29; cf. Rom 8:17). Believers inevitably will suer for their allegiance </p>
<p>to Jesus as Lord, not because God relishes in suering, but because the </p>
<p>11. Todd Still wonders whether the reason Timothy was the right choice for this </p>
<p>ministry was because he “was not ‘front and center’ during the founding visit and as a </p>
<p>result would not be on the ‘radar screen’ of non-Christian opposition.” See Still 2011: </p>
<p>30–45, at 33.</p>
