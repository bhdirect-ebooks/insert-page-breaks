<p>Mission and Community (2 ess 3:1–18)152</p>
<p>of the Lord through the Spirit (see 2 Cor 1:2–5). is reminds me of Jesus’ </p>
<p>words to his disciples in the Fourth Gospel: “Peace I leave with you; my </p>
<p>peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your </p>
<p>hearts be troubled, and do not let them be afraid” (John 14:27).</p>
<p>In Romans, Paul also happens to mention the “God of peace.” In </p>
<p>his concern for those who “cause dissensions and oenses” in opposition </p>
<p>to apostolic teaching, Paul calls the Romans to avoid troublemakers, for </p>
<p>“such people do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites, and </p>
<p>by smooth talk and attery they deceive the hearts of the simple-minded” </p>
<p>(16:17–18). Paul exhorts them towards vigilance and shrewdness. e time </p>
<p>is short because soon “the God of peace” will destroy the work of Satan </p>
<p>(Rom 16:20). Again, the point is that, despite the aictions of today, and </p>
<p>even tomorrow, ultimately the God of peace wins over evil, and those who </p>
<p>persevere to the end will nd rest and shalom.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Leadership and Work</p>
<p>Recently I had a conversation with a pastor about the future of ministry in the </p>
<p>United States. He is a church planter who also runs his own business. For </p>
<p>many pastors, it is less than ideal to be a tent-maker (having a non-ministry-</p>
<p>related income while also having a strong ministry vocation). Many desire to </p>
<p>free themselves up to focus entirely on the growth of their church or ministry. </p>
<p>There is much to commend this thought and biblical support as well. </p>
<p>According to Acts, apparently some widows were being neglected in the daily </p>
<p>food distribution of the church. The twelve apostles, while concerned for these </p>
<p>widows, thought it best to continue their primary work of teaching the Word </p>
<p>of God and praying, and they selected a group of seven men to see that </p>
<p>these widows received food (Acts 6:1–3). Paul himself mentions that the Lord </p>
<p>Jesus, apparently during his earthly ministry, made the provision that those </p>
<p>who preach the gospel should receive their living from this work (and not be </p>
<p>forced into other work for income; see 1 Cor 9:14). And yet, in 1 Corinthians </p>
<p>9 Paul goes on to explain that he has chosen to offer the gospel and not to be </p>
<p>dependent ﬁnancially on his churches (9:18). Also, in his relationship with </p>
<p>the Thessalonians, he wanted to serve as an example of one who “works for </p>
<p>his own bread” and also make sure he is above reproach in how he handles </p>
<p>money and wealth.</p>
