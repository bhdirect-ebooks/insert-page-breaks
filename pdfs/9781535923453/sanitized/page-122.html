<p>Final Instruction (1 Thess 5:12–28) </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Now we ask you, my dear brothers and sister, to acknowledge </p>
<p>those who are laboring among you, who guide you in the Lord, </p>
<p>and who admonish you. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Show them deep respect for their work </p>
<p>by your love. Live peacefully with each other. </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>And we urge you, </p>
<p>my dear brothers and sisters, admonish the idle, comfort the dis-</p>
<p>couraged, devote yourself to the weak; be patient with everyone. </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>See to it that no one pays back evil with evil; instead, always pur-</p>
<p>sue goodness both with each other and with everyone. </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Rejoice </p>
<p>always. </p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Pray all the time. </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Give thanks no matter the circum-</p>
<p>stance. is is God’s will in Messiah Jesus for you. </p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Do not put </p>
<p>out the Spirit’s re. </p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Do not disregard prophecies. </p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Instead, put </p>
<p>everything to the test: cling to what is good, </p>
<p>22</p>
<p>distance yourself </p>
<p>from whatever has even a hint of evil.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Now may the God of peace himself make you completely </p>
<p>holy, and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless </p>
<p>at the coming of our Lord Messiah Jesus. </p>
<p>24</p>
<p>e One who calls you </p>
<p>is faithful, and he will see it is done.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, pray for us. </p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Greet all your </p>
<p>brothers and sisters with a holy kiss. </p>
<p>27</p>
<p>I solemnly command you </p>
<p>in the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters. </p>
<p>28</p>
<p>e grace of our Lord Messiah Jesus be with you. </p>
<p>Paul has a tendency to conclude his letters with a series of nal instructions </p>
<p>and statements. When approaching these last words, we must be careful to </p>
<p>avoid two problematic approaches. First, it is not uncommon in popular </p>
<p>Christian devotionals to extract a snippet as a motto, such as “pray without </p>
<p>ceasing” (1 ess 5:17). No doubt, this is good advice from Paul overall, </p>
<p>but you will appreciate what he is writing on a far deeper level if you try to </p>
<p>make sense of these statements in their context. at leads to the second </p>
<p>tendency, a scholarly one. ere is a tradition of scholarship that treats the </p>
<p>cluster of Paul’s nal instructions as “generic.” at is, many interpreters </p>
<p>in the past assumed that what Paul says about “Do’s” and “Don’ts” have no </p>
<p>connection to specic concerns that Paul has for the essalonians.</p>
