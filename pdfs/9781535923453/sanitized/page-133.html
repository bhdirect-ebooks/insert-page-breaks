<p>anksgiving and Hope (2 ess 1:1–12) 121</p>
<p>with Hermas about the blessings and honor bestowed on martyrs: “all who </p>
<p>once suered for the name of the Lord are honorable before God; and all </p>
<p>these the sins were remitted, because they suered for the name of the Son </p>
<p>of God” (9.28.3). e angel goes on to explain that when these faithful be-</p>
<p>lievers were brought to trial, they did not renounce their faith, but “suered </p>
<p>cheerfully.”</p>
<p>us, “these are held in greater honor with God” in comparison to </p>
<p>those who succumbed to doubt (9.28.4). e angel warns Hermas that suf-</p>
<p>fering brings out either the weakness of doubt and lack of commitment to </p>
<p>Jesus, or it demonstrates the depth and genuineness of faith: “And ye who </p>
<p>suer for His name ought to glorify God, because He deemed you worthy </p>
<p>to bear His name” (9.28.5).</p>
<p>What all this implies is that Paul is deeply sensitive to the suering </p>
<p>and shame that the essalonians are experiencing and he is concerned </p>
<p>with how they respond to this problem. No doubt some essalonian be-</p>
<p>lievers were having their honor diminished by criticism and rejection from </p>
<p>friends, neighbors, coworkers, and fellow citizens. Looking at Paul’s rhe-</p>
<p>torical strategy from the perspective of honor discourse, he was interested </p>
<p>in re-constituting the essalonians churches’ “court of reputation.” Ac-</p>
<p>cording to David deSilva, this language is used by social-scientists to refer </p>
<p>to “that body of signicant others whose ‘opinion’ about what is honorable </p>
and shameful, and whose evaluation of the individual, really matters.”
<p>5</p>
<p>By</p>
<p>focusing in 2 ess 1:3 on the apostles’ own compulsion to give thanks </p>
<p>to God, Paul was transferring the “court of reputation” from hostile es-</p>
<p>salonian neighbors to God “whose central place is assured because of God’s </p>
<p>power to enforce his estimation of who deserves honor and who merits </p>
<p>censure.”</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>What is Paul specically thankful for? He commends their growing </p>
<p>pistis and their increasing agapē. ese are virtues that peppered the text </p>
<p>of 1 essalonians (1 ess 1:3, 8; 3:2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12; 4:9, 10; 5:8, 13).</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pistis is usually translated “faith,” but one should not take that to mean </p>
<p>that Paul was grateful merely for their inner faith, personal spirituality, or </p>

<p>6. Ibid., 55.</p>
<p>7. Some scholars are quick to note that Paul does not add “hope” (elpis) in 2 ess </p>
<p>1:3 (as is found in 1 ess 1:3), and the argument has been made that this lacuna is </p>
<p>meaningful, i.e., the essalonians were struggling in the historical context of this letter </p>
<p>with lacking Christian hope in a way not yet true when Paul wrote the rst letter. is </p>
<p>is possible, but the mere absence of elpis ought not to carry too much weight by itself.</p>
