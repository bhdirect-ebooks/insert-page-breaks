<p>e Day of the Lord: Preparedness and Perseverance, not Prediction 103</p>
<p>the true God.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Imagine how easily their attention could turn away from</p>
day-to-day faithfulness to Jesus towards signs and omens that might divine
<p>this ill-fated destiny.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Paul tries to refocus the essalonian believers’ attention on the sin-</p>
<p>gular future event that really matters: the Day of the Lord that is coming </p>
<p>like a thief in the night. One can easily sense the irony in this: they know </p>
<p>accurately (akribos) that the Lord Jesus will come unexpectedly! How can </p>
<p>they know precisely about an event that is meant to take them by surprise? </p>
<p>is may be a slight against accepting “accurate” timeline prophecies. As </p>
<p>far as Paul is concerned, the only thing about the future that matters is that </p>
<p>believers should be ever at the ready in anticipation of Jesus’ arrival.</p>
<p>e language of the night-thief as a metaphor for the sudden nature of </p>
<p>the Lord’s return appears to be a common Christian convention that likely </p>
<p>traces back to a Jesus saying such as we have recorded in Matt 24:36–44 </p>
<p>(cf. Luke 12:38–40): “if the owner of the house had known in what part of </p>
<p>the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not </p>
<p>have let his house be broken into. erefore you also must be ready, for the </p>
<p>Son of Man will come when least expected” (Matt 24:43–44).</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Similarly,</p>
<p>we read in 2 Peter 3:10: “But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and </p>
<p>then the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will </p>
<p>be dissolved with re, and the earth and everything that is done on it will </p>
<p>be disclosed.” In view of this total devastation, the readers are exhorted to </p>
<p>live lives of holiness and godliness, signposts of the righteousness that will </p>
<p>characterize life in the “new heavens and new earth” (2 Peter 3:11–13).</p>
<p>First essalonians 5:3 continues on the theme of the unexpected </p>
<p>(especially wrath-bearing) nature of the Day of the Lord. Paul warns them </p>
<p>about people who might say “[there is/will be] peace and security.” Such </p>
<p>people cannot make absolute guarantees—the only one who can ensure </p>
<p>true safety must be the one who holds all power. Whatever the essalo-</p>
<p>nians might have feared, in Paul’s mind, only the Lord Messiah Jesus has </p>
<p>such executive powers, both for deliverance and for retribution.</p>

<p>8. So Witherington: “rather than oering theological comfort food promising an </p>
<p>escape from extreme suering or death, Paul ramps up the eschatological pressure on </p>
<p>the audience to remain faithful and be prepared to suer and if need be die, before the </p>
