<p>Paul’s Blameless Ministry (1 ess 2:1–12) 57</p>
<p>With this in mind, he expresses in 2:8 his aection for the essalo-</p>
<p>nians. Paul became so close to them that he went above and beyond the </p>
<p>normal call of duty, sharing “not only the good news of God, but also the </p>
<p>depths of our souls because you became beloved to us.” e word psychē </p>
<p>is oen translated simply as “souls,” but does not mean a kind of spiritual </p>
<p>self (versus, e.g., a bodily self). He was referring to his most intimate and </p>
<p>vulnerable self.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Some people guard their lives from their work. ink of</p>
<p>a lawyer defending a client, not wanting to get too emotionally involved </p>
<p>in every case. Or a surgeon who tries not to become attached to suering </p>
<p>and grieving patients and families. So too with apostles, it can seem profes-</p>
<p>sional to maintain a cool distance; but with the essalonians Paul simply </p>
<p>could not help himself. As Charles Wanamaker surmises, “He committed </p>
<p>himself totally to the essalonians rather than remaining aloof and unin-</p>
<p>volved in their struggles to come to terms with the new faith that had been </p>
<p>declared to them.”</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Indeed, they had become “beloved” to him (see Rom</p>
<p>1:7; 1 Cor 10:14; Phil 2:12). Given that Paul already reected on the es-</p>
<p>salonians as if they were his own children, one could ll out what he means </p>
<p>by “beloved”: “I am not writing this to make you ashamed, but to admonish </p>
<p>you as my beloved children” (1 Cor 4:14).</p>
<p>In 2:9 Paul reminds the essalonians about his labor and toil and how </p>
<p>they worked night and day so to preach the good news without burdening </p>
<p>the essalonians by asking for money (2:9). He calls them to recall as wit-</p>
<p>nesses his impeccable character (2:10; cf. 2:5). e language of “holy” here </p>
<p>means something like “pure and innocent,” godly in virtue. So also “just” </p>
<p>refers to respectable and upright behavior. “Blameless” means that no fault </p>
<p>could be found in them, no blemish on their record, no whi of suspicion. </p>
<p>Having cycled through various familial metaphors, Paul ends this sec-</p>
<p>tion with the image of a father (pater) who treats his children with care and </p>
<p>concern (2:11–12).</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>It is important to note the emphasis Paul places on</p>
individual attention (hos hena hekaston hymōn). He took special concern
<p>for each and every one, in turn. No one was le out or neglected. As a </p>
<p>father-like apostle, he was committed to caring for them by encouraging </p>
<p>and comforting and insisting so that they might live up to God’s standards. </p>
<p>16. Bruce interprets psychē here as “the seat of aection and will” (1982: 32); Ernest </p>
<p>Best is, perhaps, a bit closer to what I think Paul has in mind when he describes psychē as </p>
<p>“the personality, the real person” (1986: 102).</p>
