<p>Exhortation to Persevere and Grow in Holiness, </p>
<p>Love, and Integrity (1 Thess 4:1–12) </p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Furthermore, my dear brothers and sisters, we ask of you and </p>
<p>urge you in the Lord Jesus, as you received from us instruction </p>
<p>about how you must walk and live to please God—as indeed you </p>
<p>do walk this way—we encourage you to pursue this even more pas-</p>
<p>sionately. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>For you know what instructions we gave you through </p>
<p>the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>is is God’s will: that you are consecrated to him, </p>
<p>namely that you distance yourself from sexual immorality. God </p>
<p>wills that each of you knows how to maintain control of his own </p>
<p>“vessel” with holiness and honor, </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>not yielding to lustful passion </p>
<p>like the Gentiles who do not know God. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Each of you must not </p>
<p>trespass and cheat his brother in this matter, because the Lord </p>
<p>repays justice for all these things, just as we forewarned you and </p>
<p>testied. </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>For God called us not to be impure, but to be holy. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>erefore, whoever rejects this teaching is not rejecting a mere </p>
<p>mortal but rather rejects the God who gives his Holy Spirit to you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Now, on the matter of love for siblings, you do not need us </p>
<p>to write to you, because you yourselves are taught by God when it </p>
<p>comes to mutual love. </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Indeed, you already do it, you have shown </p>
<p>love for all the brothers and sisters in all of Macedonia. And we </p>
<p>encourage you, my dear brothers and sisters, to let this love over-</p>
<p>ow even more. </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>And set your ambition on living a quiet life: </p>
<p>attend to your own aairs and work with your own hands, just as </p>
<p>we commanded you. </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>en you will walk in the proper way in </p>
<p>view of outsiders and you will need nothing. </p>
<p>In the rst three chapters of 1 essalonians, Paul’s primary concern </p>
<p>involved extending compassion and comfort to a suering and troubled </p>
<p>church. ere is a gracious, warm, generous tone. He reminds them of how </p>
<p>special they are, and how attentive God is to their plight. He reminds them </p>
<p>of how God has worked among them in power in the past, he is at work in </p>
<p>the present, and he will act again on their behalf through Messiah Jesus at </p>
<p>his return. He confesses to them his longing to have close fellowship with </p>
<p>them—they are loved and missed. </p>
