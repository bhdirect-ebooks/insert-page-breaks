<p>Paul’s Blameless Ministry (1 ess 2:1–12) 53</p>
<p>the midst of intense suering and mistreatment. To get a sense for what this </p>
<p>mistreatment may have looked like, we could turn to Acts 14:5 where the </p>
<p>same term hybrizō (“mistreated”) also appears. ere Luke recounts that </p>
<p>Gentiles and Jews harassed Paul and Barnabas at Iconium, a situation that </p>
<p>escalated to the level of their nearly being stoned to death. e term hybrizō </p>
<p>was also used by Luke in respect to Jesus when, at his trial, he was derided </p>
<p>and spat upon (Luke 18:32). In view of such provocation, it was admirable </p>
<p>for Paul and his companions to be courageous and continue to preach the </p>
<p>good news openly.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>When Paul writes about being “given courage,” this</p>
<p>term (parrēsiazomai) carries the idea of public, condent testimony. ere </p>
<p>is a kind of “devil-may-care” stubbornness here. Paul is shaping a particular </p>
<p>vision that carves out a safe space for Christian identity that can withstand </p>
<p>the storms and winds of unfavorable public opinion.</p>
<p>Paul’s Integrity (2:3–7a)</p>
<p>Paul goes on to talk about his ministry, especially that he behaved in their </p>
<p>presence in an upright and blameless manner—he showed unassailable </p>
<p>integrity. His main concern is to be an example for the essalonians re-</p>
<p>garding how to respond to pressure and conict with integrity and how to </p>
<p>maintain an irreproachable reputation. </p>
<p>In 2:3, when he refers to the introduction of his message or appeal, he </p>
<p>urges that it did not come from error, meaning that it was not a distortion </p>
<p>of the truth. Nor from impure motives, as if aligned with wickedness. And </p>
<p>far be it that it arose from trickery. He is insistent that his apostolic team </p>
<p>was “approved by God” and that the good-news message was “entrusted” </p>
<p>to them (2:4a). ey were thoroughly inspected by the God who knows </p>
<p>and sees all and they were found responsible as trustees of the truth. With </p>
<p>that commission, and before the all-knowing God (who tests hearts</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>), their </p>
<p>mission is to seek to please God (not merely to please mortals, as con art-</p>
<p>4. See Gaventa 1998: 24; Wanamaker, 1990: 92.</p>
<p>5. It is possible, when Paul refers to the God who tests hearts, he has something in </p>
<p>mind akin to Sirach 2:1–5: “My child, when you come to serve the Lord, prepare yourself </p>
<p>for testing. Set your heart right and be steadfast, and do not be impetuous in time of ca-</p>
<p>lamity. Cling to him and do not depart, so that your last days may be prosperous. Accept </p>
<p>whatever befalls you, and in times of humiliation be patient. For gold is tested in re, and </p>
<p>those found acceptable, in the furnace of humiliation.” Certainly, Paul could have earned </p>
<p>a reputation for integrity amidst such persistent persecution (cf. Prov 17:3). He appears </p>
<p>to have wanted to assure the essalonians that his cohort should be counted among the </p>
<p>righteous and upright.</p>
