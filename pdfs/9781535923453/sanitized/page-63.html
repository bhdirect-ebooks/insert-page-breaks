<p>Paul’s Blameless Ministry (1 ess 2:1–12) 51</p>
<p>motives have been questioned by the essalonians), or if his apologia is </p>
<p>more instructive (directing his readers to his model behavior in the face </p>
<p>of diculty and temptation). Perhaps it is best to think of this section as </p>
<p>serving both interests. Given Paul mentions his premature separation from </p>
<p>them (2:17; cf. Acts 17:14), it very well could have been that one day Paul </p>
<p>was with the essalonians preaching and ministering to them, and the </p>
<p>next day he was just gone. is may have shocked many essalonian be-</p>
<p>lievers and Paul may have fell under suspicion of being a kind of con man. </p>
<p>While he is very clear that he did not force them to pay him money (2:9), </p>
<p>he probably would not have refused gis from generous believers (see Phil </p>
<p>4:15). If rumors spread that Paul was a fraud, his tone and insistence in this </p>
<p>section would be sensible (not unlike the tone of 2 Corinthians; see below). </p>
<p>Jerey Weima has oered what is probably the strongest rationale for </p>
<p>the view that Paul was, in fact, defending his character and ministry in </p>
<p>view of criticisms, potential or real. ree pieces of “evidence” from 1 ess </p>
<p>2:1–12 lead Weima to this conclusion. Firstly, we have, twice stated, appeal </p>
<p>to God as witness (2:5, 10)—a relatively rare phenomenon in the Pauline </p>
<p>corpus (Rom 1:9; 2 Cor 1:23; Phil 1:8). Secondly, Paul refers to his having </p>
<p>been examined and approved by God for his ministry (2:4). irdly, Weima </p>
<p>appeals to the string of antithetical statement in 2:1–12. I would register </p>
<p>my own pieces of evidence in addition to Weima’s. e possibility that Paul </p>
<p>takes on a defensive tone in 1 ess 2:1–12 is strengthened signicantly by </p>
<p>the appearance of remarkably similar language in 2 Cor 12:11–19, a text </p>
<p>where it is certain that Paul’s rhetoric is defensive. </p>
<p>Look, for the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will </p>
<p>not be a burden (katanarkoō) to you, because I do not want your </p>
<p>possessions, but you. For children should not have to save up for </p>
<p>their parents, but parents for their children. Now I will most gladly </p>
<p>spend and be spent for your lives! If I love you more, am I to be </p>
<p>loved less? But be that as it may, I have not burdened (katabareō) </p>
<p>you. Yet because I was a cray person (panourgos), I took you in by </p>
<p>deceit (dolos)! I have not taken advantage of you through anyone </p>
<p>I have sent to you, have I? I urged Titus to visit you and I sent </p>
<p>our brother along with him. Titus did not take advantage of you, </p>
<p>did he? Did we not conduct ourselves in the same spirit? Did we </p>
<p>not behave in the same way. Have you been thinking all this time </p>
<p>that we have been defending ourselves to you? We are speaking in </p>
<p>Christ before God, and everything we do, dear friends, is to build </p>
<p>you up. (2 Cor 12:14–19 NET) </p>
