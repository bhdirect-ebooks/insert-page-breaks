<p>Thanksgiving and Hope (2 Thess 1:1–12)</p>
<p>2 Thessalonians 1:1–12</p>
<p>Prescript (1:1–2)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy to the church of the essalonians in </p>
<p>God our Father and the Lord Messiah Jesus, </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>grace and peace to </p>
<p>you from God our Father and the Lord Messiah Jesus. </p>
<p>eologian omas Oden recounts a vivid dream where he was walking </p>
<p>through New Haven cemetery and happened across his own tombstone. </p>
<p>e epitaph read: “He made no new contribution to theology.” For many </p>
<p>theologians, this moment would signal that the dream was actually a night-</p>
<p>mare, but Oden woke up relieved. He came to the realization that being a </p>
<p>successful theologian did not require constant novelty.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>is story might help the reader of 2 essalonians to put an obvious </p>
<p>feature of this text into perspective: it’s not terribly original. In many ways, </p>
<p>2 essalonians is a re-expression of 1 essalonians, repeating many of </p>
<p>the earlier text’s themes, arguments, and sometimes even its wording. In </p>
<p>fact the opening greeting of 2 essalonians is almost identical to 1 ess </p>
<p>1:1–2.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> But for Paul, some things do not need to be said dierently. He, Sil-</p>
<p>vanus, and Timothy wrote again to this church and desired to underscore </p>
<p>that who they are, as a community, is dened by their relationship with </p>
<p>God the Father and the Lord Messiah Jesus.</p>
<p>1. See Oden 2014: 144.</p>
<p>2. 2 essalonians adds “our” before “Father” in v. 1, and in v. 2 includes aer “grace </p>
<p>and peace” the following: “from God the Father and the Lord Messiah Jesus.” </p>
