<p>anksgiving for the essalonians (1 ess 1:1–10) 47</p>
<p>fame spread throughout Macedonia and Achaia and beyond, and they be-</p>
<p>came a model and example of gracious perseverance (1:7–8).</p>
<p>So admirable and even unexpected was their bold loyalty to Jesus that </p>
<p>the message about him spread quickly, moving even faster than the apostles </p>
<p>could travel to share this news. One is reminded of the Israelite spies who </p>
<p>encountered Rahab. e Canaanite prostitute did not need to be told about </p>
<p>the fame of Israel and the power of Yahweh because she had already heard </p>
<p>and she revered the God who “dried up the water of the Red Sea” (Joshua </p>
<p>2:9–11)!</p>
<p>Apparently, distant Achaians and Macedonians came to know the </p>
<p>story of the work of God amongst the essalonians, in particular how </p>
<p>they “turned towards God, rejecting idols in order to serve a new mas-</p>
<p>ter, the living and true God” (1 ess 1:9). Paul helpfully clues us into the </p>
<p>probability that the essalonians are mostly Gentile believers, since Jews </p>
<p>abhorred idols (Rom 2:22) and considered worshipping with cult statues </p>
<p>a mark of reprobation (1 Cor 5:10–11; 6:9; Gal 5:20; cf. 1 Pet 4:3).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Idols</p>
<p>were known to be, according to Jewish thought, dead and inecacious (cf. </p>
<p>Acts 14:15).</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Given that the early Christians represent pagan worship as</p>
<p>a kind of ignorance and slavery (Heb 9:14), it takes the intervening work </p>
<p>of God to bring illumination, wisdom, and freedom to know and worship </p>
<p>the true God.</p>
<p>If we look at a Jewish text like Bel and the Dragon, we learn that Jews </p>
<p>(like Paul) were educated with stories that reminded them that idols are not </p>
<p>real gods, but objects made with human hands. is is distinctly not true of </p>
<p>the living God who created all things and rules over all creatures (see Bel </p>
<p>1:5). Idols reect the imagination of their artisan (a mere human) and, thus, </p>
<p>they are as corrupted as human sinners. us, Jews and Christians could </p>
<p>associate idolatry with sexual perversion and greed (see Col 3:5). When </p>
<p>the essalonians rejected their idols, then, they also turned away from </p>
<p>a pagan, godless way of life. As Beverly Gaventa explains, this required a </p>
<p>whole new way of life: </p>
<p>Paul’s words about turning from idols to serve God imply that faith </p>
<p>in the God of Israel who is the Father of Jesus Christ is not an </p>
<p>10. Note, though, that in the Introduction I consider the possibility, even likelihood, </p>
<p>that this church was comprised of many “god-fearers,” Gentile pagans at once time asso-</p>
<p>ciated with the Jewish synagogue and later became believers in Messiah Jesus. See 6–13.</p>
<p>11. For a discussion of Jewish anti-idol polemic and Gentile cult statue worship in </p>
<p>the era of the New Testament, see Gupta 2014.</p>
