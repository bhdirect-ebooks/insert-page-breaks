<p>Who Wrote 2 essalonians?</p>
<p>In the above examination of 2 essalonians, we have taken for granted that </p>
<p>Paul wrote 2 essalonians. However, especially since the early twentieth </p>
<p>century, scholars have wondered whether Paul wrote it, or it was written </p>
<p>by someone else in his name (i.e., pseudonymous).</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> For most of the twen-</p>
<p>tieth century, more and more scholars accepted the arguments for 2 es-</p>
<p>salonians being pseudonymous. e reasons for this are many and vary </p>
<p>somewhat from one scholar to the next, but these features tend to be raised </p>
<p>when 2 essalonians’ authenticity is questioned: copycat, style, historical </p>
<p>implausibility, tone, pseudonymous “tells,” and theological dierences.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>Against Pauline Authorship</p>
<p>Copycat</p>
<p>A rst, and perhaps the most decisive, reason that some scholars believe </p>
<p>2 essalonians is pseudonymous is its relationship to 1 essalonians, in </p>
<p>particular how similar it is.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>Edgar Krentz points to several identical (or</p>
<p>nearly-identical) features: identical salutations (1 ess 1:1; 2 ess 1:1), </p>
<p>both have long thanksgivings, both include a second thanksgiving in the </p>
<p>middle of the letter (1 ess 2:13; 2 ess 2:13), both have letter bodies </p>
<p>which close with “a request to God expressed by a volitive optative.”</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>Both</p>
<p>letters also ask the “God/Lord of peace” to do something (1 ess 5:23–24; </p>
<p>76. In 1798, J. E. C. Schmidt argued that, while 2 essalonians was probably written </p>
<p>by Paul, the section 2:1–12 was a later insertion into the text by a separate writer. In 1903, </p>
<p>W. Wrede made a more comprehensive case for 2 essalonians being pseudonymous; </p>
<p>for an insightful, though brief, discussion of the history of scholarship on the authorship </p>
<p>of 2 essalonians, see iselton 2011: 11–15.</p>
<p>77. It is sometimes noted that 2 essalonians includes vocabulary unusual for Paul, </p>
<p>but this kind of argument has largely been debunked for two reasons; rstly, each extant </p>
<p>letter of Paul contains its own set of distinctive vocabulary based on the specic subjects </p>
<p>of that letter in its context; second, we are simply dealing with too small of a sample of </p>
<p>Paul’s writings to decide what kind of words count as “unpauline.” Even those who are </p>
<p>certain that Paul did not write 2 essalonians admit that the study of the vocabulary of </p>
<p>this text contributes little to the debate; see Krentz 2009: 444; Menken 1994: 32: “ere </p>
<p>is a more or less general agreement that, from the point of vocabulary, 2 essalonians is </p>
<p>no less Pauline than the recognized letters.”</p>
<p>78. So Menken 1994: “is literary dependence is the decisive argument against Pau-</p>
<p>line authorship of 2 essalonians” (40); see also Boring 2015: 212.</p>
<p>79. Krentz 1992: 6.518.</p>
