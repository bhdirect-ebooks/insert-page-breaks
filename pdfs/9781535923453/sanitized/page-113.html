<p>The Day of the Lord: Preparedness and </p>
<p>Perseverance, not Prediction (1 Thess 5:1–11) </p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Now on the matter of “times and seasons,” my dear brothers and </p>
<p>sisters, there is no need for us to write to you. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>For you know accu-</p>
<p>rately for yourselves that the Day of the Lord is coming like a thief </p>
<p>comes at night. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Whenever they might say, “peace and security,” </p>
<p>then suddenly destruction falls upon them just as labor pains for </p>
<p>a pregnant woman. And there will be no escape. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>As for you, my </p>
<p>dear brothers and sisters, you are not in the dark for the day to </p>
<p>overtake you in surprise like a thief. </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>For all of you are children </p>
<p>of light and children of day. We are not night-people or darkness-</p>
<p>people. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>erefore let us not fall asleep as the rest, but rather let us </p>
<p>be awake and fully alert. </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>For those who sleep sleep at night and </p>
<p>those who drink get drunk at night. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>But as for us, day-people, let </p>
<p>us stand at the ready, having dressed in the breastplate of loyalty </p>
<p>and love, and having donned the helmet of the hope of salvation. </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>For God did not destine us to suer God’s anger for justice, but </p>
<p>instead he destined us to obtain salvation through our Lord Mes-</p>
<p>siah Jesus. </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>He died for us so that, whether we are “awake” or </p>
<p>“asleep,” we will live with him. </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>erefore, comfort one another </p>
<p>and each of you build up the other, as you are already doing. </p>
<p>From 4:13–18 to 5:1–11 we can sense a clear change of subject from the </p>
<p>fate of the dead (“sleeping”) in the Messiah to the fate of those essalonian </p>
<p>believers still alive.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>e introductory phrase, “Now on the matter of” (peri</p>
<p>de), clues us into the nature of the subject (see 1 Cor 7:1; 8:1; 12:1; 16:1), </p>
<p>“times and seasons.” Some interpreters argue that this peri de construction </p>
<p>shows that the essalonians raised the matter of “times and seasons.” Oth-</p>
<p>ers believe that Paul simply wanted to oer a relevant teaching. However, </p>
<p>it very well could be that there is a both-and going on—perhaps the es-</p>
<p>salonians wondered about the nature and timing of future events (what </p>
<p>is going to happen next?) and Paul chose to word the matter in his own </p>
<p>way (“times and seasons”). In any case, the subject of “when” is quickly </p>
<p>1. See Holmes 1998: 165.</p>
