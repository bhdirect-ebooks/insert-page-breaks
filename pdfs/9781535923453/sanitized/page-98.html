<p>Exhortation to Persevere and Grow in Holiness, Love, and Integrity86</p>
<p>Paul’s point in saying this would be to comfort and encourage the </p>
<p>essalonians who have suered physically and emotionally in light of re-</p>
<p>cent events (especially the death of community members). No doubt they </p>
<p>were wondering—what is happening? What should we do? How do we move </p>
<p>forward? Paul, the excellent pastor that he is, reminds them of who they are </p>
<p>as part of the family of God in Messiah Jesus, and he gently exhorts them to </p>
<p>excel in the love that God has already taught them how to share.</p>

<p>Fusing the Horizons 5.1: A New Covenant Community of Love</p>
<p>When I was in seminary, I experienced a kind of crisis of faith. Some of the </p>
<p>students in my classes expressed their serious interest in “theology,” and read </p>
<p>their textbooks with utter devotion. They wrote impressive term papers and </p>
<p>even met with professors outside of class for further instruction. However, </p>
<p>as I lived with many of these students in the dorms, I became uneasy with a </p>
<p>startling realization: they excelled in academic knowledge but many did not </p>
<p>dedicate themselves to holiness, discipleship, and Christian love. Some went </p>
<p>to the pub and got drunk on a regular basis. Others destroyed school property </p>
<p>for fun. And the term “humility” could hardly characterize many of these </p>
<p>students. </p>
<p>They had been taught about God, but it could hardly be said that they </p>
<p>were theodidaktos—“God-taught.” In Paul’s reckoning, the Christian cannot </p>
<p>be merely engaged in intellectual exercises and call it Christian “teaching.” </p>
<p>To be taught by God, to be taught by God the Spirit, is to be transformed. St. </p>
<p>Augustine reﬂects on this idea of true Christian teaching in this way.</p>
<p>It is through grace that we not only discover what ought to be done </p>
<p>but also that we do what we have discovered. That is, not only that </p>
<p>we believe what ought to be loved but also that we love what we </p>
<p>have believed. If this grace is to be called “teaching,” let it at any </p>
<p>rate be called “teaching” in such a manner that God may be be-</p>
<p>lieved to infuse it, along with an ineffable sweetness, more deeply </p>
<p>and more internally. This teaching, therefore, would be not only by </p>

<p>25. Given the emphasis in chapter ve on prophecy, it might be the case that the </p>
<p>unexpected death of community members led the essalonians on a hunt for more </p>
divine revelation. If so, Paul’s point here might be that their focus should not be on learn-
<p>ing something new from God (in terms of information), as much as growing in what they </p>
<p>already know (i.e., love).</p>
