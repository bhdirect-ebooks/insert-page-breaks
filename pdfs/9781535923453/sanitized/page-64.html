<p>Paul’s Blameless Ministry (1 ess 2:1–12)52</p>
<p>First essalonians 2:1–12 bears more than a few similarities to what </p>
<p>Paul writes above. Notice the use of dolos (deceit) in both places (1 ess </p>
<p>2:3; 2 Cor 12:16), as well as the language of burdening (epibareō 1 ess 2:9; </p>
<p>katabareō 2 Cor 12:16).</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>If there is a question as to whether or not Paul’s</p>
<p>self-descriptive language in 1 ess 2:1–12 has a genuinely defensive pur-</p>
<p>pose (to put to rest any concerns or criticisms from the essalonians about </p>
<p>his motives or intentions), the connections between this passage and 2 Cor </p>
<p>12:14–19 (where a real defensive concern is explicit in chapters 10–13) </p>
<p>convince me that Paul is doing more than oering himself as a model of </p>
<p>good behavior.</p>
<p>e above notwithstanding, it is a mistake to think that 1 ess 2:1–12 </p>
<p>is only apologetic or self-defensive. Paul did not write 1 essalonians as his </p>
<p>deposition in view of an apostolic trial. e letter is, ultimately, a letter of </p>
<p>encouragement and instruction for the sake of the essalonians. us, the </p>
<p>idea that Paul had a self-defensive interest should not cancel out his con-</p>
<p>cern to be a model for the essalonians and to enjoin them to good-news </p>
<p>obedience. As Michael Holmes aptly puts it, “e heavy concentration of </p>
<p>direct appeals in the last part of the passage (2:9–12), in which Paul re-</p>
<p>minds the essalonians of how he exhorted them to holy living, conrms </p>
<p>that the primary function of this section is not defense or apologetics but </p>
<p>exhortation.”</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>If we link 2:1–12 to the larger concerns of the letter and the situation </p>
<p>of the essalonians, it makes good sense to see this passage as positioning </p>
<p>Paul as the model of one who works and labors and endures in the face of </p>
<p>opposition and problems. is seems to be the more important contribu-</p>
<p>tion of this section. Paul draws attention, in particular, to three areas: his </p>
<p>courage (2:1–2), his integrity (2:3–7a), and his tender-care (2:7b-12).</p>
<p>Paul’s Courage (2:1–2)</p>
<p>Paul, beginning again with appeal to the essalonians as his Christian sib-</p>
<p>lings (see 17–18), calls them to remember. In the rst chapter he urged them </p>
<p>to recall their conversion and their commitment to Jesus. Now, in chapter </p>
<p>two, he prompts them to call to mind a viewpoint of his part of the story, </p>
<p>where Paul, Timothy, and Silvanus did not forsake their vocation even in </p>
<p>2. Epibareō and katabareō are cognates that share the same root in Greek (bar*); </p>
<p>according to standard Greek lexicons, their meanings are indistinguishable.</p>
