<p>Preface</p>
<p>To say that researching for and writing this commentary was a delight </p>
<p>would be an understatement. It was an act of joyful sanctication to bathe </p>
<p>myself in the Greek and English texts of 1–2 essalonians on nearly a </p>
<p>daily basis for a couple of years. Sometimes it is questioned whether yet </p>
<p>another commentary is needed, not least on 1–2 essalonians where there </p>
<p>are already a number of good works on the shelves. My perspective is that </p>
<p>it is an ongoing exercise of hearing the Word of God afresh. I was eager to </p>
<p>write this commentary for the joy of my own learning, and doing “theologi-</p>
<p>cal reasoning” about what these letters mean for us today. As I have had </p>
<p>opportunities to share some of my research and ndings with students, I </p>
<p>have become more and more convinced that 1–2 essalonians are too-</p>
<p>oen-overlooked gems in Scripture. We glimpse some of the most striking </p>
<p>moments of Paul as vulnerable, humble pastor and friend. We get a sense </p>
<p>for how Paul calls believers to respond to suering. We learn about the dig-</p>
<p>nity and worth of good, honest labor as productive work as well as public </p>
<p>witness to the gospel. First and Second essalonians have a unique ability </p>
<p>to speak to us, not in spite of the fact that they do not instruct in a general </p>
<p>and generic manner, but because they are so heavily contextualized. We are </p>
<p>privileged to catch a glimpse of Paul’s “real life,” “real relationships,” and </p>
<p>“real struggles.” And we see an Apostle, his apostolic companions, and his </p>
<p>fellow believers come together as a household of faith under God the Father </p>
<p>and through the unique Son, Messiah Jesus, to encourage one another. It is </p>
<p>a beautiful display of the church.</p>
<p>My thanks go to the series editors, Michael Bird and Craig Keener, for </p>
<p>the invitation to be involved in this series. I am especially grateful for their </p>
vision to acquire a globally diverse set of authors, and for their being mind-
<p>ful about including voices of women and ethnic minorities. ere were a </p>
<p>number of scholars who were kind enough to share with me unpublished </p>
<p>materials on the essalonian Correspondence; my gratitude goes to them: </p>
<p>Karl Donfried, Gene Boring, Todd Still, John Byron, Andy Johnson, Steve </p>
<p>Walton, and Michael Gorman. </p>
