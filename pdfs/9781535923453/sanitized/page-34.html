<p>to money. So many con men paraded through town and took money from </p>
<p>gullible locals. Paul wanted to protect the integrity of the gospel. </p>
<p>Another key point that Paul underscores is the importance of daily </p>
<p>work in order to continue to be productive in the community and to care </p>
<p>for any needs. Some lagged on their work, perhaps even began leeching o </p>
<p>of wealthy, sympathetic fellow-believers. As generous as this might be, Paul </p>
<p>wanted to encourage each person to be responsible and productive as they </p>
<p>are able. Paul tells the essalonians to put their hands to good use, to focus </p>
<p>on being a contributor to the community “so that you may command the </p>
<p>respect of outsiders, and be dependent on nobody” (4:11–12). Raymond </p>
<p>Collins oers a salutary reminder that Paul teaches us what it means to be </p>
<p>human in his work. </p>
<p>How we work is a matter of imitating the example of the apostle </p>
<p>Paul and his companions. Working is a way of being a responsible </p>
<p>co-citizen within society. How we work is also a matter of respon-</p>
<p>sible participation in the ongoing creation of God, whose own tale </p>
<p>of creation is cast in the form of a story about someone at work </p>
<p>(Gen 1).</p>

<p>Hope and Endurance</p>
<p>is introduction began with a reection on “hope” (elpis) as a central </p>
<p>theme for 1–2 essalonians. I will only briey touch upon this again. Paul </p>
<p>mentions that he gives thanks for their “endurance of hope”—the persever-</p>
<p>ance and tenacious forward-march that is produced by a hunger to em-</p>
<p>brace God’s promised future. Interestingly, Paul says that his hope is the </p>
<p>essalonians (2:19). How can he say this? Because he sees the power of </p>
<p>God at work in their trust in God and believing allegiance to the Messiah, </p>
<p>and he foresees God’s validation of his ministry work as God judges their </p>
<p>lives. Paul’s hope wasn’t “blind.” He could see it in the lives of his children.</p>
<p>Paul was a bit fearful that they might lose their hope, having lost loved </p>
<p>ones and beginning to lose their focus (4:13). Paul does not tell them to </p>
<p>stop grieving. He does not tell them to “put on a happy face.” Grieve, yes. </p>
<p>But grieve with hope. Grief with hope is lament without despair. </p>
<p>I am reminded of Hosea 6:1–3. </p>
