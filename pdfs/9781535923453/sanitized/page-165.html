<p>Fusing the Horizons: Leadership and Work 153</p>
<p>I admire Christian leaders in both contexts, those in full-time ministry </p>
<p>and tent-makers. Sometimes, though, I am concerned with some in the former </p>
<p>category because it can seem like the move to full-time ministry leadership </p>
<p>lessens the value of mundane work and manual labor. Furthermore, when </p>
<p>full-time pastors or Christian leaders see themselves as CEOs, they presume </p>
<p>that they should be paid like CEOs rather than as those who labor simply and </p>
<p>humbly for the sake of the gospel.</p>
<p>I am reminded of two stories. First, I had a mentor in college who was </p>
<p>on staff with a Christian parachurch ministry. His income came from donors, </p>
<p>but my memories of him are of someone who felt very comfortable working </p>
<p>with his hands. I remember stopping by his house one day just to say hello </p>
<p>and he invited me out back to talk in the yard—he grabbed two rakes and we </p>
<p>raked leaves and chatted. Also, I remember another occasion where he invited </p>
<p>several students from the ministry to come to his house for ice cream—and to </p>
<p>pull up old carpet. We did not feel used because he got down on the ground </p>
<p>cutting and tearing carpet with us, and we knew him to be a man who always </p>
<p>lived humbly and simply.</p>
<p>Second story: this one comes from the sixth century BC. Lucius Quinctius </p>
<p>Cincinnatus was a farmer in the Roman empire. In 458 BC, Rome appointed </p>
<p>him dictator to rescue a consular army from the Aequi. He extinguished the </p>
<p>threat in a day and stayed in power a mere sixteen days to restore stability. </p>
<p>Then he relinquished his control and went back to the farm.</p>
<p>Sometimes, perhaps too often, positions of leadership can give us delu-</p>
<p>sions of grandeur, plunge us into a competitive world where we begin to aspire </p>
<p>to be recognized and rewarded. When Paul promotes eating one’s own bread </p>
<p>and living a quiet life, he is not condemning ambition, but rather a mindset </p>
<p>of elitism and the denigration of simple labor. Living a quiet life means doing </p>
<p>the work for the sake of its own productivity and return, rather than seeing </p>
<p>freedom from mundane work as a sign of unique achievement and status. </p>
