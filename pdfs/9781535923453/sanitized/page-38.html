<p>Introduction26</p>
<p>As to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered </p>
<p>together to him, we beg you, brothers and sisters, not to be quickly </p>
<p>shaken in mind or alarmed, either by spirit or by word or by letter, </p>
<p>as though from us, to the eect that the Day of the Lord is already </p>
<p>here. (2 ess 2:1–2) </p>
<p>Paul’s reference here to being taught (spirit/word/letter) about the ar-</p>
<p>rival of the Day of the Lord appears to imply that some group was impress-</p>
<p>ing this notion on them—further evidenced by his next warning that they </p>
<p>be deceived by no one (2:3). Who would have taught them this is unclear. </p>
<p>Traditionally, scholars have assumed that Paul wrote 2 essalonians </p>
<p>to correct a misunderstanding of his earlier instruction that the Day of the </p>
<p>Lord will come suddenly (cf. 1 ess 5:2). Here in 2 essalonians, accord-</p>
<p>ing to this view, the essalonians “can relax because the apocalyptic signs </p>
<p>that must precede the coming of that day have not yet occurred, namely, </p>
<p>the apostasy, the appearance of the lawless one or son of perdition who is </p>
<p>anti-God, and the activity of Satan with portended signs and wonders.”</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, 2 essalonians does not oer a point-by-point timeline of es-</p>
<p>chatological events. ere is a bigger concern at work in this text.</p>
<p>My own hunch is that the same Jews that persecuted the essalo-</p>
<p>nians somehow convinced them that the “Day of the Lord” has dawned—</p>
<p>not completely, but insofar as the traumatic events experienced in their </p>
community (e.g., deaths) are evidence of divine displeasure.
<p>70</p>
<p>Perhaps their</p>
<p>message to the essalonian believers was this: We are beginning to see the </p>
<p>wrath of God, repent and return to our community. It may not be too late. If </p>
<p>this is the case, Paul’s letter carries the urgent task of re-establishing their </p>
<p>identity in the community of Jesus and that the essalonians are safe and </p>
<p>secure in Messiah Jesus alone.</p>
<p>In the central section of 2 ess 2:1–12, Paul’s main points about es-</p>
<p>chatological events are these:</p>
<p>• ings will get much worse before they will get better—expect a great </p>
<p>“rebellion” among those who claim to know God (2:3)</p>
<p>69. Brown 1997: 590.</p>
<p>70. John Barclay points to the years 51–52, according to Tacitus, as “particularly ill </p>
<p>omened, with prodigies such as repeated earthquakes and a famine.” is may have led </p>
<p>the essalonians to believe that the Day of the Lord had dawned. But Barclay adds this </p>
<p>caveat: “it is not necessary to rely on this precarious, though tantalizing, connection. A </p>
<p>fevered apocalyptic imagination can interpret almost any unusual event as an eschato-</p>
logical moment, and divine wrath can explain many types of calamities.” See Barclay
<p>1993: 527–28.</p>
