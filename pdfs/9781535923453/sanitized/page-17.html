<p>Introduction 5</p>
<p>We should also add that essalonica established a cult in honor of the </p>
<p>goddess Roma. Furthermore, they built a temple for Caesar. e essalo-</p>
<p>nians, as noted above, understood the signicance of showing loyalty and </p>
respect to Rome. Coins have been discovered that identify Caesar as divine. To challenge the divinity of Caesar would be a threat against Rome itself.
<p>is may oer important background for understanding the seriousness of </p>
<p>the threats against Paul and his ministry when he was brought before the </p>
<p>city ocials (the politarchs) on the accusation that he was supporting a </p>
<p>rival king named Jesus (Acts 17:5–6).</p>
<p>Paul in essalonica</p>
<p>While Paul mentions his coming to essalonica in 1 essalonians, the </p>
<p>book of Acts contains a number of details about his experience there.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While in Troas (Asia Minor), Paul received a vision of a “man of Mace-</p>
<p>donia” begging him to cross over into Macedonia to help his people (Acts </p>
<p>16:9). Paul and Silas wasted no time setting sail into Samothrace and </p>
<p>Neapolis to bring the gospel to the Macedonians. He eventually went to </p>
<p>Philippi where his ministry caused a stir and locals accused them before the </p>
<p>authorities. ey were beaten and imprisoned, but the Lord miraculously </p>
<p>delivered them. Before departing from Philippi, Paul and Silas encouraged </p>
<p>the new believers there including Lydia, the rst convert of Europe.</p>
<p>Paul and Silas travelled through Amphipolis and Apollonia to essa-</p>
<p>lonica. ey went to the essalonian Jewish synagogue and Paul preached </p>
<p>about Messiah Jesus on three Sabbath days (17:1–2). Luke recounts that </p>
<p>“Some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a great </p>
<p>many of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women” (17:4).</p>
<p>Some jealous Jews incited “ruans” (F. F. Bruce refers to them as a </p>
<p>“rent-a-mob”!) to turn the city against Paul and Silas. Unable to locate the </p>
<p>two strangers, the mob attacked Paul’s host Jason and other new believers </p>
<p>in Jesus. ey were brought before the city authorities under this accusa-</p>
<p>tion: “ese people who have been turning the world upside down have </p>
<p>come here also, and Jason has entertained them as guests. ey are all </p>
<p>11. Some scholars question the historicity of Acts and, thus, its relevance for recon-</p>
<p>structing Paul’s experience there. However, this commentary follows the lead of a num-</p>
<p>ber of scholars who accept the general accounts of Luke’s narrative understanding that, </p>
<p>while he had his own theological interests, he was still intending to convey the history of </p>
<p>the earliest church. See Keener 2012.</p>
