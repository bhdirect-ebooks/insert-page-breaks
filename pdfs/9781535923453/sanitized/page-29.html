<p>Introduction 17</p>
<p>Family</p>
<p>ere is no more powerful and comprehensive metaphor used in 1 essa-</p>
<p>lonians than that of the church as family. It is easily recognized, even from </p>
<p>the rst verse, that God is called Father (1:1; cf. 1:3; 3:11, 13). More striking </p>
<p>than that, though, is the frequency with which Paul calls the essalonian </p>
<p>believers brothers and sisters (adelphoi).</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>e community of Messiah Jesus</p>
<p>is more than a club of like-minded religious people. ey belong together </p>
<p>in the most intimate kind of relationship that can be conceived.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> So well-</p>
<p>known did this image become of early Christianity that in the second cen-</p>
<p>tury outsiders accused Christians of being incestuous because some were </p>
<p>married who called each other brother and sister.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>Paul does not explain why he calls the essalonians “brothers and </p>
<p>sisters,” but undoubtedly this would have been explained when he rst </p>
<p>taught them about their faith. Paul would have preached about the unique </p>
<p>sonship of Messiah Jesus, Son of God, and that all may also become chil-</p>
<p>dren of the one God through Jesus, Gentiles receiving the blessing of being </p>
<p>included in the unique adoption of Israel (Rom 8:29; Gal 4:5; cf. Rom 9:4; </p>
<p>Col 1:13; Eph 1:5). </p>
<p>For Paul, to be “brothers and sisters” through the Messiah is not mere-</p>
<p>ly a term of endearment, nor simply a theological construct; Paul expected </p>
<p>the reality of this theological truth to create an intimate community. Begin-</p>
<p>ning in 4:9, Paul addresses the matter of philadelphia—sibling-love. It was </p>
<p>encoded into their corporate life to express this kind of kinship love and </p>
<p>Paul commends them for this. He expected—and found—deep aection </p>
<p>within this group.</p>
<p>As for Paul’s own relationship with the essalonians, part of his pur-</p>
<p>pose in writing the letter, no doubt, is to underscore his love and aection </p>
<p>Israel (beloved, chosen, etc.) to describe these essalonian Gentile believers; see above </p>
<p>12–13.</p>
<p>50. e Greek word adelphos (brother) appears almost twenty times in this one short </p>
<p>letter (1:4; 2:1, 9, 14, 17; 2:14, 17; 3:2, 7; 4:1, 6, 10 [x2], 13; 5:1, 4, 12, 14, 25–27). Compare </p>
<p>this to Galatians where adelphos appears only four times (Gal 5:11, 13; 6:1, 18, 21, 23). </p>
<p>51. Note how Joseph Hellerman explains that in the Roman world the sibling rela-</p>
<p>tionship was the strongest relationship in existence, even stronger than husband-wife or </p>
<p>parent-child. Hellerman argues that one entailment of making this theological sibling-</p>
<p>ship association would be that fellow believers would not ght for honor against each </p>
<p>other, because siblings do not compete with each other for honor (see Hellerman 2009: </p>
<p>15–25).</p>
