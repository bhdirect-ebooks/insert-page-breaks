<p>anksgiving for the essalonians (1 ess 1:1–10) 44</p>
<p>homeless child lying on the ground half-dead. eir heart goes out to the </p>
<p>child and they rush over and carefully scoop her up and nd her care, later </p>
<p>adopting her into their family. ey were not forced to shelter her, but they </p>
<p>went out of their way to rescue her and she becomes precious, one-of-a-</p>
<p>kind, an object selected through persistent attention and interest. No doubt, </p>
<p>in the midst of their trials and tribulations, the essalonians felt ignored </p>
<p>by God. Perhaps they felt rejected. Paul responds tenderly: he chose you </p>
<p>then, he loves you now.</p>
<p>We see a parallel in Isaiah 44 in view of Yahweh’s care for Israel. In </p>
<p>the prior chapter, Yahweh reminded Israel that her exilic state was not an </p>
<p>accident, but the result of a heritage of rebellion against God’s commands </p>
<p>and counsel. However, rejection on God’s part was not to be the last word.</p>
<p>But now listen, Jacob my servant; and Israel whom I have chosen: </p>
<p>this is what the Lord God who made you says, the one who formed </p>
<p>you in the womb; your rescue is yet to come, do not be afraid, my </p>
<p>servant Jacob, my beloved Israel, the one I have chosen. (Isa 44:1–2) </p>
<p>How does Paul know that the essalonians should be condent and </p>
<p>secure in their identity in God (especially as beloved and precious)? In 1:5 </p>
<p>he reminds them of their reception of the message of the good news. It was </p>
<p>not merely an exchange of words, but the presence and power of God was </p>
<p>profoundly felt. Paul refers to the gospel coming, literally, “in power and in </p>
<p>the Holy Spirit.” is is probably a hendiadys best translated “in a powerful </p>
<p>way through the Holy Spirit.” Paul, here, is repeating his remembrance mo-</p>
<p>tif, prompting the essalonians to look back to the memorable happenings </p>
<p>of their initial conversion. Probably Paul is referring to the manifestation of </p>
<p>“signs and wonders” (miracles) at that time (see Rom 15:13, 19), but he may </p>
<p>also have in mind their positive reaction to the good news.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Apparently</p>
<p>that was enough to give them “deep conviction” that the gospel message </p>
<p>was reliable and trustworthy.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>ey also had the example of Paul and his</p>
<p>associates as additional testimony to the reliability of the good news.</p>
<p>8. See Twelree 2013: 180–87.</p>
<p>9. e early Christian letter called 1 Clement uses this same language of “deep </p>
<p>conviction” in reference to the proof supplied by the resurrection of Jesus that supported </p>
<p>them along with the presence and power of the Holy Spirit (42.3). ere is some debate </p>
<p>over whether the “deep conviction” was on the part of the essalonians (in their ac-</p>
<p>ceptance of the good-news message) or on the part of the apostles (who preached with </p>
<p>boldness and assurance from God). My own inclination is to see it as the former, in </p>
<p>agreement with Bruce 1982: 14.</p>
