<p>Perseverance and Hope (2 ess 2:1–17) 137</p>
<p>e restrainer holds back the full presence of the Lawless One.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>Paul makes</p>
<p>it a point to identify the present operation of lawlessness not to scare the </p>
<p>essalonians, but rather because he did not want the delineation of an </p>
<p>eschatological timeline to give them the wrong impression. Just because </p>
<p>the Lawless One is not fully “at-large” does not mean that the essalonian </p>
<p>believers can rest on their laurels. On the contrary, Satan and his minions </p>
<p>are presently active. Vigilance is required.</p>
<p>is whole passage (2:3–12) comes to an important climax in 2:8, </p>
<p>where Paul rst notes the unveiling of the Lawless One, the great villain of </p>
<p>the story, the beast that is expected to rampage and ruin. But no sooner has </p>
<p>Paul made mention of the Lawless One than he immediately turns the at-</p>
<p>tention of the essalonians to “the Lord Jesus.” Paul refers to the “appear-</p>
<p>ance of his presence” (tē epiphaneia tēs parousias autou); this may seem like </p>
<p>a redundancy because Paul could have simply referred to Jesus’ presence </p>
<p>(Parousia) as he does in 1 essalonians (1:10; 4:16). However, the addition </p>
<p>of the word epiphaneia (appearance) seems to be signicant. ere appears </p>
<p>to be an emphasis on the brilliance and splendor of the presence of Jesus. </p>
<p>e term epiphaneia was sometimes used in reference to “any conspicuous </p>
<p>intervention on the part of higher powers.”</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>In Jewish tradition, one could</p>
<p>implore God to reveal himself to save them.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e very appearance (epiphaneia) of Jesus is enough to abolish the </p>
<p>Lawless One, but Paul adds that Jesus will slay him by the breath of his </p>
<p>mouth. According to the Old Testament, the “word of the Lord” is uniquely </p>
<p>powerful: “By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and all their </p>
<p>host by the breath of his mouth” (Ps 33:6). e book of Isaiah contains the </p>
<p>most striking imagery regarding the judging-breath of God. Regarding the </p>
<p>judgment of Assyria, we read that the “breath of the Lord” sets ablaze the </p>
<p>funeral pyre of the Assyrian king (Isa 30:33; cf. 40:7). e most important </p>
<p>passage in Isaiah for our understanding of 2 ess 2:8, though, comes in </p>
<p>28. So Shogren’s paraphrase: “lawlessness is already at work, but forced to operate in </p>
<p>part as a mystery or as it were ‘underground’ until God takes the restraint out of its way” </p>
<p>(2012: 286).</p>
<p>29. See M-M 2015; also Trebilco 2013: 25–48, at 44–46.</p>
<p>30. See 3 Maccabees where a helpless band of Jews cry out to God “imploring the </p>
<p>Ruler over every power to manifest (epiphaneia) himself and be merciful to them, as </p>
<p>they stood now at the gates of death” (5:51). At the very nadir of their despair, “the most </p>
<p>glorious, almighty, and true God revealed his holy face and opened the heavenly gates, </p>
<p>from which two glorious angels of fearful aspect descended, visible to all but the Jews. </p>
<p>ey opposed the forces of the enemy and lled them with confusion and terror, binding </p>
<p>them with immovable shackles” (6:18–19).</p>
