<p>Exhortation to Persevere and Grow in Holiness, Love, and Integrity 79</p>
<p>is no wonder that the early Christians had to give new believers directed </p>
<p>and repeated teaching about self-control and purity.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>For example, the early</p>
<p>Christian training manual called the Didache (“e Teaching of the Twelve </p>
<p>Apostles to the Gentiles”), dating perhaps even to the rst century AD, im-</p>
<p>presses upon the readers the need for everyday purity: “Abstain from eshly </p>
<p>and worldly lusts” (1:4); “thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not </p>
<p>commit paederasty, thou shalt not practice fornication” (2:2); “My child, be </p>
<p>not a lustful one; for lust leadeth the way to fornication” (3:3); “e way of </p>
<p>death is this: . . . adulteries, lusts, fornications . . . ” (5:1). </p>
<p>Excursus: Sexual Immorality in the Greco-Roman World</p>
<p>The world in which Paul lived offered men a number of sexual opportunities </p>
<p>and “privileges,” even for those that were married. F. F. Bruce explains it in </p>
<p>this way:</p>
<p>A man might have a mistress [hetaera] who could provide him also </p>
<p>with intellectual companionship; the institution of slavery made it </p>
<p>easy for him to have a concubine [pallak</p>
<p>ē</p>
<p>], while casual gratiﬁca-</p>
<p>tion was readily available from a harlot [porn</p>
<p>ē</p>
<p>]. The function of </p>
<p>his wife was to manage his household and be the mother of his </p>
<p>legitimate children and heirs. There was no body of public opinion </p>
<p>to discourage porneia [sexual immorality], although someone who </p>
<p>indulged in it to excess might be satirized on the same level as a </p>
<p>notorious glutton or drunkard. The general attitude is frequently </p>
<p>illustrated by a quotation from Demosthenes’s oration Against </p>
<p>Neaera: “We keep mistresses for pleasure, concubines for our </p>
<p>day-to-day bodily needs, but we have wives to produce legitimate </p>
<p>children and serve as trustworthy guardians of our homes.”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Roman poet Horace (65 BC–27 BC) conﬁrms just this sort of sexual license </p>
<p>in Roman society:</p>
<p>If your groin is swelling,</p>
<p>and a housemaid or a slave boy is at hand,</p>
<p>arousing constant desire,</p>
<p>do you prefer to burst with tension?</p>
<p>Not me: I enjoy love that is available and easy.</p>
