<p>Mission and Community (2 ess 3:1–18) 149</p>
<p>Another theory, recently championed by Gary Shogren, is that some </p>
<p>essalonians set themselves up as local leaders in the church and tried to </p>
<p>claim a unique right of exemption from labor for the sake of leadership. </p>
<p>As such, they desired support from the essalonians. Shogren explains, </p>
<p>“they are not lazy and perhaps are very busy; but they do not have gainful </p>
<p>employment, and they are proving to be disruptive.”</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>While any of these</p>
<p>views struggle with lack of clear evidence, the third view is most convinc-</p>
<p>ing. Firstly, it would account for Paul commanding the church to set these </p>
<p>meddlers at a distance (3:6). Secondly, it ts as an anti-type for how Paul </p>
<p>establishes his own policy of forsaking his right to accept their nancial </p>
<p>support (see 2 ess 3:9; 1 Cor 9). Finally, we may have an early Christian </p>
<p>warning along these lines that makes this sort of problem more explicit. </p>
<p>e Didache oers this counsel:</p>
<p>Act toward the apostles and prophets as the gospel decrees. Let </p>
<p>every apostle who comes to you be welcomed as the Lord. But </p>
<p>he should not remain more than a day. If he must, he may stay </p>
<p>one more. But if he stays three days, he is a false prophet. When </p>
<p>an apostles leaves, he should take nothing except bread, until he </p>
<p>arrives at his night’s lodging. If he asks for money, he is a false </p>
<p>prophet (11:3–6)</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Reecting on the situation in 2 essalonians, David deSilva wonders </p>
<p>whether the Didache may be addressing a similar situation when it “oers </p>
<p>regulations to cut down on the abuses of local church support by wandering </p>
<p>spiritualists. ey might have been the self-appointed spiritual directors of </p>
<p>the community who gave up their mundane occupations to devote them-</p>
<p>selves full-time to regulating the lives (i.e., meddling, being busybodies) of </p>
<p>their less spiritual brothers and sisters.”</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Turning now to the text of 2 ess 3:6–15, we can imagine how this </p>
<p>third approach might work. Paul begins, in 3:6, by commanding the es-</p>
<p>salonians to put these idle troublemakers at a distance because they have </p>
<p>attach themselves to someone higher up on the ladder of success (“patrons”) and request </p>
<p>from them money and privileges. Some scholars hypothesize that failing to work and </p>
<p>relying on patronage was a practice Paul frowned upon and it may have been a problem </p>
<p>in essalonica; see Winter 1989: 303–15.</p>
<p>15. Shogren 2012: 335.</p>
<p>16. Translation from Powell 2009: 394. e Didache is an early Christian text that </p>
<p>probably came into existence in the late rst century or early second century AD.</p>
<p>17. deSilva mentions this as one possibility, but does not commit to this theory (see </p>
<p>2004: 549).</p>
