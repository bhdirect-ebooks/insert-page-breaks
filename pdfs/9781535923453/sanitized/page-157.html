<p>doing and will go on doing the things which we command. </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>May </p>
<p>the Lord guide your hearts to the love of God and to the steadfast-</p>
<p>ness of the Messiah. </p>
<p>At the beginning of this chapter, Paul (with Silas and Timothy) requests </p>
<p>prayer for their apostolic work, specically that the “word of the Lord” (ho </p>
<p>logos tou kuriou) would sprint forward with the nal goal that the gospel of </p>
<p>Messiah Jesus might be honored and gloried throughout the world (3:1; </p>
<p>cf. Matt 24:14; Mark 16:15). e rst thing to note here is that Paul humbly </p>
<p>asks for prayer; as Leon Morris aptly notes, “He did not feel himself as high </p>
<p>above them, but as one with them. He valued their intercessions and sought </p>
<p>their prayers.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Also, in the midst of all the persecution and suering the essalo-</p>
<p>nians were facing, Paul was undoubtedly reminding them that they are not </p>
<p>powerless. Despite the plots and schemes of wicked and evil people (wheth-</p>
<p>er subverting Paul or troubling the essalonians), the people who follow </p>
<p>Jesus can rely on the strength of God through prayer in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Who are the “wicked and evil people” that apparently seek to impede </p>
<p>Paul’s ministry and from whom he needs to be delivered (3:2b)? If Paul was </p>
<p>writing this letter from Corinth, than this would probably be the context </p>
<p>from which his concerns arise. According to Acts 18:5–17, Paul was fac-</p>
<p>ing Jewish opposition in Corinth (see also 1 ess 2:14–16).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Perhaps the</p>
<p>essalonians were experiencing similar kinds of persecution from certain </p>
<p>upset Jews in essalonica and, in that case, Paul was showing a sense of </p>
<p>solidarity with their own struggle.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Paul qualies the wickedness of these</p>
<p>opponents by explaining that “loyalty” does not belong to everyone (3:2c). </p>
<p>Here Paul uses pistis (oen translated “faith”) in an absolute sense, imply-</p>
<p>ing trust in Jesus or trust in the gospel. is is similar to “faith” language </p>
<p>in Galatians where Paul could simply refer to “the pistis” he once tried to </p>
<p>destroy (Gal 1:23), living by pistis (2:20), the coming of pistis (3:23, 25), and </p>
<p>the family of pistis (6:10). When it came to the nature of Torah, the Law of </p>
<p>Moses, Paul told the Galatians that the Law is not “from pistis” (3:12). It </p>

<p>3. Furthermore, in terms of Jewish opposition, note the similar language in Romans </p>
<p>15:30–31: “I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love </p>
<p>of the Spirit, to join me in earnest prayer to God on my behalf, that I may be rescued from </p>
<p>the unbelievers in Judea . . .” See Malherbe 2000: 444.</p>
