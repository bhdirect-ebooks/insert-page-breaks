<p>Introduction 19</p>
<p>without blemish (see Lev 1–9; Num 28–29). e same is used in the New </p>
<p>Testament of Jesus, a lamb “without defect or blemish” (1 Peter 1:18); and, </p>
<p>again, the same is used to characterize believers (Eph 5:27).</p>
<p>One of Paul’s favorite ways to refer to believers is “saints” or “holy </p>
<p>people”—typically he begins his letters addressing his churches with this </p>
<p>label (so 1 Cor 1:1–2). ough he does not use this title in 1 essalonians, </p>
<p>he does refer several times to the importance of their becoming holy in </p>
<p>view of the return of the Messiah (see 3:13; 5:23). In 4:3, he summarizes </p>
<p>God’s will for them as hagiasmos, “consecration” (oen translated “sancti-</p>
<p>cation”). As James omson notes, while it would not have seemed strange </p>
<p>to Gentiles to relate religion to purity or holiness, “Paul extends the sphere </p>
<p>of holiness from the cult to include aspects of daily life, including sexual </p>
<p>relationships.”</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>Both of the two wish-prayers in 1 essalonians (3:13; 5:23) use holi-</p>
<p>ness language in relation to the presentation of the essalonians before </p>
<p>God at the return of Jesus, such that it is almost as if they will be oered as </p>
<p>a living sacrice then. Paul sees it as his pastoral duty to prepare this escha-</p>
<p>tological oering, and he is particularly anxious that this sacrice is perfect. </p>
<p>is would make sense in light of Rom 15:16 where Paul portrays himself </p>
<p>as an apostle-priest responsible for the oering of the Gentiles such that </p>
<p>they may be “acceptable, sanctied by the Holy Spirit.”</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>Ultimately, Paul’s</p>
<p>use of cult language (holiness, purity, sacrice) has to do with his under-</p>
<p>standing that believers owe their whole life in dedication and service to the </p>
<p>redeeming God. Paul’s emphasis on the day of reckoning in this letter is not </p>
<p>meant as a threat (which would stand at cross-purposes with his desire to </p>
<p>comfort them), but as an indicator of the will of the One who truly matters. </p>
<p>Military</p>
<p>ough it explicitly appears only briey, mention should also be made of </p>
<p>Paul’s use of a military image: “Since we belong to the day, let us be sober, </p>
<p>and put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of </p>
<p>salvation” (5:8). Paul was clearly encouraging them to close ranks, as it were, </p>
<p>and be vigilant in the face of opposition. Occasionally in his letters Paul did </p>
<p>use war metaphors (Rom 13:12; 2 Cor 6:7; 10:4; cf. Eph 6:11–17). He wished </p>
<p>to represent the present time as one of opposition against evil—hence his </p>
