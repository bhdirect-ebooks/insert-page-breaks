<p>ing even more persecution. Furthermore, they appear to need teaching on </p>
<p>how things will happen and turn out at the Lord’s impending intervention. </p>
<p>David deSilva summarizes aptly the probable situation that gave rise to this </p>
<p>second letter to the essalonians.</p>
<p>e believers had made some positive progress in the direction </p>
<p>that 1 essalonians has urged them, as Paul arms their growing </p>
<p>mutual love and the steadfastness of their faith. Relationships with </p>
<p>the community are suciently strong and have become sucient-</p>
<p>ly primary for most members that Paul believes the Christians </p>
<p>can now use shaming and shunning within the group to reinforce </p>
<p>certain believers (2 ess 3:14–15). Nevertheless, the pressures </p>
<p>from outside the group continue to demand Paul’s attention—he </p>
<p>continues to encourage the Christians to resist that pressure.</p>
<p>A second issue revolves around a misunderstanding of Chris-</p>
<p>tian eschatology, thinking that “the Day of the Lord has arrived” </p>
<p>(2 ess 2:2). Indeed, it is possible that such a misunderstanding </p>
<p>arose from the discussion of 1 ess 5:1–11 and perhaps from </p>
<p>some glossing of the copy or copies of that letter circulating among </p>
<p>the other house churches in essalonica. Finally, the “idle” or </p>
<p>“disorderly” (ataktoi) of 1 ess 5:14 emerge here as a more evi-</p>
<p>dent problem requiring the believers’ direct intervention (2 ess </p>
<p>3:6–15).</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Persecution</p>
<p>In the rst letter, Paul takes the role of comforter and encourager to those </p>
<p>essalonians who face opposition. In the second letter, Paul’s tone is more </p>
<p>serious, and he emphasizes not only future relief for these beleaguered be-</p>
<p>lievers, but also inevitable judgment upon the persecutors.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>Eschatology</p>
<p>e second chapter of 2 essalonians appears to comprise the main teach-</p>
<p>ing that Paul wanted to pass on. Apparently somehow the essalonians </p>
<p>came to believe that the “Day of the Lord” arrived.</p>
<p>letter must have been written not long aer the rst; it must have been written before </p>
<p>Paul’s visit narrated in Acts 20; see Morris 1975: 30. </p>
