<p>e Hopeful Fate of the Christian Dead (1 ess 4:13–18) 94</p>
<p>e mood of the apocalyptic imagination was born in this kind of context </p>
<p>where Israel began to hope for a dynamic, cataclysmic act of God on their </p>
<p>behalf, protecting and restoring them (not least from their sin), and pun-</p>
<p>ishing and destroying their enemies. While there are some disagreements </p>
<p>among scholars about how the term “apocalyptic” should be used and what </p>
<p>its essential components are, many scholars nd an “apocalyptic” perspec-</p>
<p>tive/worldview to have the following six elements.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Cosmology. e “world” is not just material molecules in motion, </p>
<p>not just a world of human work and wars and food and drink. </p>
<p>Rather, there is a much larger stage where “players” at work in-</p>
<p>clude demons and angels and all kinds of forces of good and evil </p>
<p>that are not detectable to the naked eye. Apocalypticists are atten-</p>
<p>tive to such goings on (Rom 16:20; 2 Cor 2:11; cf. Eph 6:11). We </p>
<p>see this in 1 essalonians when Paul refers to the voice of the </p>
<p>“archangel” (4:16).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Revelation. e word “apocalyptic” comes directly from the Greek </p>
<p>word apokalypsis which means “revelation” or “disclosure.” An </p>
<p>“apocalypse” is a writing (at home within early Judaism) where a </p>
<p>“seer” typically has his eyes opened in visions or dreams to the op-</p>
<p>erations of an unseen world and to important events yet to come. </p>
<p>I am convinced that this “revelatory” aspect accounts for Paul’s </p>
<p>appeal to the “word of the Lord” (1 ess 4:15; see 96–99).</p>
Eschatology. As noted above, one key purpose of divine revelation
<p>for a seer is knowledge of signicant future events, in the case of </p>
<p>Paul the information about the return of the Messiah found in </p>
<p>4:15–17 underscoring the priority of the resurrection of “the dead </p>
<p>in the Messiah” and the sure hope that all believers will be together </p>
<p>with the Lord Messiah Jesus henceforth.</p>
<p>Dualism and Conict. Most apocalyptic texts (like Daniel [esp. </p>
<p>chs. 2, 7–12] and Revelation) narrate a kind of good-versus-evil </p>
<p>battle (or battles). is is absent from 1 ess 4:15–17, but prob-</p>
<p>ably because Paul’s focus is specically on the fate of the recently </p>
<p>deceased.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>11. e following categories are of my own making, but are inuenced largely by </p>
<p>Aune 1993: 25–35; Murphy 2002: 127–66; see also Collins 1998: 264–68.</p>
<p>12. e only other appearance in the New Testament of the word “archangel” (arch-</p>
<p>angelos) is Jude 9 which specically mentions the angel Michael.</p>
<p>13. Note, however, 2 ess 1:8–9; 2:8.</p>
