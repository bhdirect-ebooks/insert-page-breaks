<p>Introduction 31</p>
<p>2 ess 3:16). Additionally, both letters use the same rare word kateuthy-</p>
<p>nai, although in dierent contexts (1 ess 3:11; 2 ess 3:16). Krentz’s </p>
<p>point here is not to show similarities, but rather what seems like copying </p>
<p>or a conscious dependence on the rst letter. is leads to the natural ques-</p>
<p>tion, “Why would Paul copy himself in this almost mechanical way?”</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>implication is that Paul would have no need to copy himself, but this is </p>
<p>the kind of thing that a pseudonymous writer would do, having 1 es-</p>
<p>salonians in his possession and wanting to create another letter that appears </p>
<p>Pauline.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>Style</p>
<p>Every writer has his or her own writing personality or style. One person </p>
<p>(today) says “you know?” at the end of a sentence, while another says “you </p>
<p>know what I mean?” Some scholars, examining the “styles” of 1 and 2 es-</p>
<p>salonians, note a dierence.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>Second essalonians employs certain turns</p>
<p>of phrases (such as “good hope” and “eternal comfort”) that don’t resonate </p>
<p>with the style of Paul’s other undisputed letters (like 1 essalonians, but </p>
<p>also Galatians, Romans, 1–2 Corinthians, Philippians, and Philemon).</p>
<p>83</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another possible dierence in style is the author of 2 essalonians’ prefer-</p>
<p>ence for longer and more complex sentences.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>Christina Kreinecker has</p>
argued recently that 2 essalonians diverges from 1 essalonians in the
<p>way that the author makes requests (using the verbs erōtaō and parangelō).</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>Historical Implausibility</p>
<p>A third matter involves the discovery of features of a text that simply do </p>
<p>not t into the timeline of a historical Paul. For example, some scholars </p>
<p>have noted the two appeals to “tradition” in 2 essalonians (2:15; 3:6)—is </p>
<p>80. e question is raised by Raymond Brown, 1997: 592. Other scholars who point </p>
<p>to this phenomenon as an indicator of pseudonymous dependence include Richard </p>
<p>1995: 21; Esler 2001: 1213.</p>
<p>81. So Bailey reasons: “it is impossible to conceive of a man as creative as Paul draw-</p>
<p>ing upon his own previous letter in such an unimaginative way” (1978–1979: 136); as </p>
<p>cited in Still 1999: 51.</p>
