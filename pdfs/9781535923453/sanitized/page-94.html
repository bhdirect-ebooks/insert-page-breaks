<p>Exhortation to Persevere and Grow in Holiness, Love, and Integrity82</p>
<p>(Rom 6:12; cf. 1 Pet 2:11). Because of the bondage-breaking power of God, </p>
<p>one can “put on the Lord Messiah Jesus,” as it were, and his power can </p>
<p>enable believers to “make no provision for the esh, to gratify its desires” </p>
<p>(Rom 13:14). is is not automatic. It is a choice—a daily, hourly choice to </p>
<p>let Jesus rule and to live according to the Spirit (Gal 5:16). It is not a mat-</p>
<p>ter of pure will-power, but the believer must fully assimilate the idea that </p>
<p>“those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucied the esh with its passions </p>
<p>and desires” (Gal 5:24).</p>
<p>e choice to indulge in sexual vices, to degrade the body with lust </p>
<p>and promiscuity, is not a symbol of freedom—just the opposite; it is a mark </p>
<p>of imprisonment (see Rom 1:18–32). Inversely, holiness is not a barrier or </p>
<p>restriction, but true freedom in God. Controlling one’s body is not a pro-</p>
<p>hibitive rule, but a natural corollary of one’s honor (4:4) or value in God. </p>
<p>What many Christians lack today is a deep sense of self-worth or dignity. </p>
<p>Believers will have a mature sense of dignity when they truly understand </p>
<p>their incalculable worth to God. It actually degrades the sacrice of Jesus </p>
<p>when we do not ascribe worth and value to ourselves. If we put value in </p>
<p>his giving of his life, such “worth” is ascribed to us for whom he gave that </p>
<p>blood. Paul wants each believer to weigh his or her own body on the scale </p>
<p>of worth in God’s perspective and to treat that commodity in a way com-</p>
<p>mensurate with what God has invested in it through Messiah Jesus.</p>
<p>In 4:5, Paul draws a sharp qualitative distinction between the essa-</p>
<p>lonian believers’ lifestyle and that of “the Gentiles who do not know God.” </p>
<p>Almost certainly the essalonian believers themselves were not ethnically </p>
<p>Jews (and, thus, they were Gentiles, “non-Jews”), so how can he tell Gen-</p>
<p>tiles not to act like Gentiles? It could be that Paul is comparing “Gentiles </p>
<p>who do not know God” with “Gentiles who do know God.” But I think </p>
<p>Paul’s thought runs deeper than this point. e idea is that they have been </p>
<p>written into a new story through Jesus, the story of Israel; they do not liter-</p>
<p>ally become “Jews,” but they are adopted into the family of Yahweh through </p>
<p>Jesus and they live out a dierent set of values (see Rom 11:17).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Furthermore, Paul seems to draw from a common Jewish criticism </p>
<p>of Gentiles who are “godless” despite having many idols, and their state of </p>
<p>16. Notice in 1 Corinthians, Paul also corresponds with a church composed mostly </p>
<p>of Gentiles and he writes to them in regards to lessons learned from the Israelite wilder-</p>
<p>ness period that “our ancestors were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea” </p>
<p>(1 Cor 10:1; NRSV). As Richard Hays explains, “the story of Israel is for the Gentile </p>
<p>Corinthians not somebody else’s story; it is the story of their own authentic spiritual </p>
<p>ancestors” (Hays 1997: 160); see also Garroway 2012.</p>
