<p>Introduction 29</p>
<p>vision to see how what they are doing—in loving and caring for one an-</p>
<p>other and others despite this opposition—was adding to their future glory </p>
<p>and that they would be vindicated and honored in the end. </p>
<p>Justice and Peace</p>
<p>Related to the concern about dignity, Paul also seeks to handle the inevi-</p>
<p>table question that comes to those who suer—is God fair (theodicy)? Can </p>
<p>God be trusted to do what it right? Why does he keep silent and invisible? </p>
<p>What have I done such that he won’t rescue me? </p>
<p>Paul responds to the essalonians’ suering by pointing to a future </p>
<p>hope—God will rebalance the world at the right time. While it is dicult to </p>
<p>wait for that right time, it is sure and he can be trusted to work it all out.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Suering and wrath are not ultimate things, they are penultimate things. </p>
<p>I would like to echo here the point Michael Gorman makes in relation to </p>
<p>judgment language in the book of Revelation:</p>
<p>Revelation’s visions of judgment symbolize God’s penultimate </p>
<p>(next-to-last) rather than ultimate (nal) activity in human his-</p>
<p>tory. at is, judgment is a means to an end; the goal being escha-</p>
<p>tological salvation, the creation of a new heaven and new earth in </p>
<p>which humanity realizes its true raison d’etre as reconciled peoples </p>
<p>ourishing together in the presence of God and the Lamb.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Much the same could be said of 2 essalonians. All the apocalyp-</p>
<p>tic turmoil that Paul prescribes is far from the end-vision of salvation and </p>
<p>God’s redeeming justice. Despite what looks like eschatological chaos, the </p>
<p>ultimate hope is harmony. us, Justice in 2 essalonians should be joined </p>
<p>by his brother Peace.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> Paul’s ultimate interest in peace (eirēnē) is demon-</p>
<p>strated in how he ends this letter: “Now may the Lord of peace himself give </p>
<p>you peace at all times in all ways. e Lord be with all of you.” Peace is not </p>
<p>only what will exist in the end, when the apocalyptic dust has settled. Be-</p>
<p>lievers can embody and live out lives of peace-making and peace-keeping </p>
<p>now.</p>
