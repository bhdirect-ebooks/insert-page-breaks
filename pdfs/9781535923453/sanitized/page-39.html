<p>Introduction 27</p>
<p>• ere will be a great enemy that is characterized by disobedience to </p>
<p>God (the Lawless One) (2:3–4); he serves under Satan and will deceive </p>
<p>others through miracles (2:9–10)</p>
<p>• God has allowed there to be a “restrainer” to hold back the Lawless </p>
<p>One (2:6–8)</p>
<p>• Despite how harrowing these happenings will be, the Lord Jesus will </p>
<p>destroy the Lawless One eortlessly when he returns (2:8) </p>
<p>ere are some similarities between Paul’s teaching here and Jesus’ </p>
<p>eschatological discourse in Matthew 24. Jesus explains that deceivers will </p>
<p>come (24:4–5), wars and disasters will multiply (24:6–8), persecution will </p>
<p>intensify (24:9), apostasy and betrayal will mar the church (24:10), false </p>
<p>prophets will mislead (24:11), lawlessness will corrupt love (24:12)—but the </p>
<p>one who endures to the end will be saved (24:13). </p>
<p>So also Paul says: We are thankful for you, beloved essalonians, be-</p>
<p>cause you are the “rst-fruits” of essalonica, and you have held fast to the </p>
<p>truth. Glory will come. Stand rm (2:13–15). Paul narrates the future, not to </p>
<p>assuage curiosities, nor even to diuse panic, but to demonstrate the losing </p>
<p>side is going to lose—not because it is weaker per se, but because ultimately </p>
<p>it is lawless and wicked. If the essalonians have become confused about </p>
<p>which side to stand on to survive the coming wrath, Paul oers an impor-</p>
<p>tant clue—follow the obedient and righteous ones. </p>
<p>(No) Work</p>
<p>A third important issue that Paul handles is that of a group he calls the “idle </p>
<p>troublemakers” (3:6–12). Already in 1 essalonians he warns the idle (1 </p>
<p>ess 5:14), but in this letter the problem with them seems to have wors-</p>
<p>ened such that his rebuke is stern. It is possible that, in a state of emergency </p>
<p>and discernment in the church in light of what seems like apocalyptic signs, </p>
<p>some local leaders “dubbed” themselves spiritual leaders (perhaps imitat-</p>
<p>ing the authority of Paul). ey are rebellious insofar as they undermine </p>
<p>the community life by being mere “busybodies”—people who meddle and </p>
<p>ponticate, but get nothing done (2 ess 3:11). ey disrupt the produc-</p>
<p>tive, daily life of the community and they ignore the teachings Paul passed </p>
<p>on to the essalonians. </p>
<p>Paul seeks to distance himself and the church from these troublemak-</p>
<p>ers by rst pointing out his own habit of working for a living. Paul did not </p>
