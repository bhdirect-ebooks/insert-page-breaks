<p>Paul explains in Colossians that the Father “rescued us from the power of </p>
<p>darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son” (1:13 </p>
<p>AT). is is precisely the sentiment carried by the statement in 1 ess </p>
<p>1:1—this is who you are, this is where you are, you belong with God and </p>
<p>Jesus and they have made a home for you.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>It becomes clear very early on</p>
<p>in the letter that the essalonians are facing many burdens, worries, and </p>
<p>aictions, and Paul’s reminder to them that they have been relocated, as it </p>
<p>were, into the realm or domain of God and Jesus supplies a kind of identity-</p>
<p>anchor on the stormy sea of life.</p>
<p>Here he adds too his wish for God’s “grace and peace” to them. is </p>
<p>is a typical kind of well-wish for a letter of his time, but these are two very </p>
<p>important words for Paul theologically. It is not simply a nice sentiment </p>
<p>from Paul, but a mark of the ongoing, out-owing work of the gospel of </p>
<p>Jesus the Messiah where he ever has more favor</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>to bestow. Keep in mind</p>
<p>that in chapter ve he warns them not to be naïve, embracing cheap oers </p>
<p>of “peace and security” from the world (5:3). When Paul conveys words of </p>
<p>peace, it is a deeper kind than the world can oer, just as Jesus said, “Peace </p>
<p>I leave with you; my peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world </p>
<p>gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled, and do not let them be afraid” </p>
<p>(John 14:27). As Jesus comforted his disciples, so Paul his converts—Je-</p>
<p>sus “released” his peace and le it for his followers; Paul oers it to the </p>
<p>essalonians.</p>

<p>We always thank God for all of you whenever we remember you </p>
<p>in our prayers. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>In particular we continually remember in prayer </p>
<p>before our God and Father your loyalty that works, your love that </p>
<p>labors, and your endurance driven by hope in our Lord Messiah </p>
<p>Jesus. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>And we know, my dear brothers and sisters, who are loved </p>
<p>by God, that God chose you, </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>because our good news did not </p>
<p>come to you as a message only, but it also came in a powerful way </p>
<p>through the Holy Spirit and deep conviction, just as you know </p>
<p>what kind of people we became when we were with you for your </p>
<p>2. e collocation of “God the Father” and “the Lord Messiah Jesus” is critical for </p>
<p>Paul’s Christology. As F. F. Bruce explains, this demonstrates “the exalted place which </p>
<p>the risen Christ occupies in the thoughts of Paul and his colleagues”; see Bruce 1982: 7.</p>
<p>3. “Favor,” or generosity, is another way to translate the Greek word charis; see </p>
<p>Barclay 2015.</p>
