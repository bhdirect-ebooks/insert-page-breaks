<p>Exhortation to Persevere and Grow in Holiness, Love, and Integrity78</p>
<p>But Paul’s purpose in writing is not purely to oer reassurance and </p>
<p>comfort. He also writes to them to remind them of God’s expectations for </p>
<p>their lifestyle and behavior. It is important for them to know that God has </p>
<p>called them into his “glorious kingdom” (2:12), but this “calling” is also </p>
<p>a privilege, a lifelong response and responsibility. ey are called to live </p>
<p>according to kingdom standards. e constitution of their kingdom citi-</p>
<p>zenship requires holiness, not impurity (4:7). ree main topics are treated </p>
<p>in this early section of chapter four: holiness (4:1–8), love (4:9–10), and </p>
<p>integrity (4:11–12).</p>
<p>God’s Call to Holiness (4:1–8)</p>
<p>Paul begins this section by reminding the essalonians (through the au-</p>
<p>thority of the Lord Jesus) about the teaching that they had already received </p>
<p>from him (4:1). When he originally instructed them, he shared not simply </p>
<p>the good-news message, but also counsel regarding “how you must walk </p>
<p>and live to please God.” We sometimes call this “ethics,” but Paul would not </p>
<p>have seen a distinction between “theology” and “ethics.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>For Paul, the free</p>
<p>gi of new life in Messiah Jesus automatically entails a new set of personal </p>
<p>and social standards under the Lordship of Jesus. e idea behind “walk-</p>
<p>ing” (peripateō), a Jewish idiom, is that the religious life is lived at all times, </p>
<p>not just in temples and religious meetings (Deut 6:4–12).</p>
<p>Paul is quick to note that the essalonians are not failing in their obe-</p>
<p>dience to God—he simply wants them to keep their eyes focused on God’s </p>
<p>will and expectations (4:1–2). He goes on to refer in quite specic terms </p>
<p>to the nature of the will of God. God wishes, in particular, that they are </p>
<p>“consecrated” to him (hagiasmos). To be consecrated is to be dedicated to </p>
<p>holiness. Here Paul views holiness as a kind of maintained condition of pu-</p>
<p>rity and personal dedication to God.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Sometimes this word is explained as</p>
<p>if it were simply about not doing or being something (i.e., avoiding worldli-</p>
<p>ness), and Paul does point out here what jeopardizes holiness. However, </p>
<p>the language of holiness in Jewish thought has an important positive value. </p>
<p>Holiness involves being close to God and being available and dedicated to </p>
<p>serving God wholeheartedly.</p>

<p> Given that most of the essalonian believ-</p>
<p>ers would have been Gentiles (see 4:5), and in the Greco-Roman world at </p>
<p>large men had quite a lot of freedom to indulge their sexual passions, it </p>
