<p>anksgiving for the essalonians (1 ess 1:1–10) 45</p>
<p>e last clause of 1:5 mentions that the essalonians ought to re-</p>
<p>member “what kind of people we became when we were with you for your </p>
<p>sake.” Even if the essalonians knew what this broad statement means, it </p>
<p>is dicult for us, uninformed readers to discern. It could means that they </p>
<p>acted honestly and with integrity, as these matters are taken up in 2:1–12. </p>
<p>However, the way Paul phrases this clause, it seems that he and Silas some-</p>
<p>how went out of their way to be something or act in a way that proved </p>
<p>better for the essalonians. Two possibilities are worth considering. First, </p>
<p>he could be making reference to how he became like an infant among them </p>
<p>(2:7), someone vulnerable and without status. He makes it clear enough </p>
<p>that he and Silas had every right to assert their authority as “apostles,” but </p>
<p>they chose not to. A second option is a reference here to Paul’s work-policy </p>
<p>with them. He chose to work “night and day” so as not to burden them </p>
<p>with his nancial needs (2:9). I have a slight preference for the second op-</p>
<p>tion because it is a bit more tangible and, thus, would be easy to recall for </p>
<p>the essalonians at Paul’s mention, but in either case the point is clear: </p>
<p>the essalonians, at that time, had a crystal clear picture of God at work </p>
<p>among them in the ministry of the apostles and the work of the Spirit. How </p>
<p>easy it is to leave a mountaintop experience and begin to doubt the power </p>
<p>and truth that was so present and lucid in that moment.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Metamorphosis</p>
<p>It is hard to tell in English, but Paul repeats an important keyword in 1 </p>
<p>Thessalonians: ginomai. This verb can be translated “to come” or “to be-</p>
<p>come” based on context. Paul uses this verb twelve times in this letter, four </p>
<p>times in 1:5–7. The Thessalonians became imitators of the apostles and the </p>
<p>Lord Jesus (1:6; 2:14). And they became an example for the Macedonians </p>
<p>and Achaians (1:7). The apostles became holy and blameless among them </p>
<p>(2:10). This can make it sound like believers are always transforming into </p>
<p>something better, something more glorious. Certainly this is true in the sense </p>
<p>that Paul discusses in 2 Cor 3:18: “And all of us, with unveiled faces, seeing </p>
<p>the glory of the Lord as though reﬂected in a mirror, are being transformed into </p>
<p>the same image from one degree of glory to another, for this comes from the </p>
<p>Lord, the Spirit.” As we are gravitationally pulled into the orbit of God’s grace </p>
<p>and power, we are reshaped into the “the image of [God’s] Son” (Rom 8:29).</p>
