<p>Introduction 11</p>
<p>2:14–16 makes good sense in Paul’s argument if Paul is connecting Jewish </p>
<p>persecution in Judea to Jewish persecution in essalonica.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>My inclination is to nd a way to bring Acts 17:1–10a together with </p>
<p>what Paul writes in 1 essalonians. While the implication of 1 ess </p>
<p>1:9–10 is that the essalonian believers were largely Gentiles (forsaking </p>
<p>idol worship), it very well may be that they were Gentile god-fearers prior </p>
<p>to meeting Paul (see above, e Church in essalonica, 6–7). Again, some </p>
<p>scholars consider it incredible that Paul might assert this about Gentiles </p>
<p>who had already turned to the God of Israel.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>However, this assumption</p>
<p>is misguided. Paula Fredriksen explains that Gentiles who chose to “visit </p>
<p>with” Jews and their God felt “free to observe as much or as little of Jew-</p>
<p>ish custom as they chose—free, indeed, to continue worshiping their own </p>
<p>g o d s .”</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> Shaye Cohen makes the same case about the possibility of god-</p>
<p>fearers as polytheists, and seeks to help moderns understand how ancient </p>
<p>Greeks and Romans thought.</p>
<p>ose who see Judaism and Hellenism as discrete entities are per-</p>
<p>plexed by the phenomenon of the God-fearers. Some have even </p>
<p>questioned their existence. Aer all, how can gentiles become a </p>
<p>“little bit Jewish”? And why would they want to? e explanation </p>
<p>is to be sought in the other conception of Hellenism discussed </p>
<p>above. Many Greek and Romans adopted the gods (e.g., Isis, </p>
<p>Cybele, Mithras, Jupiter Dolichenus) and practices of various </p>
<p>“barbarian” nations without converting or losing their identity. </p>
<p>Similarly, thinking that the God of the Jews was like the god of </p>
<p>other nations, they added him to their pantheon.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e theory that I nd most plausible related to the essalonian </p>
<p>church is this: a group of Gentiles were attracted to Jewish life and became </p>
<p>political connections. ose who work with a narrower (ethnic) meaning for symphyletēs, </p>
<p>Taylor urges, are drawing from a very limited pool of occurrences. </p>
<p>35. See Donfried 2002: 200–206.</p>
<p>36. So Wanamaker: “Such a remark [in 1 ess 1:9] would seem inappropriate if the </p>
<p>majority of his Gentile converts had already turned their backs on pagan religious prac-</p>
<p>tices by aliating with the Jewish synagogue” (1990: 7).</p>
<p>37. Fredriksen 2015: 183–84. Furthermore, Fredriksen notes: “this shiing syna-</p>
<p>gogue population of interested outsiders would have provided Paul with the bulk of </p>
<p>his target audience: active pagans who were nonetheless interested to some degree in </p>
<p>the Jewish god, and who had some sort of familiarity, through listening, with the Bible” </p>
<p>(again 184–85); see also Dunn 2009: 563.</p>
