between human and divine co-participation that Paul expresses. e fact of
<p>his praying and the expectation of the mighty work of God remind us that </p>
<p>Paul relies on the Almighty to transform and change human lives. In addi-</p>
<p>tion, though, Paul clearly reminds the essalonians here that they too are </p>
<p>responsible to cooperate with the work of God in their midst, to honor and </p>
<p>glorify the Lord Jesus and live according to the standard of his kingdom. </p>
How do we hold the divine work and human responsibility together? Some
<p>have balked at the idea that humans do anything; including human agency </p>
<p>comes across to these as synergism or semi-pelagianism.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>But it would</p>
<p>seem that Paul imagines some kind of co-participatory dynamic. </p>
<p>John M. G. Barclay has attempted to develop an understanding of </p>
<p>Paul’s logic in this regard. In the rst place, Paul begins with the grace of </p>
<p>God, the gi of his power and presence in and through the Messiah and the </p>
Spirit. Becoming one with Messiah Jesus through divine grace empowers
<p>the believer to become an agent.</p>
When human and divine work are properly situated in a context of
<p>co-participation, this deconstructs any attempt to talk about agency as a </p>
<p>ratio, as if more work from one equals less from the other. Rather, Barclay </p>
<p>refers to an “entanglement of the two agencies.” When it comes to the ethi-</p>
<p>cal and active dimensions of what it means to participate in Messiah Jesus, </p>
<p>he writes this:</p>
<p>Some account must be given of the prepositions “in” and “through” </p>
<p>as well as “toward” and “with,” and there remains the puzzling pat-</p>
<p>tern of “I, yet not I.” At the very least we must speak here of a </p>
<p>transformation of the self, a refashioning of the human agent that </p>
<p>becomes capable of agency (with a freed will competent to obey or </p>
to “fall from grace”) and is embedded within the agency of divine
<p>grace.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul’s prayer is, if we follow along Barclay’s thinking, a means of grace </p>
<p>as well as a summons to growth. </p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Can Suffering for the Kingdom be a Blessing?</p>
<p>As I was spending time recently pondering how and why suffering makes one </p>
<p>worthy of the kingdom, as Paul writes in this chapter, I was struck by the </p>
<p>20. See the rich study on the subject of “synergism” by Yinger 2009: 89–106.</p>
