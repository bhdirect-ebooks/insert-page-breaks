<p>Exhortation to Persevere and Grow in Holiness, Love, and Integrity84</p>
<p>a man to gratify his urges with a married woman, lest he trespass and sin </p>
<p>against the marriage covenant of his brother. God will refuse to turn a blind </p>
<p>eye to such unholy behavior (4:6b). e calling of God is gracious, but also </p>
<p>formative—God’s people must direct their lives towards holiness, not im-</p>
<p>purity (4:7). In 4:8, Paul threatens anyone who would stubbornly reject this </p>
<p>teaching. </p>
<p>Even More Love (4:9–10)</p>
<p>Paul transitions from teaching on holiness to the subject of love (philadel-</p>
<p>phia; “sibling love”). Much as he did at the outset of this chapter, he makes </p>
<p>clear that they are not failing in this area, but perhaps need a bit of a push </p>
<p>to press on in expressing this kind of deep love for each other. So excellent </p>
<p>have they been in loving the family of faith, their love has extended out to </p>
<p>the wider region of Macedonia. </p>
<p>Excursus: “Sibling Love” (philadelphia)</p>
<p>I lived for a year near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, so the word “philadelphia” </p>
<p>sounds very commonplace to me. We must recognize, though, how truly unusu-</p>
<p>al it would have been for Paul to be so comfortable using this term for a group </p>
<p>of people that were not related biologically.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>So distinctive (and strange) was</p>
<p>the early Christian use of siblingship language that second-century Roman </p>
<p>Marcus Cornelius Fronto criticized them with these words: “They recognize </p>
<p>each other by secret marks and signs; hardly have they met when they love </p>
<p>each other, throughout the world uniting in the practice of a veritable religion </p>
<p>of lusts. Indiscriminately they call each other brother and sister, thus turning </p>
<p>even ordinary fornication into incest by the intervention of these hallowed </p>
<p>names.”</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Christian believer Minucius Felix responded to Fronto thusly: “. . .</p>
<p>it is true that we do love one another—a fact that you deplore—since we do </p>
<p>not know how to hate. Hence it is true that we do call one another brother—a </p>
<p>17. Reidar Aasgaard notes that the term was used less than a dozen times in all the </p>
<p>Greek literature of which we know before Paul’s time (Aasgaard 2004: 151).</p>
<p>18. See Octavius 8-9, in e Octavius of Marcus Minucius Felix <span class="_ _7" />1974: 123; <span class="ff4">ANF</span><span class="_ _7" />4.177.</p>
<p>It should be noted that it was unlikely that Fronto was aware of actual sexual deviance </p>
<p>amongst the Christians. Rather, Christians meeting privately in houses (and not publicly </p>
<p>in temples) probably led to the kinds of suspicions noted here.</p>
