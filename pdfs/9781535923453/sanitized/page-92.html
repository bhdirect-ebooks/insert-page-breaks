<p>Excursus: Sexual Immorality in the Greco-Roman World80</p>
<p>From Pompeii a piece of grafﬁti was discovered that reads: “If anyone’s </p>
<p>looking for tender embraces in this town, he should know that all the girls are </p>
<p>available.”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Even when observing these few examples, it is easy to see why</p>
<p>instruction regarding sexual purity was so standard in Paul’s ethical teaching.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Paul oers much the same kind of clarity regarding what dedication to </p>
<p>God entails: “that you distance yourself from sexual immorality” (4:3). is </p>
<p>advice goes beyond a simple “don’t do it.” Rather, Paul essentially counsels </p>
<p>them, “Get as far away from it as possible!” (One thinks of Joseph running </p>
<p>with haste away from the temptress in Potiphar’s household [Gen 39:12]; </p>
<p>see also below.) Too many Christians (of every generation) have desired a </p>
<p>kind of minimum-standard moral system to follow which oen results in </p>
<p>believers lining up as closely as possible to the boundary of sin, but just </p>
<p>barely on the “holy” side. is is not Paul’s mindset whatsoever. e only </p>
<p>way for believers to have real integrity is to put any hint of sin or dubious </p>
<p>behavior at a far distance. </p>
<p>e concern was not just with public witness, though that was also </p>
<p>something of which Paul was mindful (4:11–12). e immediate issue is </p>
<p>with mastery over carnal passions and lusts (4:4–5). Each one needs to </p>
<p>know how to “control his own ‘vessel’ with holiness and honor” (4:4). ere </p>
<p>is hardly another verse in Paul’s letters that has generated more debate and </p>
<p>discussion than this one.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Obviously Paul is concerned with self-control,</p>
<p>but what does he mean by “vessel” (skeuos)? is word skeuos is the normal </p>
<p>Greek word for container (see, e.g., John 19:29), but in this context it is </p>
<p>obvious that Paul is being metaphorical. </p>
<p>ree interpretive options are possible. First, it could be that the vessel </p>
<p>is the man’s wife and the text is encouraging marriage (see RSV: “to take a </p>
<p>wife for himself”).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Scholars and translators who prefer this reading argue,</p>
<p>rstly, that Paul employs a verb here (ktaomai) that is also used in a semi-</p>
<p>technical phrase “acquire a wife” (so Sirach 36.29; Ruth 4:10; Xenophon, </p>
<p>7. CIL IC 1796, trans. Berg; as cited in Elliott and Reasoner 2011: 251.</p>
<p>8. Another route into this topic is the study of sexual themes in Greek and Latin </p>
<p>Grati; see Williams 2014: 493–508.</p>
<p>9. See Still 2007: 207–19.</p>
<p>10. is interpretation is favored by Patristic interpreters such as eodore of </p>
<p>Mopsuestia and Augustine; also Frame 1912, Best 1986, Holtz 1986, Malherbe 2000, and </p>
<p>Witherington 2006; for detailed argumentation, see Yarbrough 1985.</p>
