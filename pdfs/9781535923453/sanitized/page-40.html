<p>expect the church to feed him, so these idle men should not. Paul toiled </p>
<p>day and night, even though he had the “right” to receive material benets </p>
<p>from them (3:9). Still, he wanted to model the principle, “ose unwilling </p>
<p>to work will not get to eat” (3:10 NLT). Paul wanted to underscore the value </p>
<p>of good, honest work, self-reliability. It is not that people should ignore </p>
<p>the needs of others—aer all, he wrote in his earlier letter that they should </p>
<p>devote themselves to the weak, no doubt feeding them if need be (1 ess </p>
<p>5:14). e focus here is on those who refuse to work, not those who cannot </p>
<p>work. </p>
<p>Ultimately, though, even though some believers were acting in a re-</p>
<p>bellious manner, Paul makes it a point to say that, though they ought to be </p>
<p>“shamed” (3:14), they should not be treated as enemies, but rather as erring </p>
<p>brothers (3:15). </p>
<p>emes of 2 essalonians</p>
<p>Many of the themes that appear in 1 essalonians also can be found in 2 </p>
<p>essalonians (e.g., faith/trust, love, salvation), but here we will focus on </p>
<p>two key themes particularly distinctive to 2 essalonians.</p>
<p>Dignity and Honor</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>At some point and for some reason, the essalonians were doubting their </p>
<p>sense worth and dignity. In the Greco-Roman world, the social value of </p>
<p>honor was the most important capital. Paul spends ample time in 2 essa-</p>
<p>lonians reminding them that, despite all the goings-on in their community </p>
<p>in recent days, they are people of worth and value before God. Paul can </p>
<p>give thanks for their faith and love because it is right to do so (1:3). He can </p>
<p>boast in them, they are acting with honor before God (1:4). eir suering </p>
<p>is not a sign of shame—quite the contrary. In fact, through this suering, </p>
<p>paradoxically, they are being made worthy of the kingdom of God (1:5). </p>
<p>ey can look forward, not to rejection and destruction, but rather to glori-</p>
<p>cation when the Messiah returns (1:12; 2:14). </p>
<p>It is all too easy to seek out self-value from society, and when the going </p>
<p>gets rough, it’s more comfortable to go with the grain of culture. e es-</p>
<p>salonians struggled with the pressures coming from those around them, </p>
<p>unhappy with resistance to their new faith. Paul was trying to enlarge their </p>
<p>71. See Carter 2010: 282–99, esp. 292–93.</p>
