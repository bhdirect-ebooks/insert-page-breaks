<p>e Hopeful Fate of the Christian Dead (1 ess 4:13–18) 96</p>
<p>dead in the Messiah will rise rst.” For Paul to go into such detail in 4:16–17 </p>
<p>about the fate of the Christian dead almost certainly means that the living </p>
<p>essalonian believers had concerns and questions. However, contrary to </p>
<p>the arguments of many scholars, it seems to me that more is going on than </p>
<p>simply that they are confused about whether or not the dead will be able to </p>
<p>rise again. e keyword that stands out for me is protos—“rst” (4:16). Paul </p>
<p>underscores the priority of these dead believers in the Messiah. e living </p>
<p>Christians will only go up to meet the Lord in the air aer (epeita; 4:17) the </p>
<p>dead have risen. Why is this so?</p>
<p>My own suggestion is that it has something to do with how these par-</p>
<p>ticular believers died. A handful of scholars have wondered whether it is </p>
<p>possible that a group of believers died due to persecution.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>While there is</p>
<p>no denitive evidence to support this, theoretically it could explain Paul’s </p>
<p>focus on the priority of the resurrection of those essalonians who died </p>
<p>(see Introduction, 14–15). No doubt, from their community’s perspective, </p>
<p>the sudden and traumatic death of such members of their church would </p>
<p>have brought great shame. Highlighting that these martyrs would come rst </p>
<p>in the resurrection might be Paul’s way of expressing God’s ability to rec-</p>
<p>oncile their dignity and honor. Chapter four verse seventeen has been the </p>
<p>subject of much attention because of two words: “caught up” (harpazō) and </p>
<p>“meeting” (apantēsis). As for the former, this is where we get the language </p>
<p>and idea of “the rapture” which has been popularized as an eschatologi-</p>
<p>cal idea by the Le Behind books and movies. e word “rapture” is taken </p>
<p>from a Latin translation (raptio) of the word Paul uses here for “caught up” </p>
<p>(harpazō). e idea behind “rapture” theology is that Jesus’ return (the rst </p>
<p>of two future appearances) involves a secret snatching away of believers </p>
<p>from the earth. However, nothing in Paul’s words here in 1 ess 4:17 lead </p>
<p>us to believe that the appearance of Jesus is anything but public, visible, and </p>
<p>(logos kyriou). Is Paul referring to something Jesus said during his earthly ministry, but </p>
<p>which is not recorded in the canonical gospels (see John 21:25)? Or perhaps could this </p>
<p>be the tradition behind Matt 24:30–31, but in Paul’s own words? I nd neither of these </p>
<p>options very persuasive. Rather, if we look at the patterned use of the language “word of </p>
<p>the Lord” in Scripture, it is associated with special prophetic insight. Following Victor </p>
<p>Furnish, I lean in favor of viewing this as a revelatory message from the Lord given to </p>
<p>Paul himself. is view would account for the specicity and the uniqueness of what Paul </p>
<p>writes in 4:15–17; see Furnish 2007: 104–5.</p>
