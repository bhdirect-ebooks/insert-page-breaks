<p>Introduction 33</p>
<p>return of Jesus. However, in 2 essalonians the point is the opposite. Linda </p>
<p>McKinnish Bridges oers this summary of how 2 essalonians is dier-</p>
<p>ent: “e motion slows; the action shis into low gear. e author of 2 </p>
<p>essalonians states that a series of selected events must rst take place </p>
<p>before the end. e list is long, systematic, and highly descriptive, using </p>
<p>stock imagery from the world of apocalyptic language.” She summarizes, </p>
<p>“In 1 essalonians the end is near. In 2 essalonians, however, the end is </p>
<p>way out of sight!”</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>To be fair, among those Pauline letters that scholars consider pseud-</p>
<p>onymous or deutero-pauline (Ephesians, Colossians, 2 essalonians, 1–2 </p>
<p>Timothy, Titus), it is harder to make the case for 2 essalonians than, for </p>
<p>example, 1 Timothy.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> e case made against the authenticity of 2 essalo-</p>
<p>nians does not rely on any silver bullet, but rather on cumulative evidence. </p>
<p>Now we turn to responses to the above arguments for pseudonymity as well </p>
<p>as other factors that oer support for authenticity.</p>
<p>Defending Pauline Authorship</p>
<p>What can we say in response to the copycat or mimicking dynamics of 2 </p>
<p>essalonians in comparison to 1 essalonians? Leon Morris sees the </p>
<p>dependence as a point in favor of authenticity—it is as equally likely that 2 </p>
<p>essalonians is “Paul being Paul” (so to speak) as it is that it was someone </p>
<p>else copying him.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>Howard Marshall adds that the high level of structural</p>
<p>similarity between the two letters could be explained by the short time be-</p>
<p>tween Paul’s writing.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>Gordon Fee oers his own point that, though some</p>
<p>structural elements are the same, the way that structure is lled is dierent. </p>
<p>e pseudepigrapher would have been simultaneously working in a depen-</p>
<p>dent way (borrowing skeletal features of 1 essalonians) and a creative way </p>
<p>(introducing his own ideas and arguments).</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>While the “copycat” nature of</p>
<p>2 essalonians is admittedly noticeable, it is very dicult to determine </p>
<p>89. Bridges 2008: 196.</p>
<p>90. Roose, though, explains that “German scholars almost unanimously view 2 es-</p>
<p>salonians as a pseudepigraph”; see 2006: 109n6.</p>
<p>91. Morris 1975: 23. </p>
<p>92. Marshall 1984: 30–31. G. Beale goes one step further by suggesting that Paul </p>
<p>drew heavily from 1 essalonians as a conscious strategy: “Could this not be the case </p>
<p>especially if he were trying to get them to recall the content of the rst letter?” See Beale </p>
<p>2003: 31. </p>
<p>93. Fee 2009: 239.</p>
