<p>Perseverance and Hope (2 ess 2:1–17) 133</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Don’t you remember that when I was still with you I used to </p>
<p>tell you these things? </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>And now you know what holds him back </p>
<p>from being revealed until his time comes. </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>For already the law-</p>
<p>lessness is operating in secret, but only until the one who holds it </p>
<p>back no longer blocks the way. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>And then the Lawless One will be </p>
<p>revealed, the one whom the Lord [Jesus] will slay with the breath </p>
<p>of his mouth; he will obliterate him by the spectacle of his coming.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>e coming of the Lawless One will be by the work of Satan, </p>
<p>and will happen with all kinds of demonstrations of power, and </p>
<p>deceiving signs and wonders, </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>and with all kinds of wicked de-</p>
<p>ception for those who are perishing. ey will perish because they </p>
<p>refused to love the truth and thus be saved. </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>So, on account of </p>
<p>this, God sends them a deluding inuence to make them believe </p>
<p>what is false </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>so that all may be judged who did not believe the </p>
<p>truth, but instead took please in wickedness. </p>
<p>Paul’s approach to soothing the essalonians’ eschatological distress </p>
<p>is to give them a run-down of “events yet to come.” He begins with the </p>
<p>coming of a great rebellion (2:3). But who is rebelling and against whom? </p>
<p>Because this rebellion appears to be associated with the Lawless One, it </p>
<p>would seem to imply an attack on the one God and his sovereign rule.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e human participants in the rebellion are le unstated, but it does not </p>
<p>make sense for Paul to be talking about worshippers of the one God. In the </p>
<p>context of this letter, it could be that Paul is referring to the kind of Jews </p>
<p>who attack Jesus’ followers supposing they these Jews are defending the </p>
<p>honor of God.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>In that sense, they are rebelling against their own God, but</p>
<p>unaware that it is such.</p>
<p>Associated with this rebellion is a gure Paul calls “the Lawless Man” </p>
<p>or “the Lawless One.” He appears to be more than one who disregards the </p>
<p>law/way of God; he could be better understood as the Anti-Law One. He </p>
<p>is “Anti-Law” insofar as he stands against God, his commandments, and </p>
<p>ways.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>He is also called the “the Son of Destruction.” Most scholars and</p>
<p>translators take this to mean he is destined for destruction, but it makes </p>

<p>9. is would reect the same kind of thought expressed in John 16:2: “ey will put </p>
<p>you out of the synagogues. Indeed, an hour is coming when those who kill you will think </p>
<p>that by doing so they are oering worship to God.” Again, though, it is worthwhile to be </p>
<p>reminded that Paul would not be condemning all Jews, since he himself was Jewish and </p>
<p>he loved his people. Rather, he could speak harshly against certain Jews who persecuted </p>
<p>believers-in-Jesus. See comments on 1 ess 2:14–16, pp. 61–65.</p>
