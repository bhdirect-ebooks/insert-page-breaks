<p>Fusing the Horizons: A Hospitable Community for All People</p>
<p>While 1 Thess 2:14–16 has become a controversial passage regarding Paul’s </p>
<p>statement about the “wrath of God” on non-Christian Jewish persecutors, </p>
<p>the debate has, unfortunately, masked one of Paul’s wider purposes in these </p>
<p>verses—namely, to remind the Thessalonians that these local opponents are </p>
<p>trying to prevent salvation from reaching the Gentiles. In direct contrast, the </p>
<p>new covenant community under Messiah Jesus is meant to be a fellowship </p>
<p>that is for the people. All people. The local persecutors seek to exclude. But </p>
<p>Paul wants to embrace and welcome Jew and Gentile alike.</p>
<p>Most of us in the modern world do not separate people into the catego-</p>
<p>ries of Jew and Gentile. Nor do we establish social barriers on the basis of </p>
<p>whether or not one is a slave or freeman (Gal 3:28). But it would be a lie to </p>
<p>say we do not live by classiﬁcations. Blue collar vs. white collar. White church </p>
<p>or black church. Too single. Too old. Do you dress the right way? Know the </p>
<p>lingo? Express yourself in worship appropriately? These ﬁltering questions bar </p>
<p>and exclude. So, again I ask, are we a community that is for the people? All </p>
<p>people?</p>
<p>What is needed desperately in our churches, especially in the West, </p>
<p>is a deeper understanding of hospitality. Henri Nouwen says it best when </p>
<p>he writes, “Hospitality means primarily the creation of free space where the </p>
<p>stranger can enter and become a friend instead of an enemy. Hospitality is not </p>
<p>to change people, but to offer them space where change can take place….It </p>
<p>is not a method of making our God and our way into the criteria of happiness, </p>
<p>but the opening of an opportunity to others to ﬁnd their God and their way…</p>
<p>Hospitality is not a subtle invitation to adopt the life style of the host, but the </p>
<p>gift of a chance for the guest to ﬁnd his own.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p>One could take some of Nouwen’s statements in the wrong sense where </p>
<p>“anything goes.” That is not what he meant. He is simply emphatic that, </p>
<p>though all should have the “mind of Christ,” that does not amount to nar-</p>
<p>row uniformity: “There is a great wisdom hidden in the old bell tower calling </p>
<p>people with very different backgrounds away from their homes to form one </p>
body in Jesus Christ. It is precisely by transcending the many individual dif-
<p>ferences that we can become witnesses of God who allow his light to shine </p>
<p>upon poor and rich, healthy and sick alike. But it is also in this encounter on </p>
<p>8. Nouwen 1996: 49.</p>
