<p>anksgiving and Hope (2 ess 1:1–12)124</p>
<p>Clearly there is Jewish conceptual precedent if Paul were to be mak-</p>
<p>ing this kind of point in 2 essalonians. However, there has been strong </p>
<p>pushback against this interpretation. For example, Beverly Gaventa won-</p>
<p>ders whether Paul would endorse such a perspective in view of a suering </p>
<p>community that would lead them to wonder: “Shall I measure my standing </p>
<p>with God by my misfortunes (since God is punishing me now and will </p>
<p>reward me later)?”</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>e other interpretation of 1:5 suggests that the proof of God’s right </p>
<p>judgment is seen, not in the essalonians’ suering per se, but rather in </p>
<p>their response to the aictions—their faithfulness, loyal endurance, and </p>
<p>growth.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>e problem with this view is that it is hard to see their growth as</p>
<p>evidence of God’s judgment.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Perhaps the best solution is to consider the possibility that Paul is </p>
<p>playing with the Greek word “judgment” (krisis). Just as in English, so also </p>
<p>in Greek, this word can have a negative meaning, as in damnation (i.e., </p>
<p>“He cast judgment on me”). However, it can also have a neutral or posi-</p>
<p>tive meaning, as in “I trust the teacher’s judgment.” e second meaning </p>
<p>has to do with someone’s wise decision-making. Here is how this might be </p>
<p>relevant to 2 ess 1:5—perhaps neighbors of the essalonians told them </p>
that their trials served as evidence of divine wrath (i.e., negative judgment).
<p>Paul’s response here is that the trials they face are not unrelated to God, </p>
<p>and involve his judgment, but it is his krisis in the positive sense—he has </p>
<p>deemed it right and appropriate to allow his essalonian people to face </p>
<p>persecution, just as he showed Paul how much Paul must suer for God’s </p>
<p>name (Acts 9:16). is coheres with the narrative of Acts 5:41 where the </p>
<p>apostles le the council celebrating that “they were considered worthy to </p>
<p>suer dishonor for the sake of the name.”</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Here is how I understand what Paul is saying in 1:5: You essalonians </p>
<p>are suering and you wonder, “Who is pulling the strings up there in heaven? </p>
<p>Is God in control? Is he punishing us? Is he trustworthy? I say to you, God is in </p>
<p>control and he is acting according to his good pleasure and looking aer you </p>
<p>at the same time. e aictions you are suering are not a negative reection </p>
<p>of your worth and value to God, but you should consider it a privilege that he </p>
