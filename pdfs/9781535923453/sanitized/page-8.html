<p>Prefaceviii</p>
<p>I presented some of my research ndings to the Biblical Ethics group </p>
<p>of the Society of Biblical Literature, and my appreciation goes to them </p>
<p>for creating an opportunity for helpful feedback. Also, two students at </p>
<p>George Fox Seminary—Evan Simmons and Daniel Bela—journeyed with </p>
<p>me through the Greek text of 1–2 essalonians over the course of the </p>
<p>2014–15 year contributing many insights into these texts and stimulating </p>
<p>my own curiosity. I would also like to thank the George Fox University and </p>
<p>Seminary Faculty Development Committee for awarding me a period of </p>
<p>research leave to complete this book (Grant GFU2015L05). </p>
<p>is commentary is dedicated to my family: my wife, Amy, for her </p>
<p>patience when I was working intensely on this book, and her Christian </p>
<p>model as “loyalty that works . . . love that labors . . . and endurance driven </p>
<p>by hope in our Lord Messiah Jesus” (1 ess 1:3); for my children (Simryn, </p>
<p>Aidan, and Libby) for the play-lled delight they bring to my life. ey are </p>
<p>my “glory and joy” (1 ess 2:20)! </p>
<p>(NB: In the commentary, we have preferred to use “Messiah” instead of “Christ.” Sec-</p>
<p>ondly, all biblical quotations are from the NRSV except for 1-2 essalonians where I </p>
<p>have supplied my own translation. When there are any exceptions, they are marked.)</p>
