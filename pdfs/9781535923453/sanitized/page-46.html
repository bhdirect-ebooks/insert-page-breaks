<p>what this means for the nature of its authenticity. e arguments based on </p>
<p>style fall prey to the same methodological criticism.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>Analysis of the style</p>
<p>of 2 essalonians is simply inconclusive. Andrew Pitts has recently inves-</p>
<p>tigated its style based on insights from linguistics and especially in light of </p>
<p>“register inuences.”</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>e matter of historical implausibility is potentially more signicant, </p>
<p>but the two issues oen raised (appeal to “tradition” and the Lawless One </p>
<p>as Nero) can be otherwise explained within Paul’s ministry to the essalo-</p>
<p>nians. Paul does mention what he previously taught them several times in 1 </p>
<p>essalonians (3:4; 5:1–2), and he uses the specic language of “tradition” </p>
in 1 Cor 11:2 (cf. Rom 6:17; 16:17). On the matter of Nero redivivus, if
<p>a pseudepigrapher were writing aer AD 70, Marshall believes it unlikely </p>
<p>that the author would refer to this Lawless One setting himself up in the </p>
<p>temple (since the Jewish temple was destroyed in 70; see 2 ess 2:4).</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>What about the tone of 2 essalonians (as more cold and authoritar-</p>
<p>ian)? Abraham Malherbe defuses this concern aptly:</p>
<p>[I]t needs to be stated that it is fundamentally wrong to compare </p>
<p>the language of the two letters in this way. e investigation is </p>
<p>shaped by the question of pseudonymity, which means that dif-</p>
<p>ferences are concentrated on and their signicance is exaggerated. </p>
<p>ere is either no, or at the most insucient, attention given to </p>
<p>how the changes in the situation in essalonica may have caused </p>
<p>Paul to consciously adopt a dierent style at points to achieve his </p>
<p>present goal, into the one he had when he wrote 1 essalonians. </p>
<p>All Paul’s letters, aer all, have their peculiarities.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for 2 ess 3:17 as a pseudonymous “tell,” the possible scenarios that </p>
<p>would give rise for a pseudepigrapher to make such a statement are hard to </p>
<p>imagine. e pseudepigrapher would have to be relying on 1 Corinthians </p>
<p>94. See Marshall 1984: 32.</p>
<p>95. Andrew Pitts denes “register” as “contexts for language varieties ranging from </p>
<p>literary genres to social situations” (including, e.g., audience design); see 117. He notes </p>
<p>that using basic statistics (vocabulary, “style”) to settle the matter of authorship is meth-</p>
<p>odological dubious given the range of possible options for how Paul might respond to all </p>
<p>the variables; see Pitts 2013: 151–52.</p>
<p>96. Marshall 1984: 191.</p>
<p>97. Malherbe 2000: 367; see also Witherington 2006: 29. Although Menken agrees </p>
<p>that an author can change tone from one letter to the next, he imagines this less likely if </p>
<p>Paul himself wrote both letters in so short of a timespan (Menken 1994: 30–31). Perhaps, </p>
<p>but this would imply his “tone” is determined by his mood (alone?) rather than his rhe-</p>
<p>torical strategy. </p>
