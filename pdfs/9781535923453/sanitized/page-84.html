<p>Paul’s Love, Pride, and Concern (1 ess 2:17—3:13) 72</p>
<p>ere is a sense in which Paul receives vitality and life through the lives </p>
<p>of his converts. Imagine parents whose college-age daughter goes o to </p>
<p>Europe on spring break and they discover on the news that an airplane </p>
<p>crashed aer take-o from the airport where she departed. Until they know </p>
<p>if it is their child’s plane, their hearts stop and deep panic sets in. When they </p>
<p>get the phone call from their daughter (who was safely on a dierent ight), </p>
<p>what relief and joy! Given how much Paul and his companions invested in </p>
<p>their churches, it is no wonder they became his lifeblood. F. F. Bruce’s para-</p>
<p>phrase of Paul’s sentiment is especially eloquent and appropriate: “the news </p>
<p>of your unwavering faith and love is the very breath of life to us.”</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>So lled</p>
<p>to the brim with joy is Paul at this news that he could not possibly think of </p>
<p>a big enough gi to give back to God for God’s gi of the essalonians to </p>
<p>him (3:9).</p>
<p>Once more we come to know of Paul’s constant attentiveness to them </p>
<p>in prayer (“night and day”) in the hopes that he can be with them and “meet </p>
<p>the needs of your loyalty” (3:10). It is unclear what Paul means by this, </p>
<p>but we may have a clue by looking at similar language in Romans. In the </p>
<p>opening chapter of Paul’s letter to Rome, he communicates his intent to </p>
<p>see the Roman believers in person, and to impart to them a spiritual gi to </p>
<p>strengthen them (Rom 1:11). He claries: “that is, that we may be mutually </p>
<p>comforted by one another’s faith, both yours and mine” (Rom 1:12). Simi-</p>
<p>larly, Paul wanted to be with the essalonians in their time of distress to </p>
<p>give them comfort and encouragement. Perhaps this could happen through </p>
<p>additional teaching, but one also imagines that simply catching up together </p>
<p>as friends could oer a special consolation and refreshment (as we oen </p>
<p>see when friends visit loved ones in the hospital and simply provide good </p>
<p>company). </p>
<p>Paul’s Prayer-Wish (3:11–13)</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Now may God our Father himself and Messiah Jesus our Lord </p>
<p>guide us on a path to you. </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>And may the Lord cause your love to </p>
<p>abound and overow both for each other and for all people in the </p>
<p>way that we love you. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>So may he strengthen your hearts so that </p>
<p>you may be blameless and holy before our God and Father when </p>
<p>our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones. </p>
<p>18. Bruce 1982: 67.</p>
