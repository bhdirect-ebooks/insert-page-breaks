<p>Excursus : Was the Church of the Thessalonians a Male-Only </p>
<p>Guild?</p>
<p>Richard Ascough has made the argument that the church in Thessalonica </p>
<p>may have started as an artisan guild or association that, as a group, embraced </p>
<p>Paul’s good news about Messiah Jesus.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Firstly, he notes that Thessalonica</p>
<p>had many guilds of various kinds. Secondly, Paul himself refers to working </p>
<p>with hands (4:11), which may identify his readers as co-members of an arti-</p>
<p>san association. For Ascough, this would align with what appears to be a sole </p>
<p>focus of the letter on men (see 1 Thess 4:4), thus he proposes that the church </p>
<p>would have been nearly male-only, as some guilds were gender-exclusive in </p>
<p>Antiquity.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>He notes, on this matter, how apt Paul was in this letter to refer</p>
<p>to this church as “brothers.” Ascough also appeals to 1 Thess 1:9, how the </p>
<p>Thessalonians turned (plural) away from idols to serve (plural) the living and </p>
<p>true God, as evidence for the collective nature of their conversion.</p>
<p>This theory has piqued the interest of several scholars.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>However, we</p>
<p>must be careful not to turn possibilities into probabilities. After all, as Lindsey </p>
<p>Trozzo notes in her critique of Ascough’s theory, Paul is not necessarily using </p>
<p>the language of working with hands in 4:11 in a technical sense.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Also, Trozzo</p>
<p>argues that there is insufﬁcient evidence to assume that artisan guilds were </p>
<p>gender exclusive.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Furthermore, what would stop Paul from encouraging them to include </p>
<p>women in their believing community?</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>As M. Johnson-DeBraufre also urges,</p>
<p>even if it were true that this church was guild-like and was male-only, does </p>
<p>that imply the complete absence of women?</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>As early churches often met</p>
<p>in houses, Johnson-DeBraufre wonders where believing women might have </p>
<p>heard Paul’s letter in these spaces, as assistants, slaves, relatives, and other-</p>

<p>22. One commentator of which I am aware, Linda M. Bridges, has taken up Ascough’s </p>
<p>proposal and integrated this theory into her commentary; see Bridges 2008.</p>

<p>24. Trozzo points out that Paul’s associate Priscilla herself was a female tent-maker </p>
<p>(p. 42), perhaps even co-participant in a guild with her husband Aquila; see Keller 2010: </p>
<p>3; see also Johnson 1992: 322.</p>
