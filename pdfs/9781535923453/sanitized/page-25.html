<p>Excursus: Gentile Believers Incorporated into Israel’sStorythrough Jesus 13</p>
<p>urged, “We cannot ensure you will survive the wrath of God if you continue on </p>
<p>following this Jesus.” The fear of wrath may have scared the Thessalonians </p>
<p>enough they lost some security in their identity in Jesus. Paul, then, wrote </p>
<p>1 Thessalonians as a form of subversive rhetoric, trying to undo any of the </p>
<p>damage done by fear-inducing words from opponents. His clear message to </p>
<p>them in 1 Thessalonians is that their hope is found in Jesus alone; through </p>
<p>him they are secure as God’s beloved, his chosen people. Paul would not have </p>
<p>been saying this over and against Jews, but rather in afﬁrmation of Gentiles </p>
<p>incorporated into the people of God through Messiah Jesus. Thus, Paul can </p>
<p>argue that he wants Gentiles saved, while the Jews (particularly those hostile </p>
<p>to believers in Jesus) displease God by preventing this (1 Thess 2:15).</p>
<p>Knowing of the essalonians’ persecution (1 ess 3:1–6), Paul and </p>
<p>his apostolic associates were concerned about the essalonians’ pistis. </p>
<p>Typically this word is translated “faith” (1:3, 8; 3:2, 5–7, 10; 5:8). However, </p>
<p>pistis is a polyvalent Greek noun and can cover a range of meanings from </p>
<p>belief to trust to faithfulness and loyalty. e way that Paul talks about the </p>
<p>strength of the essalonians’ pistis he is almost certainly not referring to </p>
<p>their beliefs as such. Rather, pistis was a term used in the Greco-Roman </p>
<p>world especially in relation to loyalty.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>Also, around the time of Paul, Jews</p>
<p>in particular were using pistis as a way of referring to pledges of loyalty </p>
<p>within a covenantal relationship.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> Particularly in chapter 3 of 1 essalo-</p>
<p>nians, Paul refers to his concern for their pistis in the context of aiction. </p>
<p>Timothy was dispatched to see about their pistis lest the tempter overwhelm </p>
<p>them (3:5). Paul was not worried about their belief per se, but the “whole </p>
<p>package” of their commitment to the Messiah and their complete trust in </p>
<p>him. e best terms to translate pistis, then, are probably “trust,” “loyalty,” </p>
<p>or “faithfulness.”</p>

<p>42. See Malina 2003: 359.</p>
<p>43. See esp LXX Neh 10:1; also Josephus Ant. Passim.</p>
<p>44. I believe the translation “faith” is best justied when Paul clearly appears to be </p>
<p>using pistis in reference to trust that goes against natural senses, “believing the unbeliev-</p>
<p>able,” so to speak; see 2 Cor 5:7. For similar argumentation regarding the best translation </p>
<p>of pistis in 1–2 essalonians, see Andy Johnson 2016, forthcoming on pistis in 1:3.</p>
