<p>Introduction32</p>
<p>this not language that is indicative of a more developed age of Christianity, </p>
<p>rather than something Paul would have appealed to in AD 51–52?</p>
<p>86</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another issue that has raised questions about historical plausibility </p>
<p>is the way that the Lawless One is portrayed in 2 essalonians 2:1–12 as </p>
what appears to be Nero back from the dead (hence, Nero redivivus). Some
<p>scholars argue that if this Lawless One is a return of Nero, then the author </p>
<p>of 2 essalonians must have already thought Nero was dead—and he died </p>
<p>in AD 68, a time too late to t into Paul’s ministry to the essalonians.</p>
<p>Ton e</p>
<p>Several scholars have raised the issue of the dierence in tone between 1 </p>
<p>and 2 essalonians. It appears that the tone of 2 essalonians is imper-</p>
<p>sonal and formal, while that of 1 essalonians is more aectionate and </p>
<p>intimate.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p> e dierence is so stark that it seems to some that this is prob-</p>
<p>ably not the same Paul.</p>
<p>Pseudonymous “Tells” </p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most important arguments made by those who do not </p>
<p>think Paul wrote 2 essalonians is that the text features elements that </p>
<p>seem like a pseudonymous “tells” or giveaways. e best example of this is 2 </p>
<p>ess 3:17 where the author directly states: “I, Paul, write this greeting with </p>
<p>my own hand. is is the mark in every letter of mine; it is the way I write.” </p>
<p>Could this be a pseudonymous writer trying too hard to present himself </p>
<p>as Paul? As Krentz facetiously comments: “e author of 2 essalonians </p>
<p>doth protest too much, methinks.”</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>Theological Differences</p>
A nal matter in this debate specically relates to theological divergences
<p>in 2 essalonians compared to 1 essalonians. As this argument goes, </p>
<p>in 1 essalonians, Paul’s eschatological emphasis is on the soon-coming </p>
<p>86. See Brown 1997: 594.</p>
<p>87. See Furnish 2007: 132; Bridges 2008: 195.</p>
<p>88. Krentz 2009: 469; cf. Collins 1988: 223. Some scholars also think we see an un-</p>
<p>dermining of 1 essalonians itself by the so-called pseudonymous author of 2 es-</p>
<p>salonians when he refers to a false letter “as though from us”—some surmise that in this </p>
<p>case 2 essalonians was possibly written to reject 1 essalonians.</p>
