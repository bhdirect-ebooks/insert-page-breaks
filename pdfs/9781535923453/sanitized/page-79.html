<p>Paul’s Love, Pride, and Concern (1 ess 2:17—3:13) 67</p>
<p>his unscheduled departure as they were.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>But, though he had to leave, they</p>
<p>were always on his mind and he was eager to pay them another visit. </p>
<p>Paul admits that he attempted to see them on several occasions, but </p>
<p>Satan blocked the way (2:18).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>What does Paul mean by this? Did Satan</p>
<p>literally appear and stand in his way? Or is this an interpretive statement, </p>
<p>viewing an obstacle (e.g., the equivalent of a at tire or cancelled ight) as </p>
<p>the work of a hostile power threatening his ministry? Given a text like 2 </p>
<p>Cor 12:7–8 where Paul was given a “thorn in the esh” as a messenger from </p>
<p>Satan, and the thorn was probably either a physical ailment or the problem </p>
<p>of his own persecutors, one could see how the Apostle could interpret vari-</p>
<p>ous hindrances to visiting the essalonians as schemes of Satan (see 2 Cor </p>
<p>2:11; Eph 6:16; cf. 1 Pet 5:8).</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>In any case, the wider point is obvious—if</p>
<p>there is any suspicion or blame for Paul’s distance from the essalonians, it </p>
<p>should fall squarely on the real enemy, Satan, God’s adversary (Rom 16:20; </p>
<p>Cf. 1 Tim 5:15).</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul intends to make his relationship with the essalonians as clear </p>
<p>as possible. He has shown that he cares for them deeply (see 2:1–12). Here </p>
<p>he also acknowledges that they are his “pride and joy,” so to speak.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>He</p>
<p>takes “joy” in them because he recognizes their work, labor, and endurance </p>
<p>(see 1:3) and he especially values their trust in God. </p>
<p>What does it mean that they are his “hope”? Paul mentions the com-</p>
<p>ing of the Lord Jesus here. At that future moment, a great light will shine on </p>
<p>all people and all history, exposing everything that was hidden (1 Cor 4:5). </p>
<p>When it comes to Paul, it seems to be that he will be examined in some way </p>
<p>2. See Burke 2003: 157–62. Burke underscores that this language puts the emphasis, </p>
<p>not on Paul’s power as apostle or father, but as one who is vulnerable, “perhaps in order </p>
<p>to identify with his own converts’ sense of vulnerability, not to mention their social and </p>
<p>familial isolation experienced upon turning ‘from idols to serve the living and true God’” </p>
<p>(1:9; see 2003: 162).</p>
<p>3. Gregory A. Boyd oers a brief, but insightful discussion of Satan according to the </p>
<p>New Testament; see Boyd 2001: 38–39.</p>
<p>4. For a succinct and insightful discussion of 2 Cor 12:7–8, see Guthrie 2015: 590–92.</p>
<p>5. See Malherbe 2000: 184.</p>
<p>6. St. John Chrysostom compares this language of pride to that of a parent: “Ob-</p>
<p>serve then the words, which are those of women, inamed with tenderness, talking to </p>
<p>their little children.” But Chrysostom is quick to add about Paul’s remarks in 2:19, “Of </p>
<p>what ery warmth is this! Never could either mother, or father, yea if they even met </p>
<p>together, and commingled their love, have shown their own aection to be equivalent </p>
<p>to that of Paul” (Homilies on 1 essalonians III.335); see http://www.newadvent.org/</p>
