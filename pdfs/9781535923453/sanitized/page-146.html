<p>Perseverance and Hope (2 ess 2:1–17)134</p>
<p>good sense to see this language as comprehensive—for someone who is </p>
<p>anti-Law and anti-God, destruction follows wherever he goes, and his own </p>
<p>demise is inevitable.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul does not specically identify the Lawless One, but the language </p>
<p>he uses for him is reminiscent of notorious enemies in Israel’s past. In the </p>
<p>second century BC, the tyrant Antiochus Epiphanes persecuted the Jews </p>
<p>and desecrated their temple. In the rst century BC, Roman general Pom-</p>
<p>pey also profaned the Jerusalem temple. According to Psalms of Solomon </p>
<p>17:11–15, Pompey is called “the lawless one,” enemy, and one who cor-</p>
<p>rupted God’s holy house.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Paul’s description of the Lawless One seems</p>
<p>indeed to be based on the archetype of these kinds of anti-God gures. But </p>
<p>for Paul the Lawless One is a person yet to come in the future. Christians </p>
<p>have speculated (sometimes wildly) regarding the identity of this person.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All we can gather from Paul’s brief remarks is that he will be a grandiose </p>
<p>rebel in league with Satan (see 2 ess 2:9). Whether he is superhuman</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p>or mortal</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>is unclear from the little that Paul writes, but it could be that</p>
<p>even Paul did not know the answer to this.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>As far as the Lawless One’s activity in “the temple of God,” did Paul </p>
<p>imagine this as the Jerusalem temple (still standing when he wrote 2 es-</p>
<p>salonians, but destroyed in AD 70) or someplace otherwise (like the “new </p>
<p>11. e New Testament language of “destruction” (apōleia) is sometimes positioned </p>
<p>within binaries; the opposite of destruction is life (Matt 7:13–14) and salvation (Phil </p>
<p>1:28); Paul, in 2 ess 2:3–11, is contrasting the work of the Lawless One (destruction) </p>
<p>with the work of Messiah Jesus (peace and justice).</p>
<p>12. See Menken 1994: 105.</p>
<p>13. Some of the Reformers pointed to the Pope as the “man of sin” and “son of per-</p>
<p>dition” because, as Luther writes, he is the one “who with his doctrines and his laws </p>
<p>increases the sins and perdition of souls in the church, while sitting in the church as if he </p>
<p>were God”; see Whitford 2011: 103. Obviously this interpretation is ridiculous (see dis-</p>
<p>cussions by Morris 220–21; Malherbe 431). ere is also a tradition throughout church </p>
<p>history and Christian scholarship of associating the Lawless One with the emperor Nero, </p>
<p>or at least a kind of “new Nero.” Nero died in AD 68, but many believed he was still alive, </p>
<p>but in hiding. Christians so much had a deep sense that Nero would return in power that, </p>
<p>as Craig Keener notes, “in the Armenian language ‘Nero’ actually became the equivalent </p>
<p>for Antichrist” (see Keener 2009: 338). e challenge with associating Nero with Paul’s </p>
<p>description in 2 essalonians is that Nero did not persecute Christians until aer Paul </p>
wrote this letter; the Nero redivivus theory is only plausible if 2 essalonians was writ-
<p>ten late in the rst century and probably not by Paul; see van Kooten 2005: 177–215.</p>
