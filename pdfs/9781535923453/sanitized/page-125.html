<p>Final Instruction (1 ess 5:12–28) 113</p>
<p>causing trouble.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>One can imagine, in a crisis, troublemakers who complain,</p>
<p>gossip, and stir up problems, rather than bring peace to the community and </p>
<p>help everyone to move forward in hope.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>I would be remiss not to point out Paul’s emphasis on love (agapē), the </p>
<p>driving force that sustains the welfare of the church. Love is the antidote to </p>
<p>a malicious spirit and it is the highest and purest form of goodness.</p>
<p>Attitude, Obedience, and Discernment (5:16–22)</p>
<p>e next section of Paul’s nal instructions appears to stem from the ques-</p>
<p>tion, no doubt “live” in the minds and hearts of the essalonians, what is </p>
<p>God up to? What does he want? What is his will? We, even now, make it a </p>
<p>regular habit of trying to tie events in our life to ways that God might be </p>
<p>leading us. Some of this is good and natural (see John 9:1–3), but there is a </p>
<p>way we can overthink our circumstances and work too hard trying to hear </p>
<p>a message that no one said! Perhaps in view of the recent deaths of multiple </p>
<p>members of the believing community, they wondered how this related to </p>
<p>the will of God (cf. Luke 13:4–5). What if their neighbors told them, “is </p>
<p>all happened because you have turned away from our gods, and now they </p>
<p>are cursing you. Seek their will and appease them!” e essalonian be-</p>
<p>lievers themselves may have wondered whether their own one living and </p>
<p>true God was punishing them for some reason (cf. Jonah 1:6). We must </p>
<p>remember the kind of religious assumptions and sensibilities these Gentiles </p>
<p>would have brought to their new faith. What did you do when you wanted </p>
<p>to know how the world of the gods related to the mortal realm, what their </p>
<p>will was, and how to ensure blessings and avoid curses? You consulted an </p>
<p>oracle or a prophet.</p>
<p>7</p>
An oracle oered divine revelation and wisdom re-
<p>garding matters unknown to mortals, and Greeks and Romans placed a </p>
great deal of trust in divination.
<p>8</p>
<p>us, it would have even been instinctual</p>
<p>for the essalonians to consult oracles about the meaning of recent events, </p>
or the path that lies ahead regarding the divine will.
<p>Notice in 5:16–18 how the focus is on the will of God: “is is God’s </p>
<p>will in Messiah Jesus for you.” (5:18; cf. 4:3). Paul takes what I believe is a </p>
