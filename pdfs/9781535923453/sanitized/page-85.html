<p>Paul’s Love, Pride, and Concern (1 ess 2:17—3:13) 73</p>
<p>So moved is Paul by the hope of seeing the essalonians that he of-</p>
<p>fers a doxological prayer: “Now may God our Father himself and Messiah </p>
<p>Jesus our Lord guide us on a path to you” (3:11). is is the rst of three </p>
<p>prayer-wishes he expresses in 3:11–13. Firstly, he prays that both God and </p>
<p>Jesus open a way to the essalonians. is is a rare, but important, glimpse </p>
<p>into Paul’s Christology in terms of how he views the nature of Jesus himself. </p>
<p>Scholars have long debated whether Paul placed Jesus into the category of </p>
“divine.” is is a complex topic, fraught with historical, theological, and
<p>methodological challenges, but the fact that Paul oers his prayer-wish </p>
<p>both to God the Father and Jesus means that Jesus shares with God the </p>
<p>Father the power to prepare his way and secure his footsteps.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>e second prayer-wish Paul oers (3:12) is focused on a desire for </p>
<p>the Lord “to cause your love to abound and overow both for each other </p>
<p>and for all people in the way that we love you.” If we look ahead to 1 ess </p>
<p>4:10, we see that Paul can arm that there is no serious deciency in their </p>
<p>expression of communal love. He merely prays that they continue to push </p>
<p>forward and not lose steam in this area, a temptation common to those </p>
<p>under pressure and persecution.</p>
<p>In the third prayer-wish, Paul’s focus is on the essalonians’ char-</p>
<p>acter and standing at the return of the Lord Jesus (3:13). In particular, he </p>
<p>prays for their holiness (hagiosynē) and purity (amemptos). is is judg-</p>
ment imagery, where their lives are placed under the divine microscope
<p>and Paul desires that they be able to stand proud and unashamed that they </p>
<p>lived lives pleasing to God (see 4:1–3).</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>e mentioning of the “coming” or “appearance” (parousia) of Jesus is </p>
<p>a special emphasis of 1 essalonians (2:19; 3:13; 4:15; 5:23; cf. 2 ess 2:1, </p>
<p>8). It seems to have been a standard apostolic teaching (James 5:7–8; 2 Pet </p>
<p>1:16; 3:4, 12; 1 John 2:28) and probably reaches back to the Jesus tradition </p>
<p>(e.g., Matt 24:3, 27, 37, 39). e early Christians anticipated the return of </p>
<p>the Lord Jesus with great excitement, but they knew that they too would </p>
<p>face judgment and had to be fully prepared for the careful consideration of </p>
<p>19. See Fee 2007: 53–55.</p>
<p>20. See Matera 2012: 181–83. Morna Hooker notes that, while Paul does frequently </p>
<p>refer to judgment of believers, he maintains condence in the grace and justication of </p>
<p>the Messiah. e references to the examination of the deeds of believers are not about </p>
<p>damnation, but rather accountability; “God’s righteous people must be righteous, urged </p>
<p>Paul, and that meant that they were required to live out the gospel. ey had indeed been </p>
<p>righted by God, but might still fall away. e Christian’s aim must always be to please the </p>
<p>Lord” (Hooker 2008: 161).</p>
