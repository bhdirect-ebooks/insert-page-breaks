<p>appeal to the essalonians needing to continue to live as people of day and </p>
<p>light, not darkness and night. Roman soldiers were known for resoluteness </p>
<p>and bravery, and their unswerving allegiance to the sovereign. So too the </p>
<p>essalonians were called to be intrepid in the face of persecution and to </p>
<p>war against darkness in service of the Lord Jesus. It should be emphasized, </p>
<p>though, that while Paul may have drawn from Greco-Roman language of </p>
<p>warfare,</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>he did not endorse Rome’s way of bringing peace (i.e., through</p>
<p>bloodshed). e “armor” he summons them to don is that of loyalty, love, </p>
<p>and hope (5:8). eir “warfare” should not be characterized by violence, but </p>
<p>nevertheless they should be on the oense in the mission of the gospel, and </p>
<p>not simply on the defense. eir faith should carry the marks of resolute-</p>
<p>ness and fearlessness as God goes before them and empowers them. e </p>
<p>Messiah has called them, no doubt, to a peace-keeping and peace-making </p>
<p>mission, but it ought to be anything but passive.</p>
<p>Perhaps today some balk at the use of warfare language in relation to </p>
<p>Christian theology and life, but Paul was not an especially macho or ag-</p>
<p>gressive person. Rather, he was attuned to the reality of a cosmic war being </p>
<p>waged against the forces of evil. When he writes to the Romans, he warns </p>
<p>them about “what time it is.” It is almost time for the day to dawn, for the </p>
<p>Messiah to return. However, that does not mean that it is time to sit back </p>
<p>and wait for him to descend. Quite the opposite: “Let us then lay aside the </p>
<p>works of darkness and put on the armor of light” (Rom 13:12). Waiting </p>
<p>for the Parousia involves “active waiting,” readiness such that we are found </p>
<p>doing the work of the kingdom when the Lord visits us unexpectedly. If we </p>
<p>really believe we have a battle to win against evil, we will be all-the-more se-</p>
<p>rious about making every moment count. at was a message Paul wanted </p>
<p>the essalonians to learn well.</p>
<p>Along with the above key images in 1 essalonians, we can add a </p>
<p>number of important themes: wrath and salvation, trust and work, hope </p>
<p>and endurance, thanksgiving and joy, and—last but not least—love.</p>
<p>“Wrath” and Salvation</p>
<p>For some reason, the essalonians were particularly concerned with the </p>
<p>end of the world. Certainly Paul taught them about things yet to come, </p>
<p>but he would have wanted neither to instill fear nor paranoia. Still, in his </p>
rst letter he did not shy away from talking about divine wrath. For Paul,
<p>61. See Krentz 2003: 344–83.</p>
