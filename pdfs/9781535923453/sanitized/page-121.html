<p>Fusing the Horizons: War and Peace: e New Covenant Community in Action 109</p>
<p>If we, today, ignore or shun the violent imagery of warfare and soldier-</p>
<p>ing used in Scripture, we will miss the wider point. Model soldiers know the </p>
<p>enemy, trust their training, cooperate with their regiment, obey the army com-</p>
<p>mander, serve the king loyally, and live in a state of readiness-for-action. For </p>
<p>Paul, these are relevant to believers who live in a world hostile to the living </p>
<p>God and his kingdom. Until the new heavens and new earth, the kingdom will </p>
<p>still need soldiers committed to King Jesus and his reign. We would do well, </p>
<p>then, to ask, are we, as the New Covenant Community, ready for battle? Do </p>
<p>we know our enemies (sin, injustice, evil)? Do we recognize that it is the will </p>
<p>of the emperor, the Lord Jesus, that we ﬁght against the injustice around us? </p>
<p>Is “peace” the Christian watchword? Absolutely, but to that we must add </p>
<p>bravery and vigilance, because the days are evil, the enemy is cunning, and </p>
<p>the war is not yet over.</p>
