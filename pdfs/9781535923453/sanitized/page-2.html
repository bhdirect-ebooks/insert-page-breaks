<p>NCCS | New Covenant Commentary Series</p>
<p>e New Covenant Commentary Series (NCCS) is designed for ministers and students </p>
<p>who require a commentary that interacts with the text and context of each New Testa-</p>
<p>ment book and pays specic attention to the impact of the text upon the faith and praxis </p>
<p>of contemporary faith communities.</p>
<p>e NCCS has a number of distinguishing features. First, the contributors come </p>
from a diverse array of backgrounds in regards to their Christian denominations and
<p>countries of origin. Unlike many commentary series that tout themselves as interna-</p>
<p>tional the NCCS can truly boast of a genuinely international cast of contributors with </p>
<p>authors drawn from every continent of the world (except Antarctica) including coun-</p>
<p>tries such as the United States, Puerto Rico, Australia, the United Kingdom, Kenya, </p>
<p>India, Singapore, and Korea. We intend the NCCS to engage in the task of biblical inter-</p>
<p>pretation and theological reection from the perspective of the global church. Second, </p>
<p>the volumes in this series are not verse-by-verse commentaries, but they focus on larger </p>
<p>units of text in order to explicate and interpret the story in the text as opposed to some </p>
<p>oen atomistic approaches. ird, a further aim of these volumes is to provide an oc-</p>
<p>casion for authors to reect on how the New Testament impacts the life, faith, ministry, </p>
<p>and witness of the New Covenant Community today. is occurs periodically under the </p>
<p>heading of “Fusing the Horizons and Forming the Community.” Here authors provide </p>
<p>windows into community formation (how the text shapes the mission and character of </p>
<p>the believing community) and ministerial formation (how the text shapes the ministry </p>
<p>of Christian leaders).</p>
<p>It is our hope that these volumes will represent serious engagements with the New </p>
<p>Testament writings, done in the context of faith, in service of the church, and for the </p>
<p>glorication of God.</p>
