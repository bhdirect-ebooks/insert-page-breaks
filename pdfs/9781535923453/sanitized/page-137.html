<p>anksgiving and Hope (2 ess 1:1–12) 125</p>
<p>would let you represent his kingdom and that he trusts you to rise above the </p>
<p>persecution in faithfulness and hope.</p>
<p>Paul goes on to explain that God is in fact just (dikaios), and it may be </p>
<p>dicult to recognize this in the midst of suering, but believers also expect </p>
<p>that God’s justice will be even clearer when he shines the light of his judg-</p>
<p>ment on all works and people in the end. ose who have taken up the role </p>
<p>of aicter will be “repaid” (1:6). To the unfairly troubled and harassed, God </p>
<p>will nally give rest and relief as well. It is critical to note, even if subtly, </p>
<p>that Paul includes himself (and his fellow apostles) as those who endure </p>
<p>persecution (1:7). e future, nal appearance of the Lord will publicly </p>
<p>declare what can only be known by faith in the present—only those who </p>
<p>know, love, and obey the Lord Messiah Jesus as the unique embodiment </p>
<p>and image of the one eternal God are the true servants of the kingdom of </p>
<p>God (1:8). </p>
<p>ose who persecute the essalonian believers will not “get away </p>
<p>with” their harassment, but will face the punishment of eternal destruction </p>
<p>and will be withheld from the presence of the Lord (1:9).</p>
<p>Excursus: Eternal Destruction (2 Thess 1:9)?</p>
<p>The language of damnation that Paul uses here has been of interest to theo-</p>
<p>logians with a view towards the Apostle’s understanding of “hell.” Did Paul </p>
<p>believe in a hell of unending torment, or did he believe that the damned would </p>
<p>be annihilated?</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>The language of “eternal destruction” is not a clear indicator</p>
<p>either way—how can something be destroyed eternally? The better approach </p>
<p>in this passage is to try and make sense of why Paul raises this matter at </p>
<p>all. His focus is on the punishment of the oppressors; hence “destruction” </p>
<p>represents damnation, God plunging them into ruin. What about “eternal”? I </p>
<p>am persuaded by the direction that C. S. Lewis goes, where the language of </p>
<p>eternality is less about duration than it is about ﬁnality - their verdict is com-</p>
<p>plete, it cannot be undone or overturned. So, Lewis writes, “That the lost soul </p>
<p>is eternally ﬁxed in its diabolical attitude we cannot doubt: but whether this </p>
<p>eternal ﬁxity implies endless duration—or duration at all—we cannot say.”</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I believe Lewis’ eschatological agnosticism is wise. The little bits and pieces </p>
