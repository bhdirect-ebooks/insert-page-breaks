<p>Fusing the Horizons: Can Suering for the Kingdom be a Blessing? 129</p>
<p>theirs as well if they are to know the full measure of the reign of God in their </p>
<p>lives.”</p>

<p> F. F. Bruce sums this up aptly: no cross, no crown.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Persecution, resistance, afﬂictions—the earliest disciples could ﬁnd joy </p>
<p>in this because they felt they had been considered worthy of re-tracing the </p>
<p>steps of Jesus, ﬁghting for hope and justice in a way that threatened the world </p>
<p>order. </p>
<p>The rationale with which Paul and the other NT writers operate is that </p>
<p>everyone will face suffering. Either one experiences worldly fame, luxury, and </p>
<p>glory now—and will suffer judgment later. Or one chooses to follow Jesus, and </p>
<p>with him to suffer as a believer, but with the hope of being gloriﬁed at his </p>
<p>return. In 1 Peter, the choice is made clear: stand ﬁrm with Jesus now and </p>
<p>suffer for (in eternity’s perspective what will be) “a little while,” and after-</p>
<p>wards “the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, </p>
<p>will himself restore, support, strengthen, and establish you” (1 Peter 5:10). </p>
<p>When this is put into perspective, Paul’s words in Philippians make more </p>
<p>sense: God “has graciously granted you the privilege not only of believing in </p>
<p>Christ, but of suffering for him as well” (1:29). How can suffering be a form </p>
<p>of grace, a blessing? The early Christians believed and taught that joining the </p>
<p>kingdom of Messiah Jesus meant signing on to live with him and become like </p>
<p>him. To defy the world in the way Jesus deﬁed the world leads to afﬂictions. It </p>
<p>is an honor and privilege to suffer for his Name.</p>
