<p>e Hopeful Fate of the Christian Dead (1 ess 4:13–18) 92</p>
<p>these death-sleep associations “in the air,” as it were, there seems to be a </p>
<p>more theological purpose behind Paul’s word-choice. </p>
<p>It is almost certain that Paul’s depiction of death as sleep is inuenced </p>
<p>by teachings from the Jesus tradition.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>ere is the well-known story in</p>
<p>the Synoptics where Jesus visits the house of a synagogue leader and heals </p>
<p>his daughter. According to Matthew, he proclaims, “the girl is not dead </p>
<p>but sleeping” (Matt 9:24; cf. Mark 5:39; Luke 8:52). e point is not that </p>
<p>the mourners were wrong to think the young girl dead (for she was dead). </p>
<p>Rather, the point of this saying is that death is such an unequal match for </p>
<p>the life-giving power of Jesus that it does not even deserve to be called </p>
<p>“death.” Jesus is so bursting with vitality that restoring her from the dead, </p>
<p>something no human could do with this kind of authority and ease, is as </p>
<p>simple for Jesus as rousing a sleeping child. No doubt Paul’s point in refer-</p>
<p>ring to death as merely “sleep” is to remind the essalonians that death </p>
<p>is not the end. ere is something more—resurrection life/wakefulness is </p>
<p>waiting just as morning waits for the sleepers until they meet sunrise.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Cyril</p>
<p>of Alexandria once wrote, “To him, as being life by nature, there is nothing </p>
<p>dead. Having a rm hope of the resurrection of the dead, we call the dead </p>
<p>‘those that sleep’ for this reason. ey will arise in Christ, and as the blessed </p>
<p>Paul says, ‘ey live to him,’ because they are about to live.”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>is is what it means to grieve with hope. Paul here implies that most </p>
<p>pagans grieve without hope. While there is evidence that some Greeks and </p>
<p>Romans did believe in a kind of aerlife (see Plato, Georgias 52D),</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>there is</p>
<p>the impression that many expected little beyond the grave.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>So, Greek poet</p>
<p>eocritus famously wrote “hopes are for the living; the dead are without </p>
<p>hope” (Idyll 4.42) and some ancient grave markers have been discovered </p>
<p>that bear the abbreviation NFFNSNC (non fui, fui, non sum, non curo): </p>
<p>“I was not, I was, I am not, I care not.” One Roman tombstone bore this </p>
<p>inscription, “Into nothing from nothing how quickly we go.”</p>

<p>4. Consequently, I think it is unfortunate that several translations render the verb </p>
<p>koimaomai as a form of “died” instead of “asleep” (see NRSV, NLT, CEB).</p>

<p>7. As Martin Goodman writes, “It would be quite wrong to imagine many people in </p>
<p>the Roman world preoccupied with the world to come or weighed down by guilt for sin”; </p>
<p>see 2013: 313.</p>
