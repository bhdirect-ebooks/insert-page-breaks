<p>nor a eeting or occasional emotion. He basically commences the letter by </p>
<p>reference to how love can inspire labor—we are most motivated to work </p>
<p>hard on behalf of what we love (1:3). Reference to their steadfast love ap-</p>
<p>pears in 3:12. But I wish to focus on 4:9–10. Here Paul reminds them of </p>
<p>how they should love one another like family (philadelphia—“sibling love”). </p>
<p>David deSilva oers a nice, succinct illustration of what this kind of sibling </p>
<p>love looks like: “Rather than insisting on having one’s own way at the cost of </p>
<p>a brother or sister’s well-being, the loving sibling will forgo his or her rights </p>
<p>in order to safeguard the well-being of the other.”</p>

<p>At the end of 1 essalonians, Paul oers a few instructions to the </p>
<p>essalonians, one of which especially captures his understanding of </p>
<p>love—dedicate yourself to caring for the weak (5:14). In the competitive </p>
<p>Greco-Roman world it only paid o to help those who can help you. Paul </p>
<p>radically cuts through this quid pro quo mentality to focus on cruciform </p>
<p>love, a kind of pure generosity that places an interest and care on the other. </p>
<p>e Messiah would, of course, have served for Paul as the prime model (see </p>
<p>Rom 15:3)—just as Matthew points to the fulllment of Isa 53:4, “He took </p>
<p>our weaknesses and carried our diseases” (Matt 8:17 NET). To care for the </p>
<p>weak (1 ess 5:14) is to live out the ministry of love demonstrated by Jesus.</p>
<p>2 essalonians: e Story Continues</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>First and Second essalonians is not the only example of a set of texts </p>
<p>written to the same church. We have two letters that Paul wrote to the </p>
<p>Corinthians, for example. However, those Corinthian letters are quite dif-</p>
<p>ferent, dealing with a separate (though not unrelated) set of problems. e </p>
<p>challenge we face with 2 essalonians, in relationship to 1 essalonians, </p>
<p>is that these two letters are very similar. Also, we do not have further in-</p>
<p>formation (e.g., from Acts) to ll the modern reader in on what happened </p>
<p>aer 1 essalonians. Again, we are le to read 2 essalonians and try to </p>
<p>guess how the story continued aer the rst letter. At the very least we can </p>
<p>say condently that things did not get better for the essalonians aer </p>
<p>Paul’s rst letter; rather, they worsened.</p>

<p>65. Some scholars doubt that Paul wrote 2 essalonians. Here we operate under the </p>
<p>assumption that Paul did write 2 essalonians, and a discussion of authorship issues </p>
<p>appears at the end of the introduction under the title: “Who Wrote 2 essalonians?” </p>
<p>(pp. 30–37).</p>
