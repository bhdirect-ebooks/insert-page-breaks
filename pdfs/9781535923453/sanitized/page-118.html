<p>e Day of the Lord: Preparedness and Perseverance, not Prediction106</p>
<p>categorized as either on the side of “light” or the side of “darkness.”</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Paul</p>
himself establishes a clear line dividing day-people from night-people. is
<p>is similar to his portrayal in 2 Cor 6:14–16 (“what fellowship is there be-</p>
<p>tween light and darkness?”). Paul also underscores that, at the Parousia, the </p>
<p>Lord himself will “bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will </p>
<p>disclose the purposes of the heart” (1 Cor 4:5). Perhaps the one passage that </p>
<p>parallels most closely 1 ess 5:4–11 with its night/darkness/sleep language </p>
<p>is Rom 13:11–14:</p>
<p>Besides this, you know what time it is, how it is now the moment </p>
<p>for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than </p>
<p>when we became believers; the night is far gone, the day is near. </p>
<p>Let us then lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of </p>
<p>light; let us live honorably as in the day, not in reveling and drunk-</p>
<p>enness, not in debauchery and licentiousness, not in quarreling </p>
<p>and jealousy. Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no </p>
<p>provision for the esh, to gratify its desires. </p>
<p>Again, it should be obvious that in these kinds of hortatory passages, </p>
<p>Paul’s concern is with godly behavior. For the essalonians, Paul desires </p>
<p>for them to be prepared, to know what really matters, and to focus less on </p>
<p>being “in the know” and more on being “in the right” in their behavior.</p>
<p>Battle as Day-People (5:8–11)</p>
<p>In keeping with the dualistic language introduced earlier, Paul encour-</p>
<p>ages the essalonians to take up the spiritual armor necessary to chal-</p>
<p>lenge their enemies. It is probably not necessary or useful to try to read too </p>
<p>much into each component; the total picture portrays the kind of people </p>
<p>(soldiers) who were recognized in society to be disciplined and prepared. </p>
<p>Perhaps, due to bickering about “times and seasons” and questions about </p>
<p>recent events, there was in-ghting in the church at essalonica. is may </p>
<p>have created a kind of spiritual and moral fog that made it dicult for them </p>
<p>to fully have their wits about them. With their guard down, it would be easy </p>
<p>for members of their community to slip into sinful habits that prevailed in </p>
<p>their former lives before they turned to the living and true God.</p>

<p>15. See, for example, the language of “sons of light” and “sons of darkness” in the </p>
<p>Dead Sea scrolls texts 1QS and 1QM.</p>
<p>16. Best points to the important study by Lovestam (1963) where it is argued that </p>
<p>here sleep and drunkenness are “metaphors for absorption in the aairs of the world” (in </p>
<p>the words of Best 1986: 212; see Lovestam 1963: 34–56). See also Beale 2003: 147: “To be </p>
