<p>acting contrary to the decrees of the emperor, saying that there is another </p>
<p>king named Jesus” (Acts 17:6–7). </p>
<p>While Jason and the others were released when they posted bail, still </p>
<p>the city was perturbed by this matter. Paul and Silas took their leave under </p>
<p>the cover of darkness, making their way to Beroea (17:10). Luke makes it </p>
<p>a point to say that the Jews there were more receptive to the gospel than in </p>
<p>essalonica (17:11). Still, Paul’s essalonian troubles were far from over. </p>
<p>Some Jews from essalonica heard about Paul’s successful ministry in </p>
<p>Beroea and travelled there to turn those people against him as well (17:13). </p>
<p>us, Paul was forced on to Athens. Aer Acts 17, Luke oers no more </p>
<p>clues regarding the situation in essalonica.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>What we surmise about the</p>
<p>situation that led to Paul’s writing of the essalonian letters must come </p>
<p>primarily from historical reconstruction and guesswork based on informa-</p>
<p>tion from the letters themselves.</p>
<p>e Church of the essalonians</p>
<p>Before considering the exigencies that gave rise to 1–2 essalonians, it </p>
<p>behooves us to consider the nature of the church of the essalonians. Ac-</p>
<p>cording to Luke, some Jews responded positively to his preaching, a great </p>
<p>number of “devout Greeks” and “not a few leading women” (Acts 17:4). As </p>
<p>for the rst group, Luke’s some is probably a small number, given how he </p>
<p>represents the overall oense of Paul’s gospel to the Jews in essalonica </p>
<p>(e.g., versus Beroea). Who are these “devout Greeks”? ey are Gentile </p>
<p>“god-fearers,” non-Jews who attached themselves in some way to the Jewish </p>
<p>synagogue. Perhaps they were attracted to Jewish morality, worship of this </p>
<p>one particular god, or the Jewish festivals.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Some scholars have expressed</p>
<p>doubts about the historical reliability of Luke’s account, especially because </p>
<p>Paul characterizes the essalonian believers as those who turned away </p>
<p>from idols to the one God and to Jesus (1 ess 1:9–10).</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>is appears to</p>
<p>some to mean that the church was comprised almost exclusively of Gentile </p>
<p>idol-worshippers who would have had no association with Judaism.</p>

<p> How-</p>
<p>12. Luke does mention certain essalonian believers who cross paths with Paul, </p>
<p>namely, Aristarchus and Secundus (20:4; cf. 27:2).</p>

<p>15. See Gaventa 1998: 20; Ascough 2015: 9. Richard Ascough argues that Luke’s </p>
<p>account in Acts 17 about the rst converts to Christianity in essalonica being Jews </p>
<p>and god-fearers cannot be harmonized with the impression from 1 essalonians. He </p>
