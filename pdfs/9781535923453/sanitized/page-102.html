<p>Fusing the Horizons: Living Quiet Lives in a Noisy World</p>
<p>There is an ironic twinge in Paul’s phrasing in 4:11 that is not readily apparent </p>
<p>in English. When Paul tells the Thessalonians to aspire to live quiet lives, “as-</p>
<p>pire” and “quiet” are not usually put together in a Greek sentence. Aspiration, </p>
<p>in the way it was commonly used in the Greco-Roman world of Paul’s time, </p>
<p>was about struggling, persevering, and, most importantly, competing—essen-</p>
<p>tially, trying to get ahead in a dog-eat-dog world. Given that the Greco-Roman </p>
<p>world was ﬁercely competitive, “to aspire” was to ﬁght and claw your way to </p>
<p>be king of the hill. </p>
<p>Paul cleverly turns this somewhat natural inclination on its head—aspire </p>
<p>to . . . live quietly. What he is saying here is that believers do things differ-</p>
<p>ently, they march to the beat of a different drummer. When they struggle and </p>
<p>persevere, the goal is not to conquer the world by trampling over others. Paul </p>
<p>is basically saying don’t copycat the way of the world, the world’s values and </p>
<p>models for success. </p>
<p>The redeemed, grace-rich people of God do not need to add extra noise </p>
<p>to a noisy world. To live “quietly” does not mean to sequester yourself, to step </p>
<p>out of the world (see 1 Cor 5:9–10). Rather, it is to respond to your God-given </p>
<p>vocation and feel comfortable in your own skin and place in the world, such </p>
<p>that your focus is not on being so loud about yourself that you get the right </p>
<p>attention and boost your reputation up in the right ways in public. Heart-</p>
<p>quietness, life-quietness, is the by-product of contentment. Contentment can </p>
<p>only come from peace with God.</p>
