<p>Introduction 23</p>
<p>Come, let us return to the Lord; for it is he who has torn, and he </p>
<p>will heal us; he has struck down, and he will bind us up. Aer two </p>
<p>days he will revive us, on the third day he will raise us up, that we </p>
<p>may live before him. Let us know, let us press on to know the Lord, </p>
<p>his appealing is as sure as the dawn; he will come to us like the </p>
<p>showers, like the spring rains that water the earth. </p>
<p>His appearing is a sure as the dawn. He will heal us. He will raise us up. </p>
<p>Paul may have even been thinking about such verses when it came to the </p>
<p>death of some beloved essalonians. Hope is walking in the light of the </p>
<p>future dawn. Christian hope is anticipatory imagination. Christian hope is </p>
<p>the capacity to actualize and embrace the power of God’s promised (and, </p>
<p>thus, certain) future in the present through Jesus. Hope is less a wish and </p>
<p>more a muscle that must be exercised (see Rom 5:3–5). And we exercise </p>
<p>hope by enduring trust and hard work. </p>
<p>anksgiving and Joy</p>
<p>In light of the perilous ministry life that Paul endured, it is striking that his </p>
<p>letters, not least 1 essalonians, are characterized by thanksgiving: he is </p>
<p>thankful for his essalonians brothers and sisters who accepted the gospel </p>
<p>with joy and faith (1:6; 2:13) and who show great resilience in aiction </p>
<p>(1:2–3). Paul himself rejoiced in their life (2:19–20). ey became a source </p>
<p>of deep happiness for him (3:9). He passed on a ministry of thanksgiving </p>
<p>to them as well (5:18). </p>
<p>anksgiving and joy require faith and hope. It is easy to wallow. It </p>
<p>is convenient to complain. It is a discipline to release oneself from worldly </p>
<p>comparison, from “keeping up with the Joneses,” and to learn to live a quiet </p>
<p>life (4:11). Paul tells the Philippians, writing to them from prison, that he </p>
<p>has learned how to be content; sometimes you have a little and sometimes </p>
<p>you have more (Phil 4:11–12). He trained himself not to wager his joy on </p>
<p>stu so that he could always be thankful. </p>
<p>Love</p>
<p>I would be remiss not to include love (agapē) in the list of themes for 1 </p>
<p>essalonians. is completes our discussion of the faith-hope-love triad, </p>
<p>and it also represents well the emphasis Paul places on love as the deepest </p>
<p>expression of true discipleship. Love, for Paul, is not mere sentimentality, </p>
