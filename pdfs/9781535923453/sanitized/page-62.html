<p>Paul’s Blameless Ministry (1 Thess 2:1–12)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>For you know for yourselves, my dear brothers and sisters, that </p>
<p>our coming to you was not useless. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>On the contrary, even though </p>
<p>we had suered before and were mistreated in Philippi, as you </p>
<p>know, yet we were given courage by our God to speak God’s good </p>
<p>news to you despite erce opposition. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>For our appeal did not </p>
<p>come from an error, or impure motives, or trickery. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Rather, as we </p>
<p>have been approved by God to be entrusted with the good news, </p>
<p>so we speak, not to please mortals, but to please the God who tests </p>
<p>our hearts. </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>For we never appeared with attering words, as you </p>
<p>know, nor by trying to be fake to hide greed—God serves as our </p>
<p>witness!—</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>nor chasing aer glory from mortals—not from you, </p>
<p>nor anyone else. </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>We could have done this, imposing our weight as </p>
<p>“apostles of the Messiah.” But, instead, we became infants among </p>
<p>you. Like a nursing mother tenderly caring for her children, </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>so </p>
<p>we felt about you. It pleased us to share with you, not only the </p>
<p>good news of God, but also the depths of our souls, because you </p>
<p>became beloved to us. </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>For you remember, my dear brothers and sisters, our labor </p>
<p>and toil; night and day we were working to prevent burdening any </p>
<p>of you when we preached the good news of God to you. </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>You </p>
<p>yourselves stand witness, along with God, how holy and just </p>
<p>and blameless we were before you who believe.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>As you know, </p>
<p>towards each one of you as a father to his children, </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>we were </p>
<p>encouraging you, comforting you, and insisting that you live your </p>
<p>lives in a manner worthy of the God who is calling you into his </p>
<p>own glorious kingdom. </p>
<p>While Paul focuses in the rst chapter on the essalonians’ own </p>
<p>faithful reception of the good news and their trust in God through Messiah </p>
<p>Jesus, he then turns to his own ministry (2:1–12) with special concern to </p>
<p>demonstrate his blameless and exemplary apostolic behavior.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Scholars</p>
<p>have wondered whether Paul is being defensive (as if his own behavior and </p>
<p>1. ough I refer in this section to “Paul,” this is simply a shorthand way of referring </p>
<p>to the Pauline apostolic team, as he repeatedly refers to “we” and “our” implying inclu-</p>
<p>sion of others in his leadership cohort.</p>
