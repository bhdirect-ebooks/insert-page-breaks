<p>Introduction2</p>
<p>Hope, in the Christian vocabulary, is a worldview word. If “faith” </p>
<p>represents the reliance on an alternative reality based on the revelation of </p>
<p>God according to his work and words vis-à-vis the past and present, then </p>
<p>“hope” involves the sustaining of a present alternative view of reality based </p>
<p>on what God has promised to do in the future. Christians do not look ahead </p>
<p>simply in order to be done with life and oat away to eternal bliss in heaven. </p>
<p>ey lean on hope to survive, live, and even thrive in the present by seeing </p>
<p>through God’s eyes, and particularly God’s promises about what he is going </p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>We might better understand what Paul says in 1 essalonians, and </p>
<p>why he says it the way he does, by thinking through the social nature of </p>
<p>how we understand reality. Social anthropologist Cliord Geertz explains </p>
<p>that all humans develop “webs of signicance” that sustain a larger world </p>
<p>around us. It is that intertexture of symbols, relationships, and frameworks </p>
<p>that give us stability and comfort in life.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>However, there are always threats</p>
<p>and challenges to our world-structure. e question that remains is wheth-</p>
<p>er or not one’s symbolic world-system can accommodate and maintain </p>
<p>its integrity in light of perplexities. Geertz goes on to argue that religious </p>
<p>systems are particularly designed to secure and stabilize the human and </p>
<p>community under just such circumstances if they are t for the task. </p>
<p>What does this have to do with Paul? It is easily recognized that Paul </p>
<p>writes 1 essalonians to a community that is beginning to lose its con-</p>
<p>dence and foundation of its faith. ere are problems, questions, and </p>
<p>perplexities on many levels and in a variety of areas. is triggers a kind </p>
<p>of “ght or ight” reaction that could cause serious problems in the fu-</p>
<p>ture. Paul, though he was not a modern social anthropologist, knew that he </p>
<p>had to help them re-establish terra rma beneath their feet and their weak </p>
<p>knees. He did so by anchoring their faith to the past (and their exemplary </p>
<p>reception of the gospel), to the present (as they have shown ongoing resil-</p>
<p>ience and love in recent times), and especially their future (as their hope is </p>
<p>in a coming Lord Jesus). </p>
<p>is letter, 1 essalonians, is Paul’s work as a master-builder who </p>
<p>shapes a distinctly Christian worldview that profoundly brings together </p>
<p>heaven and earth. Christians live in “waiting” (1:10), as they have one eye </p>
<p>on the sky and anticipate the descending rider-of-the-clouds (4:17). ey </p>
<p>do this, not to abandon the physical earth, but to await the Sovereign and </p>
<p>Judge who will nally bring justice to an unjust and cruel world. However, </p>
