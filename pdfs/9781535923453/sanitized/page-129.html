<p>as a strange practice, uncomfortably intimate, even erotic. However, Er-</p>
<p>nest Best does well to explain the socio-cultural dimensions of kissing in </p>
<p>Paul’s world: “e kiss was given on the lips (normally only in sex), on the </p>
<p>cheeks, brow and shoulders (among kinsfolk), on the hands and feet (in </p>
<p>honouring a superior).”</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Two things are safe assumptions based on what</p>
<p>we know from the New Testament about this practice in the early churches. </p>
<p>First, it was not a kiss on the lips. And, secondly, the pervasiveness of this </p>
<p>tradition and the fact that Paul mentions it to the essalonians without </p>
<p>further explanation means that it became a common church practice very </p>
<p>early on. Ben Witherington is wise to suggest that this tradition “caught </p>
<p>on” because it was a very clear symbol and gesture of the unique bond and </p>
<p>relationship between “brothers and sisters” in the Messiah—they were part </p>
<p>of a special family through Messiah Jesus under God the Father.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Again, it</p>
<p>was common for family members to kiss one another and a perfect example </p>
<p>is found in Jesus’ Parable of the Prodigal Son: “But while he was still far o, </p>
<p>his father saw him and was lled with compassion; he ran and put his arms </p>
<p>around him and kissed him” (Luke 15:20). With this example in mind, it </p>
<p>is no wonder 1 Peter 5:14 refers to the ecclesial holy kiss as a “kiss of love!”</p>
<p>ose who become part of the people of God in Messiah Jesus are </p>
<p>now family. How radically counter-cultural it was for these early Christians </p>
<p>to embrace and kiss one another as family members do even though some </p>
<p>were Jews and others Gentiles! It makes sense in my modern Western cul-</p>
<p>ture not to practice the holy kiss tradition, but do we have ways in which we </p>
<p>share love, fellowship, and friendship with one another on a regular basis </p>
<p>as brothers and sisters in Messiah Jesus? If Paul made it a point to give this </p>
<p>command on so many occasions, how can we honor the spirit of what he </p>
<p>asks, even if we cannot fulll the specic request?</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Next, Paul requests, in no uncertain terms, that his letter should be </p>
<p>read publicly in the church (5:27). It could be that he wanted to ensure that </p>
<p>the exhortations were heard by any who have caused problems (such as </p>
<p>the ataktoi). However, a plainer assumption would simply be that Paul did </p>
<p>not want the “leadership” of the church to be the sole parties responsible </p>
<p>for the health and growth of the church. ere is something refreshingly </p>
<p>transparent and egalitarian about his solemn request. Each one, whatever </p>
<p>status or role, is responsible for the health of the body. Each one is called to </p>
