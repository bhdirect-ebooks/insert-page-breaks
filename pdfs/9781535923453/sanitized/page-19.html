<p>Introduction 7</p>
<p>ever, as Todd Still notes, if Paul had attracted Jews and god-fearing Gentiles </p>
<p>away from the synagogue towards faith in Jesus, this would explain Jewish </p>
<p>hostility against Paul that is attested in both Acts and 1 essalonians (see </p>
<p>1 ess 2:15).</p>
<p>If Paul did have some success in luring God-fearing and well-o </p>
<p>Gentiles away from the synagogue by his preaching and continued </p>
<p>to poach on Jewish preserves even aer he had been cut o from </p>
<p>the synagogue, then it is reasonable to think that he would have </p>
<p>provoked a negative Jewish response. Not only would the Jewish </p>
<p>community have viewed Gentile adherents as potential proselytes, </p>
<p>but they would also have valued their nancial and social support. </p>
<p>While Jewish jealousy or zeal incited by Paul’s missionary activity </p>
<p>among synagogue adherents only partially explains Paul’s conict </p>
<p>with essalonian Jews, it may well have been a primary reason </p>
<p>that Paul encountered Jewish opposition in essalonica (and </p>
<p>elsewhere).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e third category of people Luke mentions in Acts 17:4 is “leading </p>
<p>women,” women of wealth and inuence (i.e., elite). It is possible that these </p>
<p>women were benefactors to the Jewish community in essalonica. Lynn </p>
<p>Cohick oers the example of Capitolina, a Gentile woman who gave money </p>
<p>to the synagogue at Tralles (Asia Minor).</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>is aligns with other examples</p>
<p>in the New Testament of women of means attracted to the gospel of Mes-</p>
<p>siah Jesus (such as Phoebe, Romans 16). Although the church must have </p>
<p>had a few wealthy believers, the majority of the church would have been </p>
<p>relatively poor, the kind of people who work with their hands (1 ess 2:9; </p>
<p>4:11; 5:14).</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>How large was the church in essalonica? Narrowing this</p>
<p>number down is impossible, but Eugene Boring is probably correct that we </p>
<p>are talking about dozens, not hundreds.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> </p>
<p>explains: “e natural understanding of this text is that these initial adherents in es-</p>
<p>salonike were not Jewish or even Jewish sympathizers. ey were, in fact, non-Jews who </p>
<p>worshipped one or more of the many deities in the Greek and Roman pantheon, if not </p>
<p>also a few local gods alongside them. e essalonian Christ group is thus a Gentile </p>
<p>group at its core” (9).</p>
