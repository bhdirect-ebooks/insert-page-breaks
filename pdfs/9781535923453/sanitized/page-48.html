<p>Conclusion on Authorship</p>
<p>Despite the surge of popularity in favor of the vote for pseudonymity in the </p>
<p>early and middle twentieth century, condence in this decision has largely </p>
<p>waned in the UK and North America.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> Probably many are like me: agnos-</p>
<p>tic.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>I have lost condence that we have the tools and the samples sucient</p>
<p>to render a judgment of “not written by Paul” on texts like 2 essalonians </p>
<p>and Colossians. My assumption of authenticity is not borne out of 100 per-</p>
<p>cent condence, but rather in a lack of persuasive evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>I follow the guidance of Markus Barth in his evaluation of the authenticity </p>
<p>of Colossians: in dubio pro reo—“when in doubt, side with the accused” </p>
<p>(or as we sometimes say, “innocent until proven guilty”). ose who argue </p>
<p>from pseudonymity may have “rescued” Paul from inconsistencies, but </p>
<p>they insuciently explain why someone would write such a letter, in Paul’s </p>
<p>name, to one specic church, about issues that relate to 1 essalonians </p>
<p>101. See Foster 2012: 154; thus this proclamation by Eugene Boring is probably un-</p>
<p>true: “is [pseudonymous conclusion] is now probably the majority view among criti-</p>
<p>cal scholars” (Boring Intro 362). However, Fee’s statement towards the opposite is also </p>
<p>exaggerated: “the writing of a commentary on this letter in and of itself tends to push one </p>
<p>towards authenticity regarding authorship, so that there has been only one signicant </p>
<p>commentary in English [Earl Richard] over the past century and a half that has tried to </p>
<p>make sense of this letter as a forger” (Fee 2009: 237). Fee may be right if we only include </p>
<p>technical (advanced) commentaries, but if we broaden the outlook to academic com-</p>
<p>mentaries since 1995 (the last twenty years), this seems to be the result:</p>
<p>2 essalonians as Authentic: Weima (2014), Shogren (2012), iselton (2010), Fee </p>
<p>(2009), Witherington (2006), Green (2002), Malherbe (2000), Holmes (1998) </p>
<p>2 essalonians as Pseudonymous: urston (2013), Bridges (2008), Furnish (2007), </p>
<p>Richard (2007), Smith (2000), Gaventa (1998) [and we ought to include Menken 1994]</p>
<p>is represents, probably, the real state of the debate that the question about the au-</p>
thorship of 2 essalonians is far from closed, and scholars are nearly evenly divided on
<p>the issue at present. Paul Foster oers results from an informal poll regarding authorship </p>
<p>he conducted at an academic conference. Of the 111 New Testament scholars polled, </p>
<p>Foster reports that 63 percent said “yes” in respect to the question asking whether Paul </p>
<p>was the author in the case of 2 essalonians. Only 13 percent said “no.” And another 35 </p>
<p>percent claimed they were “uncertain.” </p>
<p>102. Bonnie urston prefers to interpret 2 essalonians assuming pseudonymity </p>
<p>and she notes the typical concerns with authenticity. Interestingly, though, she mentions </p>
<p>that, despite the lack of any conclusive evidence, she chooses to follow “the weight of </p>
<p>scholarly opinion” (which she assumes is a consensus against authenticity). Also, she </p>
<p>admits that assuming pseudonymity requires a Sitz im Leben (life setting) for a later </p>
<p>pseudepigrapher, the determination of which “has proved to be a dicult task.” See </p>
<p>urston 1995: 160.</p>
