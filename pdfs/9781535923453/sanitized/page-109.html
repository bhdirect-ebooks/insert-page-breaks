<p>us, many scholars believe that there will not be two appearances</p>
<p>of Christ, but only one, the Day of the Lord.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>e second controversial word is apantēsis. e basic meaning of the </p>
<p>word is not in dispute, it simply translates as “meeting.” However, much </p>
<p>scholarly discussion has swirled around whether this is a technical word </p>
<p>in the Greco-Roman world that refers to the ocial visit of a dignitary </p>
<p>whereby the townspeople go to “meet” this person-of-importance and es-</p>
<p>cort him to the city with an honorary parade. Raymond Collins explains </p>
<p>this imagery </p>
<p>e lord’s arrival in a town, with military escort, was announced </p>
<p>by a herald. A blast from a trumpet would announce the impend-</p>
<p>ing arrival. Perforce the inhabitants of the city would go out to </p>
<p>meet the lord. More oen than not the lord would arrive as a “Sav-</p>
<p>ior” bestowing various benefactions on the citizens.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some scholars have shown skepticism because, while apantēsis (and </p>
<p>words related to it) were sometimes used in reference to such occasions in </p>
<p>Greek literature, the word does not necessarily assume this whole scenario </p>
<p>by virtue of its usage. However, given that Jesus is referred to in 1 ess </p>
<p>4:16–17 as kyrios, lord, a term with strong political resonances, the case </p>
<p>becomes much stronger.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>But what is Paul’s purpose in his borrowing of</p>
<p>this procession motif if Paul did indeed intend it here? Collins continues:</p>
<p>Paul evokes the scene to create an impressive image of the coming </p>
<p>of the Lord. e Lord himself will give the command to start the </p>
<p>parade. e beginning of the parade will be announced with the </p>
<p>archangel’s cry and a blast of the herald’s trumpet. e Lord will be </p>
<p>accompanied by ‘all the saints,’ the heavenly host. e arrival of the </p>
<p>Lord descending from heaven and accompanied by hosts of angels </p>
<p>will be an impressive sight.</p>

<p>21. Scholars who are in favor of reading apantēsis with this imagery in mind include </p>
<p>Bruce 1982: 102–3; Holmes 1998: 151; Witherington 2006: 141; Shogren 2012: 190n.40 </p>
<p>(see also Smith 2004: 48). Less convinced are Wanamaker 1990: 175–76; Malherbe 2000: </p>
<p>277. Best 1986: 199 and Byron 2014 are neutral and open to the possibility, but reluctant </p>
<p>to force such a reading without stronger evidence.</p>
