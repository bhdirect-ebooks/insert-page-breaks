<p>Introduction 21</p>
wrath (orgē) was not about an unbridled divine fury that might break out at any time for any reason. Rather, the divine orgē was about God’s anger
<p>for justice, his disgust at a world spun out of control, and his passion for re-</p>
<p>calibrating the world he created so that it lived according to the standards </p>
<p>of equality and peace for which he originally made it. </p>
<p>Paul warned the essalonians of this impending judgment day, and </p>
<p>instead of them fearing it, they could take heart that Jesus was the Rescuer </p>
<p>and that they were not going to face the judgment of God’s justice-anger </p>
<p>(1:10). ey had the hope of a sure salvation (5:8) because God has made </p>
<p>their position secure through Messiah Jesus (5:9). Instead, those who seek </p>
<p>to do evil, to hinder the reconciling and redeeming gospel, will face wrath </p>
<p>because they do not wish for all to know God’s salvation in Jesus.</p>
<p>Loyalty and Work</p>
<p>Another important theme in 1 essalonians involves pistis and ergon— </p>
<p>“loyalty” and “work.” ere has been an unfortunate tendency in Christian </p>
<p>history in the past few centuries to make “faith” something opposed to </p>
<p>“work,” but in 1 essalonians these words make a happy pair: “work of </p>
<p>trust” (1 ess 1:3). “Work” is the outworking of “trust.” Paul commends </p>
<p>both. eir “trust” is known throughout Macedonia as they follow Jesus </p>
<p>despite great opposition (1:8), and Paul was comforted by Timothy’s “good </p>
<p>news” of their ongoing allegiance to the Messiah (3:6).</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> </p>
<p>First essalonians is most well-known by Christians, and even in </p>
<p>scholarship, for Paul’s teaching about eschatological events. No doubt Paul </p>
<p>gave attention to what is penultimate and ultimate. However, it is unfortu-</p>
<p>nate that his essalonian letters are not equally known for Paul’s teaching </p>
<p>on the importance—and even the goodness—of work. Paul reminds the </p>
<p>essalonians of his work and toil as he made his own living while in town </p>
<p>so as to prevent being a nancial burden on any of them (2:9). We learn </p>
<p>from 1 Corinthians that Paul knew the privileges extended to apostles to </p>
<p>be free from manual labor so as to devote his full attention to preaching </p>
<p>the gospel and equipping churches (see 1 Cor 9:6–7). Paul even goes so </p>
<p>far as to say that the Lord Jesus commanded the apostles to take gis from </p>
<p>believers to support their daily needs—and Paul sometimes chose to “dis-</p>
<p>obey” that command! But why? Why did Paul work? From his ministry in </p>
<p>essalonica we learn that he wanted to stay above reproach when it came </p>
<p>62. On the meaning of pistis in 1 essalonians, see above 10–13.</p>
