<p>Fusing the Horizons: Integrity and Transparency in New Covenant </p>
<p>Leadership</p>
<p>Ecclesiastes has proven itself right over and over again when it attests that </p>
<p>there is nothing new under the sun (1:9). In Paul’s day, there were people of </p>
<p>inﬂuence, power, education, and charisma who took advantage of the masses </p>
<p>and masked greedy motives behind pretenses of benevolence and generosity. </p>
<p>The methods may change over time, but the motives stay the same. Over the </p>
<p>past few years I have been astonished and dismayed by scandal after scandal </p>
<p>making the news regarding pastors who have lied, embezzled, manipulated, </p>
<p>and hoarded for themselves. When called to answer for this behavior we hear </p>
<p>responses like “God has blessed me” and “I did it for the church.” (Cicero </p>
<p>once wrote: “So near is falsehood to truth that a wise man would do well </p>
<p>not to trust himself on the narrow edge” [Academici 4.21].) Paul could not </p>
<p>have imagined a day when pastors and Christian leaders became known for a </p>
<p>multimillion-dollar net worth, or record-breaking book sales. The temptation </p>
<p>to seek the praise of mortals (1 Thess 2:4) is, all too often, overwhelming. One </p>
<p>might beneﬁt, though, from remembering the words of St. Augustine inspired </p>
<p>by 1 Tim 6:6:</p>
<p>On all sides its charms decoy us. We like lots of money, we like </p>
<p>splendid honors, we like power to overawe others. We like all these </p>
<p>things, but let’s listen to the apostle, “We brought nothing into </p>
<p>this world, neither can we take anything out.” [1 Tim 6:6] Honor </p>
<p>should be looking for you, not you for it. You, after all, should </p>
<p>sit down in the humbler place, so he that invited you may make </p>
<p>you go up to a more honored place. But if he doesn’t wish to, eat </p>
<p>where you are sitting, because you brought nothing into this world. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>The model that Paul sets for Christian leaders is timeless: integrity, </p>
<p>transparency, humility, and hard work. Perhaps one of the major problems </p>
<p>that bedevils many modern pastors is the ability to function independent of </p>
<p>accountability. However, the tendency to operate in gray areas is only en-</p>
<p>20. See Gorday 2000: 212. </p>
