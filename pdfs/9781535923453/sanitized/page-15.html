<p>Introduction 3</p>
<p>if one eye looks up and forward towards the future return of the Lord, the </p>
<p>other eye is xed on the earthly work of today. Paul uses the language of </p>
<p>work throughout the letter—the essalonians’ work (1:3), Paul’s unending </p>
<p>manual labor (2:9), the ministry of the apostles (3:5), and the expectation </p>
<p>that all Christians will live daily lives of honest and fruitful productivity </p>
<p>(4:11; 5:13). Christian hope is not star-gazing. Christian hope is not lazy—</p>
<p>Paul made sure of it. Martin Luther echoes a Pauline conviction when he </p>
<p>writes that “Everything that is done in the world is done by hope,” but that </p>
<p>hope is seen in the doing of life.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Christians live in hope, an idea captured remarkably well by Aristotle’s </p>
<p>pithy saying, “Hope is the dream of a waking man.”</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>I think Paul would</p>
<p>have adjusted this a bit to say, “Hope in Jesus is the vision that drives be-</p>
<p>lievers who work and witness in a dark world as they dream of a redeemed </p>
<p>tomorrow” (1 ess 5:8; 2 Cor 5:7).</p>
<p>essalonica and the essalonian Church</p>
<p>e City of essalonica</p>
<p>In 316 BC, essalonica was built on the site of erme below the Hortiates </p>
<p>mountains. Macedonian military leader (and later king) Cassander named </p>
<p>this city he founded aer his wife, the daughter of Philip II and half-sister </p>
<p>of Alexander. anks in no small part to essalonica’s port, it became a </p>
<p>prominent city.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> In 187 BC, King Philip V (221–179) permitted essa-</p>
<p>lonica to issue its own coinage, further boosting its economy. </p>
When Rome took control of Macedonia (168 BC), it was divided into
<p>four republics and essalonica became capital of the second district. In </p>
<p>the following years essalonica made several important political moves; </p>
<p>rstly, it refused to support a revolt against Rome among Macedonian cit-</p>
<p>ies led by Andriscus (149 BC). Instead, it hailed Roman praetor Metellus, </p>
<p>2. Later in the commentary we will demonstrate that Paul was likely inuenced in </p>
<p>his thinking on this matter by the story that Jesus tells in Mark 13:34–37. Even though </p>
<p>1 essalonians was undoubtedly written before Mark, Paul probably knew of this kind </p>
<p>of Jesus tradition. For a case made that Paul was especially drawing from the Jesus tradi-</p>
<p>tion linked to Matthew 24 (more specically), see Shogren 2012: 31–37; cf. Rigaux 1956: </p>
<p>98–101.</p>
