<p>Perseverance and Hope (2 ess 2:1–17) 141</p>
<p>has brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you from </p>
<p>the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Know therefore that the LORD your God is God, the faith-</p>
<p>ful God who maintains covenant loyalty with those who love him </p>
<p>and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations, </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>and </p>
<p>who repays in their own person those who reject him. He does not </p>
<p>delay but repays in their own person those who reject him. (Deut </p>
<p>7:7–10) </p>
<p>No matter what the essalonians were going through, they could </p>
<p>count on the Lord’s covenantal love, a love that does not waver, is not ckle, </p>
<p>is not evanescent. ese Gentile essalonians were written into the story </p>
<p>of Israel, so to speak, by virtue of their faith in and loyalty to Messiah Jesus. </p>
<p>And, to borrow a line from Romans, if God is for us, who can be against us </p>
<p>(Rom 8:31)?</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Secondly, Paul points out that God chose these essalonians to be the </p>
<p>“rst fruits” for salvation.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>What does he mean by this? Again, the imagery</p>
<p>derives from worship language in the Old Testament. Israel was oen called </p>
<p>upon by God to bring forth the rst fruits of their eld labors as a sign of </p>
<p>trust and commitment to the Lord (e.g., see Deut 26:1–16; Neh 10:37). In </p>
<p>the context here of 2 essalonians, for Paul to call them “rst fruits,” he is </p>
<p>most likely referring to the fact that they are the rst believers in Jesus in </p>
<p>essalonica.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>is, in and of itself, would be a privilege and would help</p>
<p>them to see the amazing work God has been doing all along to make a </p>
<p>people for himself in that place. Furthermore, given that the essalonians </p>
<p>were being persecuted, no doubt they felt alone; one thinks here of the </p>
<p>plight of Elijah who complains to the Lord that he is all alone, rejected by </p>
<p>those around him (1 Kings 19:10, 14). But, just as God desired to comfort </p>
<p>Elijah, so Paul undoubtedly was eager to encourage the essalonians—</p>
<p>there will be more! To call the essalonians “rst fruits” is to say that, not </p>
<p>only have they blazed a trail for more to come, but surely there will be more </p>

<p>36. Some Greek manuscripts have a slightly dierent reading here: “he chose you </p>
<p>from the beginning” (so see NET, RSV). Textual critics are in disagreement on which </p>
<p>reading (“from the beginning” or “rst-fruits”) is original; it would seem that there is </p>
<p>a little more support for the “rst-fruits” reading, hence the translation choice in this </p>
<p>commentary. However, it is interesting to note that Ambrosiaster, writing probably in </p>
<p>the late fourth century AD, knew this verse to read “from the beginning” and comments: </p>
<p>“He has known from the beginning who would become believers and which of them will </p>
<p>increase in faith and not decrease”; see Bray 2009: 116; cf. also Chrysostom, Homily 4.</p>
<p>37. See Gaventa 1998: 121.</p>
