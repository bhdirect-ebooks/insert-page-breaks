<p>Excursus: Hypothesizing a Clandestine Attack 15</p>
<p>how some people died at once. It could also explain why some are “weak” </p>
<p>(injured?) and others are “faint hearted” (5:14). Furthermore, what if these </p>
<p>same Jews blamed this ﬁre on “the wrath of God” because these god-fearers </p>
<p>began to follow Paul and worship Messiah Jesus (whom these Jews would </p>
<p>have considered a false messiah)? What if these Jews tried to convince the </p>
<p>Thessalonian believers that they could reclaim “peace and security” if they </p>
<p>forsook Jesus and returned to the synagogue (5:3)? What if Jewish prophets </p>
<p>“prophesied” further doom if they did not (see 5:20–21)? Paul’s wider mes-</p>
<p>sage would be clear in response to this: Jesus is Lord, he is judge, salvation </p>
<p>and hope are centered on him.</p>
<p>Coming of the Lord</p>
<p>e last major concern that Paul raises relates to the timing of the com-</p>
<p>ing of the Lord (5:1–11). Paul is unwilling to say more than that it will be </p>
<p>unexpected (5:2–3). He turns their attention away from timetable theories </p>
<p>towards faithfulness and upright behavior today. e timing doesn’t matter </p>
<p>if, in waiting for the master, you are always at work in your duties (see Luke </p>
<p>12:41–48). Somewhere along the way, a fear struck them that they might </p>
<p>not be ready. Paul comforts them by reminding them of their rmly-an-</p>
<p>chored identity in the Messiah (5:9), but challenges them to live faithfully </p>
<p>in light of that identity.</p>
<p>Minor Concerns? </p>
<p>e above issues (persecution, sexual purity, the dead in the Messiah, the </p>
<p>coming of the Lord) are Paul’s main concerns in 1 essalonians, but po-</p>
<p>tentially he was also addressing other, minor matters. For example, there is </p>
some evidence that the church may have had internal divisions and com-
<p>munal problems; Paul seems to briey address these (see 4:9–11; 5:12–15). </p>
<p>Also, Paul may have had a small concern for those he calls ataktoi (“the </p>
<p>idle troublemakers”), but his mention of them is brief enough that it is not </p>
<p>signicant at this point for him (5:14; it becomes a major problem by the </p>
<p>time he writes 2 essalonians). Also, is it possible that the essalonian </p>
<p>believers had been thrown into confusion by (false?) prophecies (5:20–21)? </p>
<p>Again, this is plausible, but the brief mention oers little information.</p>
