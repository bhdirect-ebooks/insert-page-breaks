<p>Mission and Community (2 Thess 3:1–18)</p>
<p>In the second chapter of this letter, Paul took his discourse into the strato-</p>
<p>sphere to provide a glimpse into the cosmic realm of an apocalyptic en-</p>
<p>gagement between the Lord Jesus and Satan’s Lawless One. Here, in the </p>
<p>third and nal chapter, Paul touches back down onto terra rma to provide </p>
<p>some nal exhortation and instructions—and encouragement—for this </p>
<p>distraught church in essalonica.</p>
<p>He treats three main topics. First, he asks for prayer for the apostolic </p>
<p>mission and the worldwide glorication of the gospel (3:1–2). Secondly, he </p>
<p>appeals to the essalonians to put their trust in their trustworthy Father </p>
<p>God and the Messiah Jesus (3:3–5). Finally, Paul warns the essalonians </p>
<p>not to associate with or go the way of those in the church he refers to as </p>
<p>“idle” (atakteō). e problem was not just that these believers were not </p>
<p>working (3:10), but that they were refusing to work and, instead of working, </p>
<p>they meddled and became mere busybodies (3:11). While such were not </p>
<p>meant to be pushed out of the community (3:15), they ought to be cor-</p>
<p>rected and recognized as disobedient to apostolic teaching (3:6–7). </p>
<p>Paul’s nal teaching “word” comes in 3:16 and strikes the right note </p>
<p>regarding why he takes such a stern approach to the troublemakers and </p>
<p>disobedient in the church. His desire is to see a healthy church that models </p>
<p>holiness and integrity. e church cannot be the church unless it lives in </p>
<p>peace. us, he concludes with a shalom-benediction: “Now may the Lord </p>
<p>of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. e Lord be with all </p>
<p>of you” (3:16).</p>
<p>Hoping in the Faithful Lord (3:1–5)</p>
<p>Finally, my dear brothers and sisters, pray for us, so that the word </p>
<p>of the Lord may sprint forward and be gloried everywhere, just as </p>
<p>it did among you, </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>and pray that we be rescued from wicked and </p>
<p>evil people; for loyalty does not belong to everyone. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>But the Lord </p>
<p>is faithful; he will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>And we have condence in the Lord concerning you, that you are </p>
