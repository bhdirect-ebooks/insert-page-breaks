<p>doctrinal orthodoxy. In 1:4, Paul mentions their pistis again along with </p>
<p>their hypomonē (perseverance). Pistis and hypomonē seem to function as a </p>
<p>hendiadys and can be translated as something like loyal endurance (loyalty </p>
<p>[pistis] + endurance [hypomonē])—there is an active, observable nature to </p>
<p>this pistis.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>As for their agapē, Paul notes that they are excelling in love, and his </p>
<p>emphasis is on reciprocity and mutuality. In reference to both of these, </p>
<p>“loyalty” and “love,” Paul is probably making the case that the suering </p>
<p>they are experiencing has not plunged their community into chaos; rather, </p>
<p>by the grace of God, they are marching forward in honor of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>According to 1:4, Paul informs the essalonians of his boast before </p>
<p>the other churches regarding their “loyal endurance” in the face of resis-</p>
<p>tance. e language of persecution is found here, but it is unclear what </p>
<p>kind of aictions are involved. Todd Still, in his extensive research on the </p>
<p>subject, makes this conclusion about the persecution: “it is best understood </p>
<p>as vigorous, non-Christian opposition which likely took the form of verbal </p>
<p>harassment, social ostracism, political sanctions and perhaps (some kind </p>
<p>of) physical abuse.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> In light of these aictions, Paul turns the essalo-</p>
<p>nians’ attention away from shame and disgrace by expressing his pride in </p>
<p>their tenacity, spiritual resilience, and faithfulness to God.</p>

<p>5</p>
<p>is is a sign of the right judgment of God, so that you may be </p>
<p>worthy of the kingdom of God, the kingdom on behalf of which </p>
<p>you are suering. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>For it is right for God to repay troublemakers </p>
<p>with trouble, </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>and for you who are troubled it is right for God to </p>
<p>give you relief along with us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from </p>
<p>heaven with his mighty angels; </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>his revealing will be with a ery </p>
<p>ame, dispensing retribution to those who do not know God and </p>
<p>those who do not obey the good news of our Lord Jesus. </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>ey </p>
<p>will pay the penalty of permanent destruction, separated from </p>
<p>the presence of the Lord and from his glorious power </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>when he </p>
<p>comes on that day to be gloried among his holy people and to be </p>
<p>an object of glorious wonder by all those who have believed. And </p>
<p>this includes you, because our testimony to you was believed. </p>
