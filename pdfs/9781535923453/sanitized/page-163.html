<p>Mission and Community (2 ess 3:1–18) 151</p>
<p>e antidote to this meddlesome lifestyle is to work quietly and earn </p>
<p>your own living (2:12; cf. 1 ess 4:11). To work “quietly” (meta ēsuxias) </p>
<p>does not refer literally to low decibels, but rather implies working for its </p>
<p>own goodness and productivity rather than to attract attention; so Fee ex-</p>
<p>plains, it is about “not disturbing the shalom of the community by ‘spong-</p>
<p>ing’ o other believers.”</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Paul goes on to call the essalonians to do what is the right thing, to </p>
<p>persevere even though it is hard to face challenges (3:13; cf. Gal 6:9). Even </p>
<p>though Paul may be thinking in general terms (always do what is right), </p>
<p>looking at the context of 2 ess 3:6–15, one can’t help but think that Paul </p>
<p>is specically addressing this problem with the idle troublemakers. What </p>
<p>is “right” could be having that dicult talk with these troublemakers and </p>
<p>show them they are disruptive. However, it could also be that “doing what </p>
<p>is right” means having a tender and caring heart for them in spite of their </p>
<p>unruliness. Howard Marshall writes, “is would be entirely in accord with </p>
<p>the early Christian spirit of showing love to those who do not deserve it and </p>
<p>do not return it. Paul thus deals with the situation of idleness in the church, </p>
<p>not by telling the church to cut o supplies to the idlers but by admonishing </p>
<p>the idlers to change their ways.”</p>

<p>Peace Benediction and Pauline Authentication (3:16–18)</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in </p>
<p>all ways. e Lord be with all of you. </p>
<p>17</p>
<p>I, Paul, write this greeting </p>
<p>with my own hand. is is the mark in every letter of mine; it is </p>
<p>the way I write. </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>e grace of our Lord Messiah Jesus be with all </p>
<p>of you. </p>
<p>As with many of his letters, here Paul concludes with a reiteration of </p>
<p>one of the key themes of the epistle: peace. e essalonians, due to some </p>
<p>communication, were whipped up into a frenzy thinking that the wrath of </p>
<p>God was imminent. Paul’s word for them is peace, shalom. God is not a God </p>
<p>who relishes in damnation or stirring up problems. Rather, he is the God </p>
<p>who moves his sin-broken world towards harmony. At any given moment, </p>
<p>life may not seem very peaceful, but there is much comfort in the presence </p>
