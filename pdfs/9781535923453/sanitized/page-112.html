<p>Fusing the Horizons: e New Covenant People of Hope100</p>
<p>ness has been unleashed. This is our darkest day and our ﬁnest </p>
<p>hour.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>This tenacious clinging to hope, expressed above in 2014, is mirrored </p>
<p>in these lines from William Cowper’s eighteenth-century poem called “Hope.”</p>
<p>These shall last when night has quench’d the pole,</p>
<p>And heav’n is all departed as a scroll:</p>
<p>And when, as justice has long since decreed,</p>
<p>This earth shall blaze, and a new world succeed,</p>
<p>Then these thy glorious works, and they who share</p>
<p>That hope which can alone exclude despair,</p>
<p>Shall live exempt from weakness and decay,</p>
<p>The brightest wonders of an endless day. </p>
