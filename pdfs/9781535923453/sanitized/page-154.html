<p>to come; aer all, as Raymond Collins notes, “First fruits are the harbinger </p>
<p>of the harvest to follow.”</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>e path God has laid out for them involves consecration by the Spirit </p>
<p>and by trust in the truth. is is Paul’s way of helping the essalonians to </p>
<p>see what is right and good from God’s perspective, not from the viewpoint </p>
<p>of mere mortals. As much as neighbors, “friends,” and enemies are telling </p>
<p>them—this new religion is bizarre, suspicious, a distraction, harmful—Paul, </p>
<p>on the other hand, tells the essalonians—see with new eyes, listen to the </p>
<p>Spirit, search for the truth (about Jesus and about what Jesus means for un-</p>
<p>derstanding who God is and how to understand His world). To walk by the </p>
<p>Spirit is to live intentionally in a way contrary to the so-called “truth” of the </p>
<p>world; it is to walk by faith and to walk blindly, but by blindly Paul means </p>
<p>living according to the invisible reality of God (2 Cor 5:7).</p>
<p>An important nal word of comfort Paul oers the essalonians is </p>
<p>that they are called to share in the glory of Messiah Jesus. As noted in 2 </p>
<p>ess 1:5–10, the plight of believers-in-Jesus is, indeed, to suer in this </p>
<p>world, but suering and shame are not the last words; earlier Paul pointed </p>
<p>to relief (2 ess 1:7), and continues on to explain the judgment of Messiah </p>
<p>Jesus against the essalonians persecutors (1:8–9) and the worst forces of </p>
<p>evil (2:8). Here he explicitly acknowledges that the essalonians’ nal state </p>
<p>will be glory. </p>
<p>Aer explicating their secure identity, consecration, and vocation </p>
<p>in Jesus (2:13–14), Paul gives his charge: “So then, my dear brothers and </p>
<p>sisters, stand rm and hold rmly to the traditions which you were taught </p>
<p>whether by word or a letter from us!” e problem is obviously that the </p>
<p>essalonians were growing faint of heart and losing their condence </p>
<p>and zeal for the Jesus way, mostly due to outside pressure, resistance, and </p>
<p>shame. Paul, like an army commander to a weary troop, on the brink of </p>
<p>“breaking rank,” inspires perseverance. It is signicant that he enjoins the </p>
<p>essalonians not simply to trust him, but the traditions of the apostles.</p>

<p>39. For more on the language of tradition in the New Testament, see Humphrey </p>
<p>2013; Best argues that Paul’s reference here to “traditions” includes central doctrines, </p>
<p>though need not be limited to eschatology per se. Best observes that Paul’s reference to </p>
<p>“our gospel” implies that the traditions in question relate to “the central teaching of the </p>
<p>meaning of Jesus Christ (1986: 317; see 1 ess 2:13; Col 2:6; Gal 1:9).</p>
