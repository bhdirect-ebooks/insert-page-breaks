<p>Paul’s Love, Pride, and Concern (1 ess 2:17—3:13) 71</p>
<p>redemptive purposes. God intends not just to work in spite of problems, </p>
<p>but especially through problems as the faith of believers is strengthened </p>
<p>by trials</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>—so much so that Paul could write to the Romans that believers </p>
<p>can boast in their troubles and aictions because God uses these things to </p>
<p>produce godly character (see Rom 5:3–4).</p>
<p>Paul recounts how Timothy returned to him with news that the es-</p>
<p>salonians were, in fact, enduring (3:6). Quite noticeably in the Greek text, </p>
<p>Paul uses the word euangelizomai, a verb he employs almost exclusively for </p>
<p>“preaching the good news.” e verb euangelizomai appears about twenty </p>
<p>times in his letters in the New Testament, but only here does he use it in </p>
<p>reference to something other than the good news of Messiah Jesus (the </p>
<p>message of salvation). It has, in a sense, a mundane meaning in 1 ess 3:6: </p>
<p>Timothy shared the pleasing message (or happy news) of the essalonians’ </p>
<p>perseverance. However, because Paul tends to use language of “good news” </p>
<p>for the gospel of Messiah Jesus (i.e., as a sort of technical term), one can-</p>
<p>not help but draw that nuance into 1 ess 3:6 as well. Timothy sharing a </p>
<p>pleasing message about the essalonians is part of the ongoing work of the </p>
<p>sharing of the gospel because it is the same Spirit that inspires their endur-</p>
<p>ance and the same Messiah Jesus that models and guides their love. It is a </p>
<p>beautiful thing for Paul’s converts to be responsible for the “good news” to </p>
<p>be preached to Paul on account of their faithfulness and obedience!</p>
<p>Paul is relieved and pleased to hear from Timothy that, not only </p>
<p>have the essalonians been enduring, but they acknowledge and fondly </p>
<p>remember Paul’s love for them and they want to see him just as much as </p>
<p>he does them (3:6b). e language of longing (epiptheō) is the language </p>
<p>of intimacy and close friendship. is is the same verb used in the Greek </p>
<p>translation (Septuagint) of Ps 42:1: “As the deer longs (epipotheō) for the </p>
<p>streams of water, my soul also for you, O God.” Paul and the essalonians </p>
<p>have a deep, almost unquenchable thirst for being in fellowship together in </p>
<p>one place. </p>
<p>Paul, Timothy, and Silas could nd some comfort in their anxieties </p>
<p>when they came to know of the essalonians’ pistis—a word normally </p>
<p>translated “faith,” but here seems to refer to their faithfulness, loyalty, and </p>
<p>condent hope in God through Jesus (3:7).</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Paul’s next statement could</p>
<p>be rather shocking to some modern readers: “For now we feel alive again, </p>
<p>knowing you stand rm in the Lord” (3:8; cf. 4:1). What does this mean? </p>
