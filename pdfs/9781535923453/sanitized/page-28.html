<p>Paul on Trial?</p>
<p>A nal matter worth considering as a reason for 1 essalonians pertains </p>
<p>to whether Paul felt the need to defend himself (especially in order to </p>
<p>maintain the integrity of the gospel he preached). Many scholars, including </p>
<p>myself, detect a defensive tone in Paul’s self-description in 2:1–12. Paul felt </p>
<p>the need to say that he was not deceitful, nor did he resort to trickery. He </p>
<p>was not a atterer, nor motivated by greed or popularity. He did not want </p>
<p>their money and tried to remain blameless before them. In chapter three, </p>
<p>he communicates his relief when he heard the report from Timothy that </p>
<p>the essalonians remembered him fondly and wanted to see him (3:6).</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But why would Paul feel the need to defend his integrity? Perhaps, </p>
<p>when he had to ee spontaneously at night (see Acts 17:10a), suspicions </p>
<p>arose about Paul’s sudden disappearance. As Michael Holmes explains, </p>
<p>Paul was concerned </p>
<p>that his behavior and that of his companions might be misunder-</p>
<p>stood—or, more likely, misrepresented—in a way that would call </p>
<p>into question the validity and integrity of the gospel itself. Religious </p>
<p>charlatans and frauds were a dime a dozen in the ancient world, </p>
<p>and the way Paul and Silas slipped out of town in the middle of the </p>
<p>night would have made it only too easy to pigeonhole them as just </p>
<p>one more pair of rip-o artists out to scam people. From there it </p>
<p>was only a short step to the conclusion that their message was no </p>
<p>more truthful than they were, and thus the people might reject it </p>
<p>along with them.</p>

<p>Images and emes in 1 essalonians</p>
<p>ere is no denying that Paul loved using metaphors and images to help </p>
<p>his churches understand their identity in God through Messiah.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>He loved</p>
<p>to use word pictures to capture what it means to serve Messiah Jesus. His </p>
<p>letters are peppered with dozens of metaphors, but we can easily identify </p>
<p>three key “images” that dominate 1 essalonians in particular: family, </p>
<p>cult, and military.</p>
