<p>Excursus: “Sibling Love” (philadelphia) 85</p>
<p>fact which rouses your spleen—because we are men of the one and same God </p>
<p>the Father, copartners in faith, coheirs in hope.”</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Writing a few decades after Paul’s ﬁrst letter to the Thessalonians, Greek </p>
<p>historian and moralist Plutarch produced an essay called Peri philadelphia/</p>
<p>De fraterno amore—“On brotherly love.” Plutarch underscores how a sibling </p>
<p>relationship is superior to one of friendship because brothers and sisters </p>
<p>are bound together within the same family and have a special obligation to </p>
<p>love and protect one another. As Reidar Aasgaard explains, Plutarch notes </p>
<p>that a sibling form of love is necessarily characterized by “tolerance, loyalty, </p>
<p>and forgiveness.”</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>This is noticeably relevant to what Paul has to say to the</p>
<p>Thessalonians, especially when there may have been situations where some </p>
<p>were inappropriately taking advantage of others in the church. Thus, reinforc-</p>
<p>ing their siblingship relationship in the Messiah, Paul would be reinforcing </p>
<p>what can be called “other-regarding morality.”</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>In 4:9, Paul mentions that they hardly need explicit instruction because </p>
<p>they have been “God-taught.”</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>What does this mean? Some have proposed</p>
<p>that Paul is referring to particular “love” teachings from the Old Testament </p>
<p>or to Jesus’ earthly words about love recorded and passed down in the Jesus </p>
<p>tradition, but this seems unlikely because Paul appears to be comparing </p>
normal human instruction with a unique kind of divine instruction. If Paul
<p>were referring to Jesus’ teachings or Old Testament instruction, the es-</p>
<p>salonians would have learned it from Paul’s own apostolic instruction, and </p>
<p>then it would be unclear why he would calls this “God-taught.”</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Rather, it</p>
<p>seems most probable that Paul is talking about the inward, transformative </p>
<p>work of the Spirit. John Calvin captures this idea with particular eloquence:</p>
<p>eir hearts were framed for love; so that it appears that the Holy </p>
<p>Spirit inwardly dictates ecaciously what is to be done, so that </p>
<p>there is no need to give injunctions in writing.</p>
