<p>Excursus: Work and Quietness 89</p>
<p>such clubs, it was common for members to compete for status and privilege </p>
<p>(in terms of social value and honor). In reference to “aspire to live quietly” </p>
<p>(4:11), Ascough notes a Greek inscription related to a voluntary association </p>
<p>which reads: “let the association increase by aspirations.” The word used here </p>
<p>for “aspirations” (philoteimia) is related to the word Paul employs in 1 Thess </p>
<p>4:11 for “aspire” (philotime</p>
<p>ō</p>
<p>). In the voluntary associations, it was expected </p>
<p>that members competed for honor and status—it was obviously encouraged. If </p>
<p>Ascough is right, Paul would have been discouraging Christians from engaging </p>
<p>in races for honor and status. </p>
<p>My concern with Ascough’s theory is that the terminology of aspiration </p>
<p>(philoteimia) is quite common and does not restrict Paul’s language to that of </p>
<p>the association. Rather, I think Bruce Winter’s theory has more to commend </p>
<p>it. Winter argues that believers should not forsake regular work in view of tying </p>
<p>themselves to wealthy benefactors. Ben Witherington supports Winter’s view </p>
<p>and expresses Paul’s reasoning in this way.</p>
<p>They were to be quietly busy, not busybodies, which is to say not </p>
<p>living on the dole of some patron and then spending their time </p>
<p>spreading the patron’s name around and seeking to win friends </p>
<p>and inﬂuence people for the patron. Christians, by contrast to the </p>
<p>patron-client system, were all to work as they were able, avoid </p>
<p>being a burden to others, and earn money to do good to others </p>
<p>without thought of return. Love and doing good to all, especially </p>
<p>the household of faith, rather than reciprocity, was to be their </p>
<p>guiding principle.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The reality in Thessalonica may have been that some tragedy struck the </p>
<p>Christian community (leading to unexpected deaths), for some reason some </p>
<p>community members were stirred up by eschatological concerns, and in a </p>
<p>troubled state they came to over-rely on patrons as they tried to discern what </p>
<p>was going on. Paul’s counsel to these is, to borrow a British morale-boosting </p>
<p>motto, “keep calm and carry on.” Despite unanswered questions, even amidst </p>
<p>the confusion and chaos, the life of the community requires consistency and </p>
<p>self-discipline. As Richard Hays writes, “The eschatological hope should leave </p>
<p>them, according to Paul, neither in a state of passivity nor in a state of fevered </p>
<p>striving; instead, they should gladly acknowledge that God is at work among </p>
<p>church (6–16).</p>
