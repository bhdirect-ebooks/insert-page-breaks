<p>anksgiving for the essalonians (1 ess 1:1–10) 42</p>
<p>are running low on endurance” (17:24). Paul prays the same kind of hope </p>
<p>continues to push them that is seen in the Ephesian church of Revelation </p>
<p>2:2–3: “I know your deeds, your hard work and your endurance . . . I also </p>
<p>know you are enduring patiently and bearing up for the sake of my name, </p>
<p>and that you have not grown weary.”</p>
<p>e main purpose of this introductory discussion (1:2–10) is encour-</p>
<p>agement and comfort. He does this in 1:3 by appealing to their history of </p>
<p>trust in God, but in 1:4 he also underscores God’s relationship with them. </p>
<p>ree descriptors are used here. First, they are “my dear brothers and sis-</p>
<p>ters.” is is probably Paul’s most central image used in 1 essalonians to </p>
<p>help re-describe their special identity in Messiah Jesus—he refers to them </p>
<p>as Christian siblings almost two dozen times across the ve chapters. ey </p>
<p>have been adopted into a single family and household under God the Fa-</p>
<p>ther (1:1) through Jesus the Son (1:10), so that Jesus could become “the </p>
<p>rstborn among many brothers and sisters” (Rom 8:29). </p>
<p>What does it mean to be brothers and sisters in the Messiah? In the </p>
<p>Greco-Roman world, there were few relationships more intimate and im-</p>
<p>portant than that of siblings—not only were they close through spending </p>
<p>time together growing up, but there was an almost instinctual desire to </p>
<p>protect and seek out the welfare of one’s brother or sister. When someone </p>
<p>was in times of trouble, siblings could be counted on for aid and encour-</p>
<p>agement. While Paul himself writes to them as a brother in the Messiah, </p>
<p>someone with deep concern, he also strongly exhorts them to take care of </p>
<p>one another (4:9, 18; 5:11, 15) in a way that was really only true of family </p>
<p>members in the wider world.</p>

<p>Fusing the Horizons: Blood-Blind in the New Covenant Community</p>
<p>A letter like Galatians reminds us that Christians are “color-blind,” not </p>
<p>privileging Jews over Gentiles as fellow-heirs of the kingdom of God. In 1 </p>
<p>Thessalonians we are reminded that Christians are “blood-blind,” we are </p>
<p>meant to treat fellow believers like family. In Paul’s world, as in ours, people </p>
<p>tended to care for their family in a way not true of outsiders (the proverb “blood </p>
<p>is thicker than water” makes good sense in just about any culture). What hap-</p>
<p>pens when Paul links perfect strangers by the bond of siblingship? They are </p>
<p>not kin biologically, but the sheer frequency of use of this language from Paul </p>
<p>7. See further Trebilco 2012: 16–66.</p>
