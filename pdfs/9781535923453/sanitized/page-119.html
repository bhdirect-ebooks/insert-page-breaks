<p>e Day of the Lord: Preparedness and Perseverance, not Prediction 107</p>
<p>e “armor” that the essalonian believers wear consists of loyalty, </p>
<p>love, and hope—the Pauline triad of virtues that rst appeared in 1 ess </p>
<p>1:3.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>So, here at the close of the letter, Paul returns to the attitudinal and</p>
<p>behavioral distinctives that already characterize the essalonians. Paul </p>
<p>simply emphasizes that the key to vanquishing their fears lies in the power </p>
<p>of these virtues rather than any kind of preparation based on knowing dates </p>
<p>and times. By reminding the essalonians that God has destined them </p>
for salvation and not divine anger, he is arming again (see 1 ess 1:4)
<p>their identity in the Messiah. Almost certainly the tragic recent events (that </p>
<p>involved the death of some in their community) made some wonder if God </p>
<p>was on their side or against them. Paul directs their attention to the fact of </p>
<p>their security in and through Jesus who died for them (5:9–10). Not only </p>
<p>did he give his life for their salvation, but he will be with them forever. </p>
<p>e nal word he oers in this section is the exhortation to encour-</p>
<p>age and build one another up (5:11). Mutuality and other-centeredness lies </p>
<p>at the heart of Paul’s concern. He is quick to acknowledge that they have </p>
<p>already demonstrated faithfulness in these areas, but perhaps the “fog” of </p>
<p>their current concerns clouded their vision of these standards and goals. In </p>
<p>the next section of the letter (5:12–22), Paul gets into more detail regarding </p>
<p>what this community-orientation requires—respect towards leaders, set-</p>
<p>ting the rebellious straight, comfort for the discouraged, dedication to the </p>
<p>weak, patience and peace overall. </p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: War and Peace: The New Covenant </p>
<p>Community in Action</p>
<p>Oftentimes, when I read Bible stories to my children at night, I am struck </p>
<p>anew by how violent and even gruesome the Bible can be. Cain murdering </p>
<p>Abel. A devastating ﬂood. Death in Jericho by wall and weapon. The decapi-</p>
<p>tation of Goliath. If the Old Testament were a movie, it would certainly be </p>
<p>R-rated for violence! It is no wonder many Christians prefer to read the New </p>
<p>Testament, trusting in the “meek and mild” Jesus. Yes, certainly we do not </p>
<p>get bloody battle scenes in the gospels and, yes, Jesus is depicted as patient </p>
<p>and non-violent when he goes to the cross as a sheep to slaughter. In keeping </p>
<p>drunk spiritually is to imbibe too much of the world’s way of looking at things and not </p>
<p>enough of the way God views reality.”</p>
