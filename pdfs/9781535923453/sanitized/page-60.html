<p>optional practice to be added on to previous values and commit-</p>
<p>ments. One cannot serve this God alongside idols; they must be </p>
<p>put away. e claims of Christian faith are all-encompassing.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When they turned towards the one God, they committed themselves </p>
<p>to “serve a new master” (douleuō). To call this slave-service was not to </p>
<p>imagine this as cruel, de-humanizing slavery, but more like the joy a trained </p>
<p>soldier experiences under a professional, if demanding, senior ocer who </p>
<p>knows what it takes to carry out a mission successfully. Howard Marshall </p>
<p>notes that this kind of service is life-giving because its focus is on the doing </p>
<p>of what is good and right, rather than “being in bondage to sin.”</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>To become a slave of Yahweh is to be written into the story that Scrip-</p>
<p>ture tells, which involves the covenant with Israel and which reaches a </p>
<p>climax with the appearance of Messiah Jesus. While Jesus’ (rst) coming </p>
<p>launched a new phase in salvation history, he ascended into heaven and </p>
<p>promised to return again. </p>
<p>We read in 1 ess 1:10 that Paul commends these believers who </p>
<p>turned to God as they “wait eagerly for his Son to come from heaven, the </p>
<p>one God raised from the realm of the dead, Jesus who will rescue us from </p>
<p>God’s coming anger for justice.” ere is a kind of passive dimension of the </p>
<p>word “wait” (anamenō) here (as in “to stay put”; Judith 7.12), but Paul prob-</p>
<p>ably uses it in a more transformative manner. ey live their lives in eager </p>
<p>anticipation of Jesus’ return; they have re-oriented their lives around this </p>
<p>arrival.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>e kingdom of God is a kind of invisible reality because Jesus is</p>
<p>in heaven and it appears like the worldly powers are in control. To wait for, </p>
<p>or anticipate, Jesus’ return means living according to an alternative vision </p>
<p>of power and value that is unseen, but is surely to come. e essalonians </p>
<p>have shown signs of aligning with this not-yet kingdom even under pres-</p>
<p>sure and aiction. e tables will turn, so to speak, when Jesus returns be-</p>
<p>cause God is coming with wrath (“anger for justice”; 1:10b). God’s wrath, or </p>
<p>anger, is not borne out of an unbridled temper, but the justice-orientation </p>
<p>of God towards a rebellious world.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Paul preached an impending assize</p>
<p>that would call the world to account for its hedonism, bloodlust, oppression </p>
<p>of the weak and poor, and rejection of the authority and wisdom of God. </p>
