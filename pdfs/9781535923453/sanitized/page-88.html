<p>Fusing the Horizons: Life Together76</p>
<p>riches must invariably open up for those who by God’s will are </p>
<p>privileged to live in daily community life with other Christians!</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Again, keeping in mind that some believers around the world are less for-</p>
<p>tunate and do not have the privilege of regular Christian fellowship, Bonhoeffer </p>
<p>enjoins us who do have a church community to count our blessings.</p>
<p>Therefore, let those who until now have had the privilege of living </p>
<p>a Christian life together with other Christians praise God’s grace </p>
<p>from the bottom of their hearts. Let them thank God on their knees </p>
<p>and realize: it is grace, nothing but grace, that we are still permit-</p>
<p>ted to live in the community of Christians today.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As Bonhoeffer suggests, we should cherish Christian fellowship when </p>
<p>we see how people like Paul hungered and thirsted for the Thessalonians. We </p>
<p>also should remind ourselves that Paul had this longing because he opened </p>
<p>himself up to sharing life together with the Thessalonians. Fellowship, for </p>
<p>Paul, was not an event, but a means of life itself. May we dare to entrust </p>
<p>ourselves to our fellow believers and share our deepest selves (1 Thess 2:8) </p>
<p>with our brothers and sisters such that they become life to us and we to them. </p>
<p>And may we thank God that we can.</p>

<p>23. Ibid., 30. In the same section of the book, Bonhoeer quotes Martin Luther (one </p>
<p>of his favorite theologians) who commented that church fellowship is one of the “roses </p>
<p>and lilies” of the Christian life; see Ibid., 31.</p>
