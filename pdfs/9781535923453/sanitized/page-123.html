<p>Final Instruction (1 ess 5:12–28) 111</p>
<p>Now, when we see Paul refer, in a rapid-re sort of way, to a series </p>
<p>of broad comments—rejoice, pray, discern carefully—it does give a kind of </p>
<p>one-size-ts-all impression. However, clearly other things he talks about in </p>
<p>this section seem more contextually-focused, regarding, for example, the </p>
<p>“rebellious idle.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Below we will also discuss other themes and key terms</p>
<p>from earlier in the letter that reappear in the nal section of the letter. So, </p>
<p>is Paul writing generically or specically? e most likely scenario is that </p>
<p>there is some of both going on here. Most of the Gentile churches to which </p>
<p>Paul ministered would have beneted from all kinds of general advice </p>
<p>about holiness, purity, peace, and love. ink of the American missionary </p>
<p>on furlough who travels around the United States and speaks at numer-</p>
<p>ous supporting-churches. She is bound to tell the same stories and give </p>
<p>the same kind of encouragement and wisdom. However, there are enough </p>
<p>unique, peculiar, or specic elements in this section that convince me that </p>
<p>this is more than generic counsel per se, as Paul appears to be addressing </p>
<p>local issues. One more caveat is warranted. To say that Paul was writing </p>
<p>with a specic focus on the essalonian community does not presume </p>
<p>that problems were severe or that Paul had all the information he wanted </p>
<p>or needed about their lifestyle and behavior. We should entertain the pos-</p>
<p>sibility that Paul combined general apostolic wisdom with concrete things </p>
<p>he heard from Timothy’s report, as well as even some guesses as to what the </p>
<p>essalonians may have been struggling with.</p>

<p>Leadership and Life Together (5:12–15)</p>
<p>is initial section of the nal instructions oers an important, albeit small, </p>
<p>glimpse into the inner workings of life in the church in the rst century. </p>
<p>Paul gives instruction regarding how the church in essalonica should </p>
<p>show proper respect for the leadership. Beginning, as he so oen does in </p>
<p>this letter, with his exhortation to his beloved “brothers and sisters” (adel-</p>
<p>phoi), he encourages them to acknowledge their leaders, the ones who carry </p>
<p>the responsibility of looking aer them. It is vital to note that Paul presents </p>
<p>them as people who toil or labor (kopiaō) in their midst. Hard work is a vir-</p>
<p>tue that Paul has repeatedly noted throughout the letter (1:3; 2:9; 3:5), and </p>
<p>1. See Malherbe 2000: 309.</p>
<p>2. Many modern interpreters of Paul opt for this both-and approach to Paul’s nal </p>
<p>instructions here; see Wanamaker 1990: 191; Furnish 2007: 114; Fee 2009: 201–2. For a </p>
<p>methodology discussion regarding how to reconstruct the historical situation based on </p>
<p>the text (as possible), see Gupta 2012: 361–81.</p>
