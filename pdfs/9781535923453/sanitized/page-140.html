<p>Fusing the Horizons: Can Suering for the Kingdom be a Blessing?128</p>
<p>news this month that an American televangelist hit national headlines with his </p>
<p>request for his megachurch to help him buy a new private jet for his family to </p>
<p>do international ministry—a “Gulfstream G650,” the fastest, most luxurious, </p>
<p>longest range and most technologically advanced jet known to humankind, </p>
<p>with a price tag of $65 million. Is this the destiny of believers and the model </p>
<p>of a pastor—luxury and wealth, a life of comfort and ease?</p>
<p>In 2 Thess 1:3–5, Paul seems to link suffering with being worthy of the </p>
<p>kingdom of God. At the very least, Paul appears to be reﬂecting on a posi-</p>
<p>tive feature of persecution from the world in the life of believers. For many </p>
<p>Christians, back then but also today, this can be counter-intuitive. Isn’t Jesus </p>
<p>supposed to make my life better and easier? </p>
<p>Paul seems to reﬂect a general attitude amongst the earliest Christians </p>
<p>that it is a mark of Jesus and his people that they will be rejected by the </p>
<p>world. According to Luke, Jesus taught that you ought to consider yourself </p>
<p>blessed “when people hate you, and they exclude you, revile you, and defame </p>
<p>you on account of the Son of Man. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for </p>
<p>surely your reward is great in heaven; for that is what their ancestors did to </p>
<p>the prophets” (Luke 6:22–23). In John Jesus says “In this world you will have </p>
<p>trouble” (16:33). According to Romans, Paul explains that being true children </p>
<p>of God is conﬁrmed by sharing in the sufferings of Jesus “in order that we </p>
<p>may also share in his glory” (Rom 8:17). In the book of Acts, we learn that </p>
<p>a band of persecuted apostles, after being beaten and threatened, left the </p>
<p>Sanhedrin with joy because “they were considered worthy to suffer dishonor </p>
<p>for the name” of Jesus (Acts 5:41)—Paul and Barnabas warned the disciples </p>
<p>in Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch about this truth: “It is through many persecu-</p>
<p>tions that we must enter the kingdom of God” (Acts 14:22). </p>
<p>The idea is neither that sufferings earn salvation, nor that God’s desires </p>
<p>to see his people suffer. Rather, we often misunderstand what it means to be </p>
<p>a Christian if we think accepting Jesus gets us “off the hook” of any suffering </p>
<p>or pain. Instead, recognizing Jesus as redeemer and rescuer, we enter into </p>
<p>fellowship with him, and part of what it means to be a united with Jesus is </p>
<p>to enter both into his death as well as his life. Regarding Paul and Barnabas’ </p>
<p>message in Acts 14, Richard Longenecker writes—“They encouraged them </p>
<p>to remain in the faith, telling them that many persecutions must necessarily </p>
<p>(dei) be the lot of Christians in order to enter into the kingdom of God—that is, </p>
<p>that the same pattern of suffering and glory exempliﬁed in Jesus’ life must be </p>
