<p>Fusing the Horizons: War and Peace: e New Covenant Community in Action108</p>
<p>with the model of Jesus, the New Covenant Community should be known for </p>
<p>being peacekeepers, lovers of reconciliation, patient forgivers, and servants </p>
<p>to the wounded, abused, broken, and downtrodden. The image of the slaugh-</p>
<p>tered lamb ought to be a key symbol for the church—absorbing violence, not </p>
<p>perpetuating the cycle.</p>
<p>And yet we must also set that image of the lamb next to the kind of </p>
<p>picture we have here in 1 Thess 5:8–11 of the people of God as warriors. Try </p>
<p>as we may, we cannot take warfare out of the Bible, even the New Testament. </p>
<p>Even though the Gospels do not portray Jesus as a literal warrior, combative </p>
<p>language permeates the New Testament:</p>
<p>• “Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not </p>
<p>come to bring peace, but a sword” (Matt 10:34).</p>
<p>• “And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will </p>
<p>destroy with the breath of his mouth, annihilating him by the manifesta-</p>
<p>tion of his coming” (2 Thess 2:8)</p>
<p>• “From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the </p>
<p>nations and he will rule them with a rod of iron” (Rev 19:15)</p>
<p>Now the point that should be obvious here is that none of this is literal, </p>
<p>physical violence with ﬁsts and swords. Jesus did not really bring a metal </p>
<p>sword. These are word-pictures. However, just because the weapons are not </p>
<p>those of ﬂesh and blood (2 Cor 10:3–6), we should not neglect the reality that </p>
<p>the New Testament writers (and Jesus himself) used combat imagery. If the </p>
<p>ultimate goal is peace, if gentleness and meekness are ideals, then how could </p>
<p>this be? What fellowship can peace have with war? </p>
<p>The point of the warfare language in Paul and the rest of the Bible seems </p>
<p>to relate to an emphasis on the wider battle versus good and evil. Believers </p>
<p>cannot drift through life just spending hours and days waiting to die and go </p>
<p>to heaven. Believers are engaged in a conﬂict against “the rulers, against the </p>
<p>authorities, against the cosmic powers of this present darkness, against the </p>
<p>spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places” (Eph 6:12). Just because the </p>
<p>battle is not waged with tanks and bombs doesn’t make it any less serious or </p>
<p>necessary. According to Paul, the cosmic battle is the important one and it is </p>
<p>a contest in which all believers must partake. Believers are not called to be </p>
<p>physically violent, but they are taught to engage in spiritual battle, knowing </p>
<p>the enemies and knowing the proper equipment to win the war (e.g., loyalty, </p>
<p>hope, and love). </p>
