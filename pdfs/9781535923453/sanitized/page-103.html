<p>The Hopeful Fate of the Christian Dead </p>
<p>(1 Thess 4:13–18) </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>We do not want you to be uninformed, my dear brothers and </p>
<p>sisters, on the matter of those who are “asleep.” We do not want </p>
<p>you to grieve as the rest who have no hope. </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>For if we believe </p>
<p>that Jesus died and rose, so also God will bring those who have </p>
<p>“fallen asleep” thorough Jesus with him. </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>For we say this to you </p>
<p>in a word from the Lord: we who are le alive at the coming of the </p>
<p>Lord will absolutely not go ahead of those who have “fallen asleep.” </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>e Lord himself will descend from heaven with a command, </p>
<p>with the voice of an archangel, and the dead in the Messiah will </p>
<p>rise rst. </p>
<p>17</p>
<p>en we who are le alive, along with them, will be </p>
<p>swept up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And henceforth </p>
<p>we will be with the Lord forever. </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>erefore comfort one another </p>
<p>with these words. </p>
<p>Paul addresses in 4:13–18 a topic that seems to be of particular interest to </p>
<p>the essalonians—that is, the fate of the Christian dead. e fact that he </p>
<p>gives such emphasis to the notion that “we . . . will absolutely not go ahead </p>
<p>of those who have ‘fallen asleep’” (4:15) is probably a clue that there were </p>
<p>some who thought that those who died (recently) were somehow doomed </p>
<p>or separated from the Lord Jesus. Paul is insistent that those dead will be </p>
<p>appropriately reunited with them (the essalonians) and the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p>Why refer to the dead as “asleep”? It could be pointed out that this lan-</p>
<p>guage is somewhat conventional in the Greco-Roman world. Roman poet </p>
<p>Catullus wrote, “e sun can set and rise again / But once our brief light </p>
<p>sets / ere is one unending night to be slept through.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Indeed, historians</p>
<p>and archaeologists have discovered a repeated pattern on ancient Greek </p>
<p>vase-paintings that depict twin-brother gods anatos (Death) and Hypnos </p>
<p>(Sleep) liing or carrying a dead body together.</p>
