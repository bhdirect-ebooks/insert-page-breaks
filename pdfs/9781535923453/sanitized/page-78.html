<p>Paul’s Love, Pride, and Concern </p>
<p>(1 Thess 2:17—3:13)</p>
<p>In 2:1–12, Paul’s concern is that the essalonians have a proper under-</p>
<p>standing of his motives and behavior when he was with them. e points </p>
<p>he made about his own purity of motive, integrity, courage, and aection </p>
<p>for them was not only in service of defending his honor, but also to supply </p>
<p>a righteous example for them. In 2:17—3:10, Paul continues with this con-</p>
<p>cern, but here the focus is on what happened aer Paul le essalonica. </p>
<p>ey were not only beloved to him when he was in their presence, but also </p>
<p>in absence. is section is concluded with a “prayer-wish,” where Paul ex-</p>
<p>presses his concern for their well-being and their maturity before God and </p>
<p>especially in view of the impending return of the Lord Jesus (3:11–13).</p>
<p>Paul’s Longing for the essalonians (2:17–20)</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>But, as for us, my dear brothers and sisters, when we were sepa-</p>
<p>rated from you for a time, in person not in our hearts, we longed </p>
<p>more deeply and with great aection to see you in person. </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>For </p>
<p>we wanted to visit you—I, Paul, tried again and again—but Satan </p>
<p>blocked our way. </p>
<p>19</p>
<p>For who is our hope, our joy, our crown of </p>
<p>boasting before our Lord Jesus when he comes, if not you? </p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Yes, </p>
<p>you are our glory and joy! </p>
<p>According to Acts, Paul and Silas ed from essalonica to Berea to avoid </p>
<p>the hostility and persecution of the agitated essalonian citizens and city </p>
<p>ocials (Acts 17:8–10). Paul may be referring to this same situation when </p>
<p>he mentions being separated from the essalonians for a time (2:17). </p>
<p>e word separated (aporphanizō) bears the kind of image of being torn </p>
<p>away from one’s parents and, thus, to be orphaned (in fact, we get our word </p>
<p>“orphan” from this Greek word).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> Given how much Paul uses kinship lan-</p>
<p>guage in this letter, the idea that Paul thought of the essalonians as family </p>
<p>members ts well into his wider argument that he was just as ill-aected by </p>
<p>1. Note the NRSV: “We were made orphans by being separated from you” (2:17a).</p>
