<p>Perseverance and Hope (2 ess 2:1–17)140</p>
<p>little sense for Paul to comfort the essalonians by describing a scenario </p>
<p>where people undeserving of punishment are punished. Paul is explaining </p>
<p>how these lawless people will surely face judgment (2:12).</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>Appointed for Consecration and Glory (2:13–15)</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Now, as for us, we ought to give thanks to God always when it </p>
<p>comes to you, dear brothers and sisters beloved by the Lord, be-</p>
<p>cause God chose you as rst fruits for salvation in consecration </p>
<p>by the Spirit and by trust in the truth, </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>to which also he called </p>
<p>you through our gospel for the possession of the glory of our Lord </p>
<p>Messiah Jesus. </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>So then, my dear brothers and sisters, stand rm </p>
<p>and hold rmly to the traditions that you were taught whether by </p>
<p>word or a letter from us! </p>
<p>Paul transitions here to the proper response to his teaching on these </p>
<p>eschatological events. First, Paul expresses thanksgiving to God (again, see </p>
<p>2 ess 1:3), because they have chosen the better path of following in the </p>
<p>way of truth, i.e., the gospel. Despite the tribulations and trials they are </p>
<p>facing, their hope should be in the Lord Messiah Jesus and the inevitable </p>
<p>fellowship with his glory. It is easy, when times get tough, to feel as if God </p>
<p>were not with us or not for us—is God punishing me? Did he abandon me? </p>
<p>No doubt the essalonians felt as if perhaps they had landed on the wrong </p>
<p>side somehow and were doomed. </p>
<p>Here Paul oers a number of words of comfort that reinforce the </p>
<p>essalonians identity in God through Jesus, over and against what their </p>
<p>accusers were saying. First, he calls them “beloved by the Lord”—similar to </p>
<p>1 ess 1:4, “loved by God.” Of course it is a comfort to know one is loved </p>
<p>and cherished by the Lord, but the intertextual resonances are important </p>
<p>here—the language of the Lord loving and choosing is classic Deuteronomic </p>
<p>language of the adoption of God’s people, Israel, in the Old Testament: </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>It was not because you were more numerous than any other </p>
<p>people that the LORD set his heart on you and chose you—for you </p>
<p>were the fewest of all peoples. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>It was because the LORD loved you </p>
<p>and kept the oath that he swore to your ancestors, that the LORD </p>
<p>34. Not a few scholars believe that Paul is framing the very persecutors of the es-</p>
<p>salonians as the deceived followers of the Lawless One; see Weima 2014: 540; cf. Gaventa </p>
<p>1998: 115–16.</p>
