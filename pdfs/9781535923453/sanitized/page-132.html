<p>anksgiving and Hope (2 ess 1:1–12)120</p>
<p>anksgiving for Faithful Endurance (1:3–4)</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>We ought to thank God for you all the time, my dear brothers and </p>
<p>sister, as it is a worthy thing to do, because your loyalty is growing </p>
<p>beyond measure and your love is increasing—each and every one </p>
<p>for the other and vice versa. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>erefore we ourselves boast about </p>
<p>you to all the churches of God thanks to your loyal endurance in </p>
<p>the face of all the harassment against you and the troubles you are </p>
<p>enduring. </p>
<p>As is typical in most of his letters, Paul oers thanksgiving to God for the </p>
<p>lives of those to whom he is writing, particularly for their delty and de-</p>
<p>votion. In 2 essalonians, Paul commends their loyalty (pistis) and love </p>
<p>(agapē) that marks communal life, and all this in spite of persecution and </p>
<p>trials. </p>
<p>While 1 essalonians also includes a thanksgiving, in the second let-</p>
<p>ter there is more of an ocial-sounding tone—we ought to...as it is a worthy </p>
<p>thing. . . . It is possible, as F. F. Bruce suggests, that Paul felt the need to </p>
<p>explain why he had such optimism and joy in regards to their perseverance, </p>
<p>even if some of the essalonians had felt his earlier commendation was </p>
<p>exaggerated. In such a case, Paul responded in this second letter that he is </p>
<p>not only led to thanksgiving towards God on their account, but indeed he </p>
<p>sees it as his “bounden duty” to honor God for how he works mighty things </p>
<p>among and for his people.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>e language of doing what is “proper” and “of worth” in thanksgiv-</p>
<p>ing to God also implies that Paul had taken up a more formal liturgical </p>
<p>tone here, one reminiscent of several Jewish texts of his time. For example, </p>
<p>Roger Aus observes how Philo (an Alexandrian Jewish writer) encourages </p>
<p>the sacrice of praise, noting that the Jew who has lived a blessed life “has </p>
<p>as his bounden duty to requite God, who has been the pilot of his voyage . . . </p>
<p>with hymns, and songs, and prayers, and also sacrices, and all other imag-</p>
<p>inable tokens of gratitude in a holy manner; all which things taken together </p>
<p>have received the one comprehensive name of praise” (Spec. Leg. 1.224).</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Aus notes that this liturgical rhetoric of propriety and ttingness </p>
<p>passes on into the early Christian tradition. As an example, one notably </p>
<p>similar to 2 essalonians, Aus refers to the Hermas Similitudes 9 which </p>
<p>includes a discussion of persecution against Christians. An angel shares </p>
<p>3. See Bruce 1982: 144.</p>
