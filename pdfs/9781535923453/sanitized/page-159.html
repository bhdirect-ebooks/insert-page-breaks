<p>Mission and Community (2 ess 3:1–18) 147</p>
<p>Warning Against the Idle Troublemakers and Disobedient </p>
<p>(3:6–12,13–15)</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Now we command you, my dear brothers and sisters, in the name </p>
<p>of our Lord Messiah Jesus, to stay away from any brother who is </p>
<p>behaving as an idle troublemaker and not living according to the </p>
<p>tradition received from us. </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>For you yourselves know how you </p>
<p>should imitate us—we were not idle when we were with you, </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>and </p>
<p>we did not eat anyone’s bread without paying for it; but with toil </p>
<p>and labor we worked night and day, so not to burden any of you. </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>is was not because we do not have that right, but we did this to </p>
<p>oer ourselves as an example to imitate. </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>For even when we were </p>
<p>with you, we gave you this command: Anyone unwilling to work </p>
<p>should not eat. </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>For we hear that some of you are living in idle-</p>
<p>ness, mere busybodies, not doing any work. </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Now such persons </p>
<p>we command and exhort in the Lord Messiah Jesus to do their </p>
<p>own work quietly and to earn their own living.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>My dear brothers and sisters, do not let it wear you out to </p>
<p>do what is right. </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Take note of those who do not obey what we </p>
<p>say in this letter; have nothing to do with them, so that they may </p>
<p>be ashamed. </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Do not regard them as enemies, but warn them as </p>
<p>brothers and sisters. </p>
<p>Paul’s warm word of encouragement turns to a stern warning regard-</p>
<p>ing a meddlesome group within the church. e whole section of 3:6–12 </p>
<p>describes these troublemakers and establishes them as deviants who have </p>
<p>strayed from proper apostolic teaching regarding work, integrity, and </p>
<p>proper communal life. e keywords Paul uses here to describe these devi-</p>
<p>ants are atakōs (adverb, “in an idle/unruly way”; 3:6, 11) and atakteō (verb, </p>
<p>“to be idle/unruly,” 3:7). In 1 ess 5:14, Paul made passing reference to </p>
<p>the “idle” (noun, ataktos), but in that letter he instructed the essalonians </p>
<p>only to admonish them. e fact of such a lengthy warning about these </p>
<p>people implies that they have become a more serious problem.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A fundamental interpretive issue involves the meaning itself of this </p>
<p>word-group in this particular socio-historical context. e root takt* </p>
<p>means “order”; when you add the a-prex, it means “disorder.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> In the his-</p>
<p>tory of the use of this word in Greek literature before and around the time </p>
<p>8. Skeen 1999: 288–90.</p>
<p>9. For example, in the Septuagint (Greek) translation of Prov 30:27, we read: “e </p>
<p>locusts have no kind, and yet march in good order at one command.” “In good order” </p>
<p>translates the Greek adverb eutaktōs (the prex “eu” means “good”). </p>
