<p>Exhortation to Persevere and Grow in Holiness, Love, and Integrity 81</p>
<p>Conviv. 2.10). us, on this reading, Paul would be adapting conventional </p>
<p>language. He would be urging believing men in the essalonian church to </p>
<p>“restrict their sexual activity to their own wives and to enter on this with </p>
<p>them in sanctication and honour.”</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A second option is to see skeuos in reference to the person’s own body </p>
<p>(see NRSV; NET).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>So, Paul writes in 2 Cor 4:7, “We have this treasure</p>
<p>in earthen vessels (skeuos), that the surpassing power belongs to God and </p>
<p>not to us” (NASB). is view comports well with the idea that the body is </p>
<p>sacred and not meant for sexual immorality, so what we do with our bodies </p>
<p>matters greatly to God (1 Cor 6:13, 18; 9:27; 2 Cor 12:21; Rom 6:19). e </p>
<p>greatest challenge with this view involves the verb ktaomai. If the primary </p>
<p>meaning of this verb is “to acquire,” what would it mean for Paul to urge the </p>
<p>essalonians to “acquire” their own bodies? It is possible that one heard </p>
<p>excuses for promiscuity like “I couldn’t help myself.” Paul would, then, be </p>
<p>responding, “Get ahold of yourself!” us, G. K. Beale, for example, looks </p>
<p>at the use of ktaomai in this way: “those not presently living holy lives must </p>
<p>begin to do so, that is, take possession of their bodies and begin to control </p>
<p>them and then continue to do so.”</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>A third option (perhaps viewed as a more specic subset under option </p>
<p>two) would be to see skeuos as a euphemism for the male genitalia. Gordon </p>
<p>Fee has made a reasonable case that the desire to use a euphemism may be </p>
<p>the reason behind Paul talking about “vessel” versus simply using the literal </p>
<p>words for “wife” (option one) or “body” (option two).</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Of these options, I lean in favor of the second, that Paul refers to con-</p>
<p>trol over the body.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Paul saw the problem of sin as a battle for control: “do</p>
<p>not let sin reign in your mortal bodies, to make you obey their passions” </p>
<p>11. Best 1986: 162–63. Some interpreters in the past who have defended this view </p>
<p>made appeal to 1 Peter 3:7 where skeuos is used in reference to the wife, but this so-called </p>
<p>parallel has been largely debunked because the text implies that both the husband and </p>
<p>the wife are vessels; see Smith 2001: 65–105.</p>
<p>12. While it is not commonplace for the word “vessel” (skeuos) to be used metaphori-</p>
<p>cally to mean “wife,” it is more frequently used in reference to the body in Jewish litera-</p>
<p>ture; see, e.g., Apocalypse of Sedrach 11.2, 6; Testament of Naphtali 2.2.</p>
<p>13. Beale 2003: 117.</p>
<p>14. See Fee 2009: 149; also further possible evidence from Elgvin 1997: 604–19.</p>
<p>15. How should translations approach this matter? Beverly Gaventa wonders wheth-</p>
<p>er it is best to render it literally as “vessel.” She explains: “It is important to see . . . that </p>
<p>one reason this debate has emerged is precisely that Paul himself gives us few clues as to </p>
<p>what he means by the use of the word skeuos. He writes in terse aphorisms that call out </p>
<p>for explanation. Presumably this is because he has already instructed the essalonians, </p>
<p>and they know what he means, even if we do not” (1998: 53).</p>
