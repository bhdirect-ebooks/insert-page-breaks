<p>Excursus: Whose Peace and Security? 105</p>
<p>Joel White has written an insightful article acknowledging that, indeed the </p>
<p>language of peace and safety does crop up in imperial texts and on inscrip-</p>
<p>tions and coins, but there is little evidence for a distinct “slogan” and the </p>
<p>terms eir</p>
<p>ē</p>
<p>n</p>
<p>ē</p>
<p>(peace) and asphaleia (security/safety) are extremely common</p>
<p>and can be found in relation to a number of contexts political, religious, and </p>
<p>otherwise.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>It is my contention that the Thessalonian believers may have been falsely </p>
<p>comforted by the “predictions” of local Jewish prophets who promised protec-</p>
<p>tion from future tragedies and deaths on the condition that they appease </p>
<p>the God from whom they have turned away, assuming they were Gentile god-</p>
<p>fearers who had taken an interest in the Jewish synagogue.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>This hypothesis,</p>
<p>then, would lean in favor of the older reading of 5:3 which detected an allu-</p>
<p>sion to texts like Ezek 13:10, issuing warning of the deceptive safety offered </p>
<p>by counterfeit prophets.</p>
<p>You are Day—and Light—People (5:4–7)</p>
<p>From a more temporal discussion of what is to come (the surreptitious ap-</p>
<p>pearance of the Lord like a night-thief), Paul transitions to an ethical state-</p>
<p>ment about two kinds of people: those associated with night/dark(ness) </p>
<p>and those associated with day/light. What we nd here is classic dualis-</p>
<p>tic imagery.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Going all the way back to the early chapters of Genesis we</p>
<p>nd reference to light and darkness, night and day. And throughout the </p>
<p>Old Testament night and darkness are symbolically related to hiddenness </p>
<p>(Job 12:22; 29:3), ignorance, evil (Ps 139:11–12), sin (Isa 5:20), and judg-</p>
<p>ment (Amos 5:18). And, of course, conversely, light is related to revelation </p>
<p>(Dan 2:22), wisdom (Ecc 2:13), and salvation (Ps 18:28). As we move into </p>
<p>the second temple period of Judaism, we see a more consistently agonis-</p>
<p>tic and apocalyptic use of light imagery. People and groups are regularly </p>
