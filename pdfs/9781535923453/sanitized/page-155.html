<p>Perseverance and Hope (2 ess 2:1–17) 143</p>
<p>Wish-Prayer for Strength and Comfort (2:16–17)</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Now, then, as for our Lord Messiah Jesus himself and God our </p>
<p>Father who has loved us and given to us eternal comfort and good </p>
<p>hope by grace, </p>
<p>17</p>
<p>may they comfort your hearts and strengthen </p>
<p>you in every work and word. </p>
<p>Paul’s concluding statement in this section is a wish prayer that gives </p>
<p>attention to their situation (comfort and strength), but also to the gracious </p>
<p>pair—the Lord Messiah Jesus and God the Father—who continue to care </p>
<p>for the essalonians. At the same time Paul prays for the comfort of God, </p>
but also desires divine empowerment to lead the essalonians onward in
<p>goodness.</p>
<p>Fusing Horizons: Living beyond Fear</p>
<p>So much of this chapter of 2 Thessalonians involves Paul’s very speciﬁc re-</p>
<p>sponses to concerns and confusion in Thessalonica. At ﬁrst glance, then, it </p>
<p>may seem like there is little here to teach the Church today. However, the </p>
<p>central problem amongst the Thessalonians was that they were paralyzed with </p>
<p>fear about what is yet to come. The speciﬁcs change in every generation, </p>
<p>but many Christians today are also worried about the future. Global warming. </p>
<p>Potential nuclear war. Depleting energy sources. Increasingly scarce clean </p>
<p>water. Paul does not preach the hope of an easy future—in some ways things </p>
<p>will get worse before they get better; but he still encourages believers to put </p>
<p>their hope in God and trust that God will lead his people towards a good end. </p>
<p>And—just as with Paul’s expectations for the Thessalonians—hoping does not </p>
<p>mean sitting on one’s hands and waiting for the predetermined future events </p>
<p>to unfold. Rather, Christian hope walks into that future and remains faithful in </p>
<p>what God gives us today as long as it is called today. </p>
