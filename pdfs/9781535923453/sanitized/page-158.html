<p>Mission and Community (2 ess 3:1–18)146</p>
<p>is dicult to pinpoint exactly what Paul means when he uses pistis in this </p>
<p>independent, unqualied way in 2 ess 3:2, but it appears to mean some-</p>
<p>thing like thought and life transformed around and committed in loyalty to </p>
<p>the gospel of Messiah Jesus. Pistis is a load-bearing word for Paul, central </p>
<p>to his understanding of the gospel, multi-faceted, and, thus his use of the </p>
<p>word tends to imply more than one simple thing like “faith” or “belief.” </p>
<p>When Paul reminds the essalonians, then, that “loyalty” is not a </p>
<p>characteristic of everyone, he does not mean “loyalty” generically, but that </p>
<p>idea of thought and life transformed around and committed in loyalty to </p>
<p>the gospel of Messiah Jesus. It is my working theory that those who were </p>
<p>troubling the essalonian believers were claiming to understand God and </p>
<p>what God wants, and were attempting to move the essalonian church </p>
<p>away from the true gospel. Paul was making a link between his own op-</p>
<p>ponents in Corinth (wicked and evil people) and those in essalonica, </p>
<p>reminding his converts to beware of those who seem to know what is right, </p>
<p>but actually do not have pistis (loyalty) in Jesus.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>In 3:3–5, Paul shows his pastoral concern for the essalonians clearly </p>
<p>by reminding them, despite the bleakness of shame and resistance coming </p>
<p>from people around them, the Lord is faithful, and they are in his care. Paul </p>
<p>is eusive with the encouragement that they are obedient to the truth of </p>
<p>gospel taught by him, and they will continue in that obedience (3:4). </p>
<p>Paul follows this encouragement with a “wish-prayer” that the Lord </p>
<p>might direct their hearts towards the love of God and perseverance of the </p>
<p>Messiah (3:5). Does Paul mean love for God and perseverance in view of the </p>
<p>Messiah’s return? Or, does Paul mean God’s love for them and the persever-</p>
<p>ance shown by the Messiah?</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Perhaps this is one of those cases where Paul</p>
<p>intended some ambiguity with a meaning like this: May the Lord direct </p>
<p>your hearts towards the love God has shown and the perseverance Messiah </p>
<p>Jesus has demonstrated so that you can imitate them.</p>

<p>5. While Weima does not get into the kind of details I have described, and perhaps </p>
<p>would not agree with my reading in its entirety, he does understand this verse along </p>
<p>similar lines: “since there are many who do not have faith, such ‘evil and wicked people’ </p>
(and ‘the evil one’ who is working through these individuals) pose a threat not just to
<p>Paul but also to his converts in essalonica . . .”; see Weima 2014: 590.</p>
<p>6. In view of the grammatical construction of these phrases in Greek, scholars refer </p>
<p>to the former as the “objective genitive” reading and the latter as the “subjective genitive” </p>
<p>reading; either interpretation is possible from the standpoint of Greek syntax, so the </p>
<p>decision involves which option makes the most sense when it comes to the point(s) Paul </p>
<p>is making; see Weima 2014: 598–99.</p>
