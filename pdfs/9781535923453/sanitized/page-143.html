<p>Perseverance and Hope (2 ess 2:1–17) 131</p>
<p>explicitly stated in 2:15: “stand rm and hold rmly to the traditions you </p>
<p>were taught.” Stay the course. </p>
<p>Encouraging Perseverance (2:1–2)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Now, we ask you, my dear brothers and sisters, with regard to the </p>
<p>coming of our Lord Messiah Jesus and our gathering together with </p>
<p>him, </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>that your mind not be easily unsettled or alarmed, whether </p>
<p>it be through a spirit, an audible message, or through a letter (as </p>
<p>if written by us), leading you to believe that the Day of the Lord </p>
<p>has come. </p>
<p>In this introduction to the main topic at hand, Paul refers to the coming of </p>
<p>the Lord Jesus and also “our gathering together with him” (2:1). As Howard </p>
<p>Marshall explains, “this motif goes back to the Jewish hope of the gathering </p>
<p>together of the scattered exiles in their own land and was taken over by </p>
<p>Jesus and the early church to refer to the gathering together of his people </p>
<p>with the Messiah.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Paul had already reminded the essalonians of this</p>
<p>end-time ingathering in his earlier letter (1 ess 4:17), but for some reason </p>
<p>their hope in this had become unsettled. e language Paul uses of being </p>
<p>“stirred up,” as Ernest Best notes, “suggests the sudden onslaught of a storm </p>
<p>that is quickly past but leaves its eects on insecure buildings.”</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But what was the issue, why were they thrown into panic and alarm? </p>
<p>Verse 2:2 implies that something or someone led them to believe that the </p>
<p>“Day of the Lord” had already come. e Day of the Lord was mentioned </p>
<p>in 1 ess 5:2 and goes back to the Old Testament’s reference to a “day of </p>
<p>Yahweh” (e.g., Amos 5:18, 20) that would involve, as Dale Allison notes, </p>
<p>“a dramatic intervention of God in history, a judgment that will condemn </p>
<p>God’s enemies and save God’s people.”</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Paul clearly associated this Day of</p>
<p>Reckoning with Jesus, even sometimes referring to it as the “Day of the </p>
<p>Messiah” (Phil 1:10; 2:16).</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> But what would it have meant for the es-</p>
<p>salonians to have believed this day had already come? </p>

<p>3. Best 1986: 275; cf. Marshall: “being so perturbed as to lose one’s normal compo-</p>
<p>sure and good sense” (1984: 186).</p>

<p>5. Interestingly, some Greek manuscripts have the wording “Day of the Messiah” </p>
<p>instead of “Day of the Lord” in 2 ess 2:2; see Shogren 2012: 274.</p>
