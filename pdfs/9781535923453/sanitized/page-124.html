<p>Final Instruction (1 ess 5:12–28)112</p>
<p>here he aims to underscore the diligence, endurance, and reliability of these </p>
<p>leaders. It is possible that some people in the church resented the corrective </p>
<p>teaching of the leaders (hence Paul’s mention that they “admonish” them), </p>
<p>but since his focus is on acknowledgment and not obedience, the focus for </p>
<p>Paul seems to be on the leaders serving as role models.</p>
<p>Let’s say that the community was thrown into a bit of tumult and </p>
<p>uncertainty due to the recent and sudden death of some of their own, as </p>
<p>well as other issues related to the circumstances of their death. roughout </p>
<p>the whole letter, Paul has emphasized endurance and faithfulness, staying </p>
<p>on course, and ongoing commitment to holiness and obedience to the will </p>
<p>of God. Paul may be setting up hard-working leaders as models of these </p>
<p>virtues for others who had decreased their steady walk of faith down to a </p>
<p>snail’s pace or nearly a halt.</p>
<p>When tragedy strikes a community, when it feels pressure and is </p>
<p>forced through change, there is a natural, even instinctual focus on self-</p>
preservation. All too oen a church can be divided and smaller constituen-cies or individuals lash out against one another, trying to salvage their piece
<p>of stability. </p>
<p>Paul preaches here peace (eirēnē). Regardless of the status of the com-</p>
<p>munity, Paul holds tenaciously to an ethic of other-regard (non-retaliation, </p>
<p>patience, seeking good for all; 5:15). In 5:14 Paul specically mentions the </p>
<p>“faint-hearted” (oligopsychos) and the “weak” (asthenēs). It is dicult to </p>
<p>know who these people are. If the community faced a local tragedy (which </p>
<p>led to deaths in their church), it is possible the “fainthearted” were scared </p>
<p>and fearful of their safety.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>ey needed consolation. As for the “weak,” the</p>
<p>Greek word (asthenēs) is quite broad in meaning and could refer to a weak-</p>
<p>ness of conscience or spirit, or perhaps to those who are physically weak. It </p>
<p>is almost impossible to know without more information about the situation, </p>
<p>but it could be that some believers were physically injured in the event that </p>
<p>led to the deaths in their community. No doubt such ones would need at-</p>
<p>tention and care.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>And what about the “rebellious idle?” Some translations</p>
<p>have opted to read this as people who were “lazy,” but at least since John </p>
<p>Chrysostom many interpreters understand them as “unruly” or “insubor-</p>
<p>dinate.” Malherbe surmises that Paul is calling out these insubordinates for </p>
<p>3. For more information regarding how this situational hypothesis might look, see </p>
<p>14–15.</p>
<p>4. For a discussion of the term asthenēs (“weak”) in its context here, see Black 1984: </p>
<p>22–53.</p>
