<p>upbuilding, unity, and peace. Each one must hear the call to holiness and </p>
<p>maturity.</p>
<p>Finally, as in all his subsequent extant letters, Paul extends his word of </p>
<p>grace from Messiah Jesus.</p>

<p>is oers a nice book-end close to his opening</p>
<p>wish for grace (1:2)</p>

<p>favor and goodness upon them. </p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: The New Covenant Community, A People of </p>
<p>Prayer</p>
<p>Most Christians set aside time for prayer, and rightly so, but Paul refers here </p>
<p>to praying with no beginning or end (1 Thess 5:17). How is this possible? </p>
<p>Paul is not talking about never leaving one’s prayer closet physically, but he is </p>
<p>referring to a prayerful disposition where the believer always lives within the </p>
<p>presence of God. We cannot separate our lives physically into sacred spheres </p>
<p>(church) and secular spheres (ofﬁce). God is everywhere and this is his world. </p>
<p>We cannot simply segment our lives into spiritual times (prayer, devotional </p>
<p>reading, ministry) and other times (work, leisure, chores). The eternal God is </p>
<p>king from dawn to dusk and beyond.</p>
<p>In the context of this letter, Paul tells the Thessalonians to be always-</p>
<p>pray-ers so that they recognize the presence and goodness of God at all times </p>
<p>and especially in difﬁcult circumstances. “Prayer,” then, becomes a term as-</p>
<p>sociated with a believing will that trusts God’s benevolence and promises. To </p>
<p>be an always-pray-er is to be constantly attentive to the work of God around us.</p>
<p>To “pray without ceasing” does not mean a life of prayer-words and </p>
<p>no action. Part of this prayer-ﬁlled disposition is the fostering of a kind of </p>
<p>spiritual instinct that acts on behalf of God’s will. May the people of God, a </p>
<p>people of prayer, be known for both their patient intercession and thanksgiving </p>
<p>towards God, and also their gracious will and actions as agents of Messiah </p>
<p>Jesus’ redemption in the world.</p>
