<p>Mission and Community (2 ess 3:1–18)150</p>
<p>rejected Paul’s teaching (especially about work). ey are reminded of the </p>
<p>value of imitating Paul, and especially his own habit of working to sup-</p>
<p>port his own needs specically to avoid becoming a burden on any of them </p>
<p>(3:7–9; cf. 1 ess 2:9).</p>
<p>Interestingly, Paul then reminds them that he had taught them speci-</p>
<p>cally that “Anyone unwilling to work should not eat” (3:10). Here, again, we </p>
<p>ought to be reminded what Paul is not saying. As Judy Skeen aptly notes, </p>
<p>Paul claries here that the issue is not capability to work but desire </p>
<p>to do one’s part. Paul does not mean that the community should </p>
<p>not care for those who are not able to provide for themselves </p>
<p>physically. Rather, he is warning against the rebellious attitude that </p>
<p>holds oneself higher than those around one. e signicance of </p>
the individual’s actions and choices on the community is coming
<p>into view.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Perhaps the best contextual clue for what motivated this non-working </p>
<p>comes in 2 ess 3:10, some were behaving as busybodies (periergazomai). </p>
<p>Here Paul does not explain what it means to be a busybody, but we can </p>
<p>appeal to 1 Tim 5:13, the only other New Testament text where we nd </p>
<p>this word: “they learn to be idle, gadding about from house to house; and </p>
<p>they are not merely idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying what they </p>
<p>should not say.” </p>
<p>Because Paul’s language for “working” (ergazomai) is so similar to “be-</p>
<p>ing busybodies” (periergazomai), Gaventa oers this gloss: “ey do not do </p>
<p>their own work, but they busy themselves with the work of other people.”</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Such people lack integrity and care little for the strength and wholeness of </p>
<p>the community. Centuries ago, Ambrosiaster oered this reection on the </p>
<p>vice of these busybodies.</p>
<p>ose who want to be idle do this as oen as they can and thereby </p>
<p>make themselves welcome in the houses of the rich. ey go about </p>
<p>quietly collecting stories and opinions, knowing who wants to hear </p>
<p>what about whom, so that they will be freely invited to dinner. e </p>
<p>discipline of the Lord abhors that kind of thing. eir belly is the </p>
<p>god of those who get what they need by disreputable means.</p>
