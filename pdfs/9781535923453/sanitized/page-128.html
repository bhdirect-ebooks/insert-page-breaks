<p>facets or aspects of it, without implying that this facet or aspect </p>
<p>could be split o from all the others.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, then, what do these terms mean? “Body,” Wright argues, relates </p>
<p>to the person’s “public, visible and tangible physical presence in, and in </p>
<p>relation to, the world.”</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>“Soul” refers to the “human seen in terms of the</p>
<p>ordinary human life with its consciousness, self-awareness, memory and </p>
<p>imagination.”</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>And, as for “spirit,” this is “the human seen in terms of an</p>
<p>interiority which is open to the presence and power of the creator (not least </p>
<p>by his [Holy Spirit]).”</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Paul can use a wide range of anthropological terms</p>
<p>to highlight these various angles and perspectives precisely because the </p>
work of divine redemption and sanctication is multi-faceted and each one
<p>(body, soul, and spirit) can be “rescued, redeemed, and redirected.”</p>

<p>Last Words (5:25–28)</p>
<p>At the close of the letter, Paul requests three things from the essalonians. </p>
<p>First, he asks for prayer for himself and his co-workers. For what in particu-</p>
<p>lar were they supposed to pray? Obviously Paul is not specic, but perhaps </p>
<p>he assumes that they will pray for his work of sharing the good news and </p>
<p>forming communities of Jesus-believers amongst the Gentiles.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>It should</p>
<p>not go unnoticed that, at the end of his letter—a place where what he has </p>
<p>written will be most easily remembered—he shows the humility and vul-</p>
<p>nerability to ask for prayer. Not only does it speak to his trust in God as </p>
<p>ruler over all, but it also shows how much he relied on the prayer ministry </p>
<p>of churches to sustain his apostolic work.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Next, Paul tells the essalonians to greet and exchange a holy kiss. </p>
<p>Obviously in the modern Western church this Pauline request comes across </p>

<p>18. Note the much longer explanation in 2 essalonians: “Finally, brothers and </p>
<p>sisters, pray for us, so that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be gloried </p>
<p>everywhere, just as it is among you” (2 ess 3:1); cf. Col 4:3: “At the same time pray for </p>
<p>us as well that God will open to us a door for the word, that we may declare the mystery </p>
<p>of Christ, for which I am in prison, so that I may reveal it clearly, as I should” (Col 4:3–4).</p>

<p>his letters, see the important study Weima 1994.</p>
