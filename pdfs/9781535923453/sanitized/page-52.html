<p>sake. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>And, as for you, you became people who imitated us and </p>
<p>the Lord when, in the midst of great aiction, you accepted the </p>
<p>message with the joy of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>So then you became a </p>
<p>model for all those who believe in Macedonia and Achaia. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>e </p>
<p>message of the Lord trumpeted forth from you, echoing not only </p>
<p>throughout Macedonia and Achaia, but your loyalty towards God </p>
<p>went out into every place, even to the extent that we didn’t need </p>
<p>to tell anyone. </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>For they themselves report about us the kind of </p>
<p>welcome we had with you, and how you turned towards God, re-</p>
<p>jecting idols in order to serve a new master, the living and true </p>
<p>God. </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>And you wait eagerly for his Son to come from heaven, the </p>
<p>one whom God raised from the realm of the dead, Jesus who will </p>
<p>rescue us from God’s coming anger for justice. </p>
<p>As far as we can tell from the Pauline letters in the New Testament </p>
<p>collection, his opening greeting was typically followed by a word of thanks-</p>
<p>giving (Galatians being the obvious exception). He was moved to prayer </p>
<p>and thanks to God because of something special about God’s work in and </p>
<p>through his people (here the essalonians’ exemplary reception of, and </p>
<p>reaction to, the good news of Messiah Jesus). Of special note, in 1 ess 1:2, </p>
<p>is the constancy and passion of Paul’s prayer-life (see also 5:17). e catalyst </p>
<p>for his thanksgiving-prayer here was his memories. For Paul, remembering </p>
<p>was a kind of spiritual discipline (Rom 1:9). Looking to God’s work among </p>
<p>his people (and both God’s faithfulness and theirs) was critical for survival </p>
<p>in a world full of uncertainties and pressures. e same word that Paul uses </p>
<p>for memory in 1:2 is found in the Septuagint in Deut 7:18. ere Moses </p>
<p>enjoined the Israelites, at a time when they were afraid to step out in cov-</p>
<p>enantal trust into an unknown future, to remember God’s power over and </p>
<p>against Egypt when he led them out. Israel was regularly called to establish </p>
<p>a memorial whenever they saw God’s faithful work (see, e.g., Joshua 4:7).</p>
<p>e essalonians are enjoined to remember their own record of </p>
<p>trust. Paul introduces here his familiar triad of trust, hope, and love (see </p>
<p>1 ess 5:8; cf. 1 Cor 13:13). Traditionally, pistis is translated “faith” in the </p>
<p>New Testament, but here it takes on the more common Hellenistic meaning </p>
<p>of “loyalty” or “trust.”</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Paul is not really commending them for what they</p>
<p>believe per se, but rather for their rm commitment to God from the start.</p>

<p>5. So deSilva 1996: 73: “‘faith’ in that context clearly refers to the believers’ persever-</p>
<p>ance in their commitment to the new social reality called the [church of God] in the face </p>
