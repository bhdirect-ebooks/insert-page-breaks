<p>Paul’s Love, Pride, and Concern (1 ess 2:17—3:13) 70</p>
<p>Messiah’s kingdom operates in direct opposition to the sinful way of the </p>
<p>world—his subjects must maintain a distinctly counter-cultural existence </p>
<p>imitating the radically backwards values of holiness as well as self-giving </p>
<p>love towards neighbor and God.</p>
<p>Paul oered this reminder about the inevitability of Christian suer-</p>
<p>ing because he feared that, in his absence, their faith and loyalty would be </p>
<p>shaken (3:3). According to J. P. Louw and Eugene Nida, the verb that Paul </p>
<p>uses here for “shaken,” sainomai, can be dened as “to be so emotionally </p>
<p>disturbed as to give up one’s belief.”</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> e pressures and pushback the es-</p>
<p>salonians were receiving from their neighbors created cognitive and social </p>
<p>pressure that, if not dealt with, could lead to a kind of world-view collapse </p>
<p>(see Introduction, 2–3).</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>One way that Paul could manage to avoid this</p>
<p>implosion was to warn and prepare believers. However, when push comes </p>
<p>to shove (perhaps literally in this case), training can fail. How many sol-</p>
<p>diers, having theoretically “trained for war,” have retreated when things get </p>
<p>overwhelming on the real battleeld? </p>
<p>Paul was afraid that the Tempter may have succeeded in undermin-</p>
<p>ing their condence and hope (3:5b). Clearly the “Tempter” is Satan who </p>
<p>makes it a habit of preying on the weak (1 Cor 7:5). But the New Testament </p>
<p>is quite emphatic that, while the Tempter sees it as his business to tempt, </p>
<p>he has no power to control the human will.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>His role is to distract and</p>
<p>confuse, and to promote fear and doubt. One wonders whether the situa-</p>
<p>tion of the essalonians might have been similar to that of the Smyrnian </p>
<p>church (of a later time): “Do not fear what you are about to suer. Beware, </p>
<p>the devil is about to throw some of you in prison so that you may be tested, </p>
<p>and for ten days you will have aiction. Be faithful until death, and I will </p>
<p>give you the crown of life” (Rev 2:10). As we learn here, the Evil One tests </p>
<p>(or tempts) to push people to their breaking point. Revelation encourages </p>
<p>the Smyrnians to endure even if it means martyrdom. We do not know </p>
<p>what the essalonians were facing, but Paul oered critical advice—keep </p>
<p>pressing on. e subtext of 1 ess 3:3–4 is that Paul could forewarn and </p>
<p>prepare the essalonians about suering and trials precisely because God </p>
<p>has all things in hand and such set-backs and challenges cannot thwart his </p>
<p>13. L-N 31.66.</p>
<p>14. See also Gaventa 1998: 42.</p>
<p>15. St. omas Aquinas reinforces this point: “To tempt is properly speaking to make </p>
<p>trial of something. . . . A demon cannot change the will. . . . [is] cannot be forced; it </p>
<p>can be inclined.” See Summa eologiae 1, qu. 114, art. 2, as cited in iselton 2011: 87.</p>
