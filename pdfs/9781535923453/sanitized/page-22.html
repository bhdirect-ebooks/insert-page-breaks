<p>Persecution and Pistis</p>
<p>e rst thing that is clear in Paul’s letter is that the essalonians expe-</p>
<p>rienced persecution from the beginning (1:6; 2:14). is would not have </p>
<p>been a state-enforced persecution, but rather harassment from commu-</p>
<p>nity members who were troubled by their newfound religion and practices </p>
<p>(again, note the scenario in essalonica in Acts 17:1–10a). essalonian </p>
<p>believers in Jesus would have been taught by Paul to devote themselves </p>
<p>exclusively to the one God, thus they would have withdrawn from local pa-</p>
<p>gan rites, festivities that typically had important political dimensions. ey </p>
<p>would have been charged with “atheism”; as Philip Esler explains, “To be </p>
<p>respectable and decent meant taking part in the [local, religious] cult; old </p>
<p>was good and new was bad; us, religion served to strengthen the existing </p>
<p>social order. To deny the reality of the gods was absolutely unacceptable—</p>
<p>one would be ostracized for that, even stoned in the streets.”</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With this kind of context in mind, most scholars presume that the </p>
<p>persecutors were Gentiles, not Jews. Such a view, though, would discount </p>
<p>Luke’s information in Acts 17 where it would seem Jews played a major role </p>
<p>in the hostility against Paul’s ministry and local allies. Again, the scholarly </p>
<p>tendency is to put doubt on Luke’s account for two reasons. Firstly, some </p>
<p>argue that Luke has certain theological and narrative habits that shape how </p>
<p>he presents Paul’s ministry, in this case leading to doubts regarding the </p>
<p>historicity of his version of the situation in essalonica. Secondly, such </p>
<p>a view seems to contradict what Paul writes in 1 ess 2:14, that the es-</p>
<p>salonian believers “suered the same things from your own compatriots as </p>
<p>they [the Judean churches] did from the Jews.” e implication here seems </p>
<p>to be that the essalonians were persecuted by Gentile essalonians while </p>
<p>the Judean believers were persecuted by Jewish neighbors. However, the </p>
<p>meaning of the word for compatriots here (symphyletēs) is contested.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Again, many scholars assume that Paul is referring to Gentile essalonian </p>
<p>“compatriots,”</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>but when Paul proclaims that the Jews “drove us out” (1</p>
<p>ess 2:15), why could not the same Jews that drove Paul out of essa-</p>
<p>lonica also persecute the essalonians believers?</p>

<p>explains that, while symphyletēs once carried the meaning of blood relation (i.e., ethnic </p>
<p>association), it eventually expanded in meaning to cover administrative, military, and </p>
