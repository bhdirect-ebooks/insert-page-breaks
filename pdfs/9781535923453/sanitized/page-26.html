<p>Sexual Purity</p>
<p>A second matter that Paul addresses in the letter relates to sexual purity. </p>
<p>Paul calls for control over the body, lest they succumb to heathen lust </p>
<p>(4:3–4). e Greco-Roman lifestyle was highly permissive when it came </p>
<p>to male sexuality. Men oen had sex with multiple people, though it was </p>
<p>considered especially inappropriate to commit adultery by sleeping with </p>
<p>another man’s wife. Paul called for a strict kind of holiness and purity that </p>
<p>sought to honor one another and God (4:6).</p>
<p>e Dead in the Messiah</p>
<p>A third problem in essalonica apparently pertained to the death of some </p>
<p>members of the church (4:13–18). Paul felt the need to comfort them by </p>
<p>urging that the recently-deceased believers would be especially honored at </p>
<p>the return of the Lord. Many scholars believe that the essalonians naively </p>
<p>thought that everyone would remain alive until the return of the Messiah, </p>
<p>so the death of church members was perplexing and even traumatizing. </p>
<p>is is possible, but it does not account for the unusual emphasis Paul plac-</p>
<p>es on the dead in the Messiah being lied up rst, before the living at the </p>
<p>return of the Messiah (4:15). Why would they receive this honor of prior-</p>
<p>ity? A minority of scholars (including myself) hypothesize that those who </p>
<p>died may have been martyred, killed by persecutors.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>is view accords</p>
<p>well with how it could be possible that several people died in the same </p>
<p>small believing community around the same time a short while aer Paul </p>
<p>le. Furthermore, it explains why Paul focuses on their position of honor—</p>
<p>those who died for their allegiance to Messiah deserve such a special role.</p>
<p>Excursus: Hypothesizing a Clandestine Attack</p>
<p>One scenario that could bring several issues together in 1 Thessalonians is </p>
<p>the consideration that the opponents of the believing Thessalonians planned </p>
<p>some kind of clandestine attack. Let’s say certain upset Jews, (former) friends </p>
<p>of these god-fearers-turned-Jesus-followers, secretly attacked their workshop </p>
<p>or apartment building. Let’s say they set it on ﬁre at night. This could explain </p>
<p>45. See Pobee 1985: 114; Donfried 1997: 221–23; Witherington 2006: 139; L. T. John-</p>
<p>son 1999: 285, Donfried and Marshall 1993: 28, and Gorman 2004: 150 are open to this </p>
<p>possibility as well; see also Gorman 2015.</p>
