<p>Paul’s Love, Pride, and Concern (1 ess 2:17—3:13) 68</p>
<p>based on the fruitfulness of his ministry (see Rom 15:16). He can claim a </p>
<p>“hope” and “crown of boasting” based on churches such as the essalo-</p>
<p>nians’, because his ministry had such an eective impact on them and they </p>
<p>responded appropriately to the good news of Messiah Jesus through the </p>
<p>power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> It may seem strange to us that Paul writes posi-</p>
<p>tively about “boasting.” Certainly he does occasionally condemn inappro-</p>
<p>priate self-centered boasting (for example, see 2 Cor 10:17). But that does </p>
<p>not preclude a noble kind of “pride” that recognizes the work of God in </p>
<p>one’s life and ministry.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Paul mentions to the Philippians that the maturity</p>
<p>of their faith on the “day of the Messiah” will prove that “I [Paul] did not </p>
<p>run in vain or labor in vain” (Phil 2:16). us, he can boast in his converts </p>
<p>as fruit of God’s work through him (see 1 Cor 15:31; 2 Cor 7:4).</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> e es-</p>
<p>salonians are Paul’s own “glory” because he beams with pride on account </p>
<p>of their rm commitment to Messiah Jesus, all of which is a demonstration </p>
<p>of the grace and power of God. N. T. Wright oers an apt reection on how </p>
<p>this attitude can nourish and inspire all believers today.</p>
<p>Each of us has our own work of love to perform, whether it be </p>
<p>quiet and secret or well known and public. Each pastor and </p>
<p>teacher should look to the future, and see those in their charge </p>
<p>as their potential joy, hope, and crown. And each congregation </p>
<p>should recognize that this is how they will appear on the last day. </p>
<p>Both should be challenged and encouraged, by this forward look, </p>
<p>to learn and live the faith, to celebrate the hope, to consolidate and </p>
<p>practise the love revealed in the gospel.</p>

<p>7. Malherbe 2000: 185; Wanamaker 1990: 123. James W. ompson oers an excel-</p>
<p>lent discussion of this subject: “In every instances in which Paul declares his pastoral </p>
<p>ambition, he indicates that the success or failure of his work will be determined only </p>
<p>at the end, when he will either ‘boast’ of his work or realize that his work has been in </p>
<p>vain. e eschatological horizon is a central feature of Paul’s pastoral ambition. . . . [T]he </p>
<p>ultimate test of his ministry is the outcome of his work with the churches, the ultimate </p>
<p>goal denes his ministry in the present.” See 2006: 22; generally 31–60.</p>
<p>8. A text like Gal 6:4 gives the impression that a good sense of pride has its place </p>
<p>where one can be proud of oneself for a job well done, but a line is crossed when the </p>
<p>matter turns into a contest or “us” vs. “them” rally.</p>
<p>9. A helpful place to turn for discussion regarding the relationship between justica-</p>
<p>tion by faith and judgment according to deeds is the recently published Four Views on the </p>
<p>Role of Works at the Final Judgment with Robert N. Wilkin, omas Schreiner, James D. </p>
<p>G. Dunn, and Michael Barber as contributors (ed. A. Stanley, 2013).</p>
