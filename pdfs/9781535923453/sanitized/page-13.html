<p>Introduction</p>
<p>“Everything that is done in the world is done by hope” —Luther</p>
<p>“Hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless” </p>
<p>—G.K.Chesterton</p>
<p>“Faith goes up the stairs that love has built and looks out the win-</p>
<p>dows which hope has opened.” —Charles Spurgeon </p>
<p>Paul’s message to the essalonian church in 1 essalonians can be sum-</p>
<p>marized in one word—“hope.” Hope, for Paul, was not a word represen-</p>
<p>tative of mere longings or wishful thinking. It was, not unlike we see in </p>
<p>Hebrews, something certain, but invisible. Hope was the word Paul used to </p>
<p>talk about the invisible (but real) future promised by the invisible (but real) </p>
<p>God who gave the most certain assurances of the fulllment of his promises </p>
<p>in the death and resurrection of Messiah Jesus as well as the “deposit” of the </p>
<p>Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>e word “hope” only appears a handful of times in these letters (1 </p>
<p>ess 1:3; 2:19; 4:13; 5:8; 2 ess 2:16), but it represents well Paul’s central </p>
<p>emphasis: in the tumult, chaos, confusion, and rough-and-tumble of life, you </p>
<p>must trust God and God’s future by moving forward in faith and faithfulness. </p>
<p>Hope is his word for a targeted faith, anticipatory faith, quite similar to </p>
<p>what we see in Heb 11:13. According to Hebrews, the Old Testament people </p>
<p>of faith did not live in the world of the nal fulllment of God’s promises, </p>
<p>but “saw it all from a distance and welcomed it” (NLT). Another transla-</p>
<p>tion says they “greeted it from afar” (RSV). While they obviously never </p>
<p>reached it, they mapped their journey towards it, as it were, and ran with </p>
<p>outstretched arms. eir job, in their time, was not to get to the destination, </p>
<p>but to live their present life in the light of that hope, to navigate their vessel </p>
<p>(to change the metaphor) according to that beacon.</p>
