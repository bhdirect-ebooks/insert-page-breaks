<p>Final Instruction (1 ess 5:12–28)114</p>
<p>very specic, time-related, event-oriented concern on the essalonians’ </p>
<p>behalf with regard to the will of God (the recent deaths), and he changes the </p>
<p>focus to the overall devotional and covenantal “will” (thelēma) of God “in </p>
Messiah Jesus.” Instead of trying to “divine” the future, they should focus on divine virtues and habits: joy, prayer, thanksgiving. ese three are closely
<p>linked for Paul. A prayerful disposition places God at the center of life and </p>
<p>knowing his sovereignty (i.e., that he reigns over all things) and his pres-</p>
<p>ence (through the Spirit of Jesus) can and should produce joy and inspire </p>
<p>thanksgiving. </p>
<p>is is related to Paul’s concern that, rst, the essalonians not sup-</p>
<p>press the Spirit, and, second, that prophecy is not at-out rejected, but </p>
<p>cautiously considered aer testing. Malherbe considers whether Christian </p>
<p>“prophetic pretenders” appeared and Paul was warning them not to be </p>
<p>enchanted by their prophecies without discernment.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> Some believing es-</p>
<p>salonians may have written o prophecy altogether, but in this case Paul </p>
<p>discourages unilateral rejection. Paul is quick to address too the equally </p>
<p>problematic uncritical acceptance of prophetic knowledge. Prophecies </p>
<p>must be carefully judged. But how did one judge a prophecy such that it </p>
<p>could be determined to be good and true? Unfortunately Paul does not </p>
<p>tell us! I think, though, Ben Witherington makes a strong case for seeing </p>
<p>acceptable prophecy as the kind that builds up, encourages, and comforts.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One should keep in mind that Paul had just placed the focus on joy and </p>
<p>thanksgiving in this section, and then transitions to a wish-prayer to the </p>
<p>God of peace in the next section. Good and true prophetic words should </p>
<p>not have the ultimate eect of stirring up fear and anxiety, but should lead </p>
<p>the recipients (even sometimes through a healthy dose of exhortation and </p>
<p>rebuke) towards obedience to and peace with God.</p>
<p>Wish-Prayer for Holiness (5:23–24)</p>
<p>Transitioning from the subject of discerning good and evil, Paul commenc-</p>
<p>es a second wish-prayer in this letter (cf. 1 ess 3:13–14). In keeping with </p>
<p>themes found throughout the letter, Paul’s focus is on the essalonians </p>
<p>9. Given the ubiquity of interest across cultures in prophecy and oracles in the </p>
<p>ancient world, I nd it equally possible that local pagan or Jewish prophets attempted </p>
<p>to dissuade the essalonian believers from their faith, arguing that their new religion </p>
<p>kindled the anger of the local deities (or in the case of Jews, the One God, if they had </p>
<p>been Gentile god-fearers attached to the synagogue).</p>
