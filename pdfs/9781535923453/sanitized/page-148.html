<p>apostolic ministry. Paul must complete his mission of proclaiming </p>
<p>the gospel to the Gentiles before the rebellion. </p>
<p>Restrainer as Spiritual Power.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Some interpreters have advocated</p>
<p>for understanding the Restrainer in terms of a variety of good </p>
<p>spiritual powers, whether God, Jesus, the Spirit, or an angel. It </p>
<p>does not make much sense that the Restrainer would be Father, </p>
<p>Son, or Spirit since it is dicult to see how any of these could be </p>
<p>“removed” to make way for the Lawless One (2:7). But there is </p>
<p>much support for the view that he is an angel, and more speci-</p>
<p>cally the archangel Michael (see Dan 12:1; Jude 9; Rev 12:7).</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>None of these views can be proven from the meager information Paul </p>
<p>oers to us, but the third view has garnered the most support in recent years </p>
<p>and has much in its favor. If an angel (like Michael) is currently restraining </p>
the Lawless One, he is doing so according to a divine timetable: “it is ulti-
<p>mately God who will allow the rebel to be manifested only when the pres-</p>
<p>ent opportunity for preaching and hearing the gospel is brought to an end </p>
<p>by the removal of the angelic gure who is now in charge. en the power </p>
<p>of evil, which has been at work secretly in the world, but nonetheless ef-</p>
<p>fectively, will be openly manifested so as to produce the nal showdown.”</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>In 2:7, Paul emphasizes that, in spite of the present operation of a re-</p>
<p>strainer, the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. e modern use of the </p>
<p>word “mystery” tends to involve something enigmatic, a riddle or puzzle. </p>
<p>at is not how Paul uses the word here. Rather, the work of lawlessness is a </p>
<p>mysterion (Paul’s Greek word) insofar as it is kept hidden.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>is mystery of</p>
<p>lawlessness is apparently active, but “bears only a provisional character.”</p>

<p>the demon Asmodeus ees to “the remotest parts of Egypt,” but the angel Raphael follows </p>
<p>him there and binds him hand and foot (Tob 8:3).</p>

<p>25. Marshall, 200. In all these matters, though, Raymond Brown’s caution is appro-</p>
<p>priate: “Much of the discussion assumes that the author was clear in his own mind as to </p>
<p>the identity of both the lawless man and the restrainer. It is not impossible, however, that </p>
<p>the author received the imagery from tradition and that, without being able to identify </p>
<p>them, in the current situation he believed only that the lawless one had not come and </p>
<p>therefore the restrainer must be at work” (Brown 1997: 597); also, regarding an agnostic </p>
<p>view towards the identity of the restrainer, Gordon Fee: “From our present distance the </p>
<p>best position would seem to be, ‘Wait and see’” (2009: 288).</p>
