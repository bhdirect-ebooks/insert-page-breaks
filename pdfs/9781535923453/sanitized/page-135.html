<p>anksgiving and Hope (2 ess 1:1–12) 123</p>
<p>In this next section of the rst chapter of 2 essalonians, Paul transi-</p>
<p>tions from a word of thanksgiving for the essalonians’ perseverance in </p>
<p>persecution to a theological reection on the meaning of this suering. It </p>
<p>is easy for someone who is suering to wonder if the aiction is a form of </p>
<p>punishment or retribution from God. Perhaps unbelieving neighbors and </p>
<p>family members of the essalonians even told them that their communal </p>
<p>suerings were due to wrath from above. </p>
<p>Paul’s goal in this section is to reassure the essalonians in regards </p>
<p>to (a) the path they have chosen in Messiah Jesus (and for which they are </p>
<p>suering) and (b) the just work of God not only in spite of persecution but </p>
<p>even within and through it. e problem that interpreters face is that 1:5 </p>
<p>addresses “evidence” (endeigma) of the right judgment of God, but modern </p>
<p>readers are simply unsure about what Paul is counting as this “evidence.” Is </p>
<p>the evidence or proof that the essalonians are persevering? Or is the evi-</p>
<p>dence that the essalonians are suering? Which option (suering or per-</p>
<p>severance) is the basis for Paul’s appeal to God’s fairness (=right judgment)?</p>
Scholars are divided on this interpretive crux. ere is strong support
<p>for the view that Paul considers the “evidence” to be the suering itself.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e rationale behind this tends to appeal to Jewish tradition. ere are </p>
<p>some Jewish texts that carry an idea that God might see it t to punish his </p>
<p>people in the present time, so that they do not have to face damnation at a </p>
<p>day of reckoning. Psalms of Solomon 13:10–12 is typically used by scholars </p>
<p>as a representative of this viewpoint:</p>
<p>For the Lord spares his pious ones, and blots out their errors by his </p>
<p>chastening. For the life of the righteous will be forever; but sinners </p>
<p>will be taken away into destruction, and their memorial will be </p>
<p>found no more. But upon the pious is the mercy of the Lord, and </p>
<p>upon them that fear Him His mercy. (Pss 13:10–1) </p>
<p>Similarly, even more explicitly, we have the statement from R. Akiba </p>
<p>in Genesis Rabbah 33.1:</p>
<p>[God] deals strictly with the righteous, calling them to account for </p>
<p>the few wrongs which they commit in this world, in order to lavish </p>
<p>bliss upon and give them a goodly reward in the world to come; he </p>
<p>grants ease to the wicked and rewards them for the few good deeds </p>
<p>which they have performed in this world in order to punish them </p>
<p>in the future world.</p>
