<p>for these suering fellow-believers. us, when he calls them “brothers and </p>
<p>sisters,” not only does this remind them that they are siblings to each other, </p>
<p>but also that he is their brother through Jesus. Yet, he is not unwilling to mix </p>
<p>metaphors, even familial ones! He also portrays himself in comparison to </p>
<p>a mother tenderly nourishing her beloved (2:7) and also a father encouraging </p>
<p>his children (2:11–12).</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>When Paul writes about the pain he felt having to</p>
<p>leave them prematurely, he says that “we were made orphans by being sepa-</p>
<p>rated from you” (2:17). Only such a profound word-picture could convey </p>
<p>the heartbreak he felt at being removed from their presence.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>For Paul,</p>
<p>again, the church was not like a family, it was family.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>Cult</p>
<p>In 1 essalonians, the second key image from which Paul draws comes </p>
<p>from the Jewish cult, particularly Jewish notions of holiness, purity, and </p>
<p>sacrice.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>e foundation for how Jews understood holiness comes from</p>
<p>their idea of a holy God, a God who is all-powerful, perfect in all righteous-</p>
<p>ness, and yet also perfect in love and mercy.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>When God brought Israel</p>
<p>out of Egypt, he called them to be a holy nation (Exod 19:6), a people set </p>
<p>apart for himself. eir way of life was meant to be in contrast to that of the </p>
<p>sinful world, and also they were intended to display the true nature of their </p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>Holiness and purity were also important when it came to temple</p>
<p>service and sacrice. Priests must be consecrated, and part of their priestly </p>
<p>service was to “distinguish between the holy and the common, and between </p>
<p>the unclean and the clean” (Lev 10:10). Very specic protocols existed for </p>
<p>how things were to be done. Atoning animals oered in sacrice must be </p>

<p>on 1 essalonians 2:7, see McNeel 2014: 123–74.</p>

<p>57. See Psalm 77.</p>
<p>58. See Goheen 2011: 193: “e lives of the people of Israel look backward to cre-</p>
<p>ation; they embody God’s original creational design for the whole of human life. eir </p>
<p>lives look forward to the consummation: they are a sign of the goal to which God is </p>
<p>taking redemptive history. . . . eir lives are to face outward to the nations; they are to </p>
<p>be a contrast community, leading lives that dier from those of the peoples around them. </p>
<p>Israel is to challenge the cultural idolatry of the surrounding nations while embracing the </p>
<p>cultural gis God has given it.” is is a nice vision of the fullness of what it meant for the </p>
<p>people to be “holy” as a covenantal obligation.</p>
