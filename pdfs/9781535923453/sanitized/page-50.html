<p>Thanksgiving for the Thessalonians </p>
<p>(1 Thess 1:1–10)</p>
<p>Prescript (1:1)</p>
<p>1:1 </p>
<p>Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the essalonians </p>
<p>in God the Father and the Lord Messiah Jesus—grace and peace </p>
<p>to you. </p>
<p>Ancient letters of Paul’s time began much like what we see in 1 essalo-</p>
<p>nians: sender—recipient—greeting. In this case, while Paul uses “I” several </p>
<p>times throughout the letter (2:18; 3:5; 5:27), he lists his co-workers Silvanus </p>
<p>and Timothy. It is probably not the case that they served as co-writers in </p>
<p>a formal sense, but rather Paul wanted to express that he functioned as </p>
<p>part of a larger group (and Timothy and Silvanus were people whom they </p>
<p>already knew; 3:2). While we think of Paul as the apostle to the Gentiles, we </p>
<p>must remember that, even in the account of Paul’s acceptance by the “pillar </p>
<p>apostles” in Galatians, it is Paul and Barnabas who receive the right hand of </p>
<p>fellowship (Gal 2:9). He oen demonstrated a hearty spirit of community </p>
<p>and collaboration—as 2 Cor 1:19 reminds us, Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy </p>
<p>proclaimed the gospel as a team.</p>
<p>In most of his letters, Paul identies himself as apostle or slave, but </p>
<p>here he is simply “Paul.” e most likely reason for this unadorned appella-</p>
<p>tion is that he was not determined to reinforce his authority, and he wished </p>
<p>to write a simple letter of encouragement and teaching for a church that he </p>
<p>loved and cared about deeply.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Paul writes to the church of the essalonians in God the Father </p>
<p>and the Lord Messiah Jesus. Perhaps, in our familiarity with this kind of </p>
<p>language in Paul’s letters we might miss its potency. Paul was marking the </p>
<p>identity of this community as primarily determined by their relationship </p>
<p>with God and Jesus the Messiah, and in particular that they now have life </p>
<p>and security and wholeness of their being within the ambit of that realm. </p>
