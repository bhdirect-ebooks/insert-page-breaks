<p>Paul’s Blameless Ministry (1 ess 2:1–12)58</p>
<p>Paul knew that good fathers were invested in seeing to it that their chil-</p>
<p>dren matured and had opportunities to thrive. He loved them like just that </p>
<p>sort of mentor and guardian. e word for comforting (paramytheomai) </p>
<p>is typically used by Greek writers of Paul’s time in view of some occasion </p>
<p>of sadness (e.g., John 11:19, 31); hence a common meaning for the verb is </p>
<p>“to console” or “to cheer up.” Why might Paul have been consoling them? </p>
<p>We might learn from the way Jewish historian Josephus used similar lan-</p>
<p>guage. While recounting the Hebrew war against the Amalekites, Josephus </p>
<p>notes that the latter were known to be adroit and advanced in military skills </p>
<p>compared to the people of Israel. is terried the Israelites and they were </p>
<p>despondent.</p>
<p>Moses accordingly proceeded to console (paramythia) them. He </p>
<p>bade (parakaleō)</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>them take courage, trusting in God’s decrees,</p>
<p>through which they had been promoted to liberty and triumphed </p>
<p>over such as set themselves in battle against them to dispute it </p>
<p>(Ant. 3.44, ackeray). </p>
<p>It is possible, in light of this sort of usage, that Paul was embodying </p>
<p>a kind, Moses-like encouragement to a essalonian community troubled </p>
<p>by threat and persecution. Just as Moses was compassionate and concerned </p>
<p>for his people, so Paul for his own people.</p>
<p>Paul saw his mission as focused, not only on winning converts, but </p>
<p>training them up to be worthy of God; that is, to live up to God’s high </p>
<p>standards (see Phil 1:27). Paul reminds them that God has called them into </p>
<p>his own “kingdom and glory” (literally). is is probably a hendiadys that </p>
<p>should be translated “glorious kingdom” (cf. 1 Chron 29:25; Matt 4:8). By </p>
<p>referring to the calling of God, Paul may have been appealing, again, to </p>
<p>their new identity as those who are precious to God and carefully watched </p>
<p>over by a God who is near (see 1:4). It could also reect the sort of idea </p>
<p>found in Rom 8:30 that those whom he has graciously called are expected </p>
<p>to move along a trajectory of life towards glorication (doxazō in Rom </p>
<p>8:30; doxa in 1 ess 2:12). is might have encouraged the essalonians </p>
<p>that, despite the pressures of conict and shame from their neighbors and </p>
<p>compatriots, the God who adopted them into his family would see them all </p>
<p>the way through to an end that would prove them valuable and innocent </p>
<p>(see Phil 2:5–11). Aer all, “e one who calls you is faithful, he will also </p>
<p>19. Paramythia is closely related to paramytheomai; parakaleō is the same verb used </p>
<p>by Paul in 1 ess 2:12.</p>
