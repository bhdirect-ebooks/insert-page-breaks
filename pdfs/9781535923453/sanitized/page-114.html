<p>e Day of the Lord: Preparedness and Perseverance, not Prediction102</p>
<p>addressed and Paul focuses on the more important question regarding </p>
<p>the “how” of Christian living. He switches from a purely temporal view </p>
<p>of “days” and “nights” to an ethical discussion of “day/light”-people and </p>
<p>“night/darkness”-people. e key theme that pervades this passage is vigi-</p>
<p>lance—Christian mental sobriety and alertness in a time of spiritual torpor </p>
<p>and ethical perversion. While this section is brief, there are three parts: </p>
<p>Ready for the Night ief (5:1–3), You are Day and Light People (5:4–7), </p>
<p>and Battle as Day People (5:8–11).</p>
<p>Ready for the Night ief (5:1–3)</p>
<p>Again, as noted above, Paul commences this section with a clear interest </p>
<p>in the topic of “times and seasons.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>is phrase appears to refer to phases</p>
<p>in a timeline, as we read in Eccl 4:1: “for all things, there is a time and </p>
<p>season for every matter under heaven.” A couple of Jewish texts focus on the </p>
<p>mysterious nature of how God plans periods and events (Dan 2:21; Wis-</p>
<p>dom 8:1–8).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>One can only guess why the essalonians should be taught</p>
<p>(or reminded) about the eschatological timing. Perhaps it was that some </p>
<p>wanted details regarding the Parousia because they were uncertain that it </p>
<p>was going to happen. In that case, Ernest Best is right that Paul’s point is its </p>
<p>“unpredictability, and yet its inevitability.”</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>I think the situation, though,</p>
<p>is closer to what Malherbe proposes, namely that the essalonians were </p>
<p>confused by the predictions of local prophets. Now, Malherbe and Furnish </p>
<p>suggest that it was Christian prophets who made such prognostications. </p>
<p>However, we should entertain the possibility that it was Jewish (non-Chris-</p>
<p>tian) prophets who may have predicted impending doom for the essalo-</p>
<p>nians because of their apostasy and failure to continue to respect and revere </p>
<p>2. In the past scholars have tried to make a distinction between the meaning of </p>
<p>times (chronos) and the meaning of seasons (kairos), but there appears to be no such </p>
<p>distinction made by Paul. In terms of this being a kind of stock phrase, I could nd no </p>
<p>evidence that it was such in the Greek world. Out of hundreds of ancient (pagan) Greek </p>
<p>texts, only one appears to use this collocation, though not exactly in the order we nd in </p>
<p>1 ess 5:1 (Dem. 23.141; “seasons and times”).</p>
<p>3. e closest parallel to Paul’s own wording is Acts 1:6–7 where the disciples ask </p>
<p>about the time of the restoration of the “kingdom of Israel” and Jesus replies: “It is not </p>
<p>for you to know the times or periods that the Father has set by his own authority.” Jesus </p>
<p>tells his disciples that the Spirit-empowered mission takes priority over eschatological </p>
<p>knowledge—no doubt Paul echoes this sentiment.</p>
