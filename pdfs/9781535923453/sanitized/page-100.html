<p>Exhortation to Persevere and Grow in Holiness, Love, and Integrity88</p>
<p>expected to carry her own load (Gal 6:6), though there are obvious occa-</p>
<p>sions when we must carry one another’s burdens (Gal 6:2). </p>
<p>Sometimes scholars have argued that Paul operated, especially in such </p>
<p>an early letter (like 1 essalonians), under an “interim ethic” where cer-</p>
<p>tain moral expectations were hastily put into place in view of the imminent </p>
<p>return of Jesus. Certainly Paul had no reason not to think Jesus would come </p>
<p>soon and suddenly, but the fact that in 1 ess 4:12 he moves the churches </p>
<p>towards having no one directly dependent on another (and that everyone </p>
<p>paid their own way, as it were) means that he desired, as a matter of rst </p>
<p>principle, that believers live in a self-sustaining community.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>Excursus: Work and Quietness</p>
<p>Paul’s instructions in 4:11 are peculiar for a number of reasons. First, why </p>
<p>does he tell these Thessalonians to work with their hands? Should the em-</p>
<p>phasis fall on hands (i.e., manual labor) or simply on work (versus inactivity)? </p>
<p>Second, why does he tell them to be quiet and to mind their own business? Is </p>
<p>the “quietness” about silence or about tranquility/peace? </p>
<p>There was a time when some scholars connected problems of idleness </p>
<p>and unproductive fervor with the Thessalonians’ misunderstandings about the </p>
<p>end times. In 1912, James Frame made this comment: “It may be assumed </p>
<p>that the belief in the coming of the Lord had created in the midst of some </p>
<p>of the converts a feeling of restlessness and excitement which manifested </p>
<p>itself outwardly in idleness and meddlesomeness in the affairs of the brother-</p>
<p>hood. The idlers, we may imagine, being in want, had asked support from </p>
<p>the church, and being refused on the ground that they were able to support </p>
<p>themselves, had attempted to interfere in the affairs of the group.”</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>However, some scholars have wondered, if the “problem” was presump-</p>
<p>tions about the impending end of the world, why does Paul wait until 5:1–11 </p>
<p>to talk about the true timing of the return of Jesus (instead of right after 4:9–</p>
<p>12)?</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>Others relate this issue of idleness with more typical social problems</p>
<p>in society. Richard Ascough has argued in favor of viewing the Thessalonian </p>
<p>church as a converted “voluntary association,” a kind of social club.</p>
