<p>Praiseworthy Endurance Amidst Persecution (1ess 2:13–16)62</p>
<p>before him. Paul touches upon a kind of ignorance motif. Ostensibly well-</p>
<p>intentioned people are sometimes blind to the horrically unholy acts they </p>
<p>are committing. What Paul communicates here is remarkably reminiscent </p>
<p>of John 16:2–3 where Jesus warns his disciples: “ey will put you out of the </p>
<p>synagogues. Indeed, an hour is coming when those who kill you will think </p>
<p>that by doing so they are oering worship to God. And they will do this </p>
<p>because they have not known the Father or me.” Paul takes his statement a </p>
<p>step further to say that, despite the ignorance and opaque judgment of the </p>
persecutors, their sinful hostility will meet divine reckoning in the end. In
<p>2:16, Paul writes that God’s “wrath” has come upon them “eis telos”—liter-</p>
<p>ally “to the end.” What does this mean? F. F. Bruce is probably on the right </p>
<p>track when he explains it this way: “ey have reached the point of no </p>
<p>return in their opposition to the gospel and nal, irremediable retribution </p>
<p>is inevitable; indeed, it has come.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>us, we have translated it “God’s anger</p>
<p>for justice has come upon them and there is no turning back.”</p>
<p>While Paul’s overall message in this passage (2:13–16) is clear and ts </p>
<p>the major concerns of the letter as a whole, scholars have debated intensely </p>
<p>whether or not Paul could have written such a negative statement and con-</p>
<p>demnation about his own Jewish people.</p>
<p>Excursus: Could Paul Have Written 1 Thess 2:14–16? </p>
<p>Paul’s words in 1 Thess 2:14–16 are so ostensibly damning in the view of </p>
<p>many scholars that some have labeled Paul anti-Semitic, while others con-</p>
<p>clude that, if Paul could not write such a statement, this section must be a </p>
<p>post-Pauline fabrication.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Opting for the excision of these verses might bring</p>
<p>us some relief, but without support from the extant manuscripts, labeling </p>
<p>these verses as a later editorial insertion seems hasty.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>So, if Paul is responsible for these words, was he prejudicially hateful </p>
<p>towards Jews? This seems unlikely coming from a Jew whom we know held </p>
<p>his own people so close to his heart (see Rom 9:1–5). It is important to note, </p>
<p>1. Bruce 1982: 48 (cf. Ps 52:5/LXX Ps 51:7).</p>
<p>2. See Pearson 1971: 79-94; Koester 1979:33–44; Scholars Version Paul (see Dewey </p>
<p>et al. 2010). On the matter of which verses in particular are considered an interpolation, </p>
<p>theories dier on whether it should be 2:13–16 or 2:14–16.</p>
<p>3. We know of no manuscripts of 1 essalonians in existence that do not have </p>
<p>these verses. On the folly of cutting out oensive biblical texts, see Johnson 1989: 421.</p>
