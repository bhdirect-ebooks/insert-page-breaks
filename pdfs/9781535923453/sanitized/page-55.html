<p>Fusing the Horizons: Blood-Blind in the New Covenant Community 43</p>
<p>demonstrates that, for him, this was more than a rhetorical device or banal </p>
<p>label. Perhaps, even, the Thessalonians would have felt a bit of a shock when </p>
<p>Paul started talking about “love between siblings” (philadelphia)—the kind of </p>
<p>endearment and care that related to real family members (1 Thess 4:9).</p>
<p>In most churches that I visit, rarely have I seen this kind of “blood-</p>
<p>blindness” of which Paul writes. But I have seen it once. In the late 1990s I </p>
<p>did some missionary work in Eastern Europe. In Macedonia, ethnic Albanians </p>
<p>(about 20 percent of the population) and ethnic Macedonians have a history </p>
of conﬂict. On the streets, everyone is conscious of the cultural dividing lines
<p>between Albanians and ethnic Macedonians and the hostility is palpable. But </p>
<p>in our college ministry communities we saw something amazing—Albanians </p>
<p>and Macedonians, not only sitting together and singing, but hugging and </p>
<p>sharing and loving one another without hatred or prejudice. St. Paul would </p>
<p>have felt proud that his siblingship theology took root in that community and </p>
<p>blossomed.</p>
<p>How do we view the people around us in our own churches? Are they </p>
<p>strangers with whom we exchange friendly greetings? When needs are raised, </p>
<p>do we feel responsible to take care of one another? Has the gospel properly </p>
<p>“blinded” us to blood?</p>
<p>e second descriptor Paul uses for the essalonians is that they </p>
<p>are “loved by God,” or “God’s beloved” (1 ess 1:4). No doubt, Paul was </p>
<p>applying to the essalonians a description that characterized the Lord’s </p>
<p>intimate love for Israel: “When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of </p>
<p>Egypt I called my son” (Hos 11:1; cf. Isa 5:1; 57:8; Jer 12:7; Mal 1:2). Oen, </p>
<p>in the Old Testament, the Lord’s armations of his love came at a time </p>
<p>when Israel felt abandoned. Perhaps this too applies to Paul’s use. at is, in </p>
<p>spite of all the essalonians were going through, God’s own relationship </p>
<p>and attitude towards them was secure (cf. Rom 8:38–39). ey are not part </p>
<p>of a nameless, faceless mass down below while God sits at a far distance in </p>
<p>heaven. e ones called “beloved” are truly known by God and he cares for </p>
<p>them deeply. </p>
<p>e third descriptor follows quite closely from the second: God chose </p>
<p>them (1 ess 1:4). e focus here (eklogē) is not a kind of one-sided elec-</p>
<p>tion (i.e. “predestination”), but more a testimony to how precious they are </p>
<p>in God’s eyes. Imagine a couple passing by an alley and noticing a poor, </p>
