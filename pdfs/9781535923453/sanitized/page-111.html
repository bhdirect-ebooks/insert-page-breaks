<p>Fusing the Horizons: The New Covenant People of Hope</p>
<p>In the few weeks that I was writing this chapter, there was a shooting at </p>
<p>Seattle Paciﬁc University (SPU) where I had been a faculty member only two </p>
<p>years prior. A couple of students were very seriously injured and one young </p>
<p>man lost his life. Even though I was living 2700 miles away when the incident </p>
<p>happened, the reality of this event hit home for me because one SPU student </p>
<p>tackled the shooter and immobilized him, and that brave student was in the </p>
<p>introductory Bible class at SPU I taught when he was a sophomore. </p>
<p>The United States has endured a long string of these school shootings </p>
<p>in its recent history, but rarely does this happen on the campus of a Christian </p>
<p>college. Newspapers were quick to notice the SPU community response to this </p>
<p>tragedy. On the one hand, students did not shortcut the need to express grief </p>
<p>and lament. On the other hand they dared to cling to Christian hope. One SPU </p>
<p>staff worker who was interviewed by the Seattle Times said this: “Each of us </p>
<p>felt the weight of this horror and grief, but we were not lost. The essence of </p>
<p>the Christian faith that we teach and try to embody on this campus gave us </p>
<p>the words and the vision we were looking for. The central proclamation of our </p>
<p>faith is that our cruciﬁed Lord was raised back to life. God has the power and </p>
<p>the will to restore and redeem all that has been terrorized and lost.” </p>
<p>Another noticeable response from the SPU community was authentic </p>
<p>fellowship. A graduate student at SPU shared with reporters her appreciation </p>
<p>for this community of support: “What I’m seeing most is the desire to really </p>
<p>be together, to ﬁnd each other, to look after each other. To both give and </p>
<p>receive the love of Christ.” To these statements no doubt Paul would say amen </p>
<p>and amen. The new covenant community grieves with hope in the radically </p>
<p>transformative work of Jesus that has come and will come again in a consum-</p>
<p>mating way. For now we are called to be a with-each-other and for-each-other </p>
<p>fellowship. This is not only good medicine for the soul, but it is a part of </p>
<p>Christian testimony, the bearing of the likeness of Jesus in the world. Observe </p>
<p>these words that SPU professor Richard Steele shared with the community </p>
<p>after the SPU tragedy.</p>
<p>We can experience anger, even rage, but we do not give vent to </p>
<p>vengefulness. We can experience intense grief but we do not lose </p>
<p>hope. We recognize the brokenness in ourselves and therefore try </p>
<p>to extend compassion and mercy to other people whose broken-</p>
