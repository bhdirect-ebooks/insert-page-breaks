<p>Introduction 37</p>
<p>and very particular problems there, repeating the rst letter quite closely </p>
<p>in some ways, and yet obviously wanting to say something new.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>Unless</p>
<p>these issues can be resolved, it seems to me to be the most sensible option to </p>
<p>attempt to understand the letter as it is written, Paul to the essalonians.</p>
<p>103. So, in a forthcoming commentary, Andy Johnson asks (calling into question the </p>
<p>plausibility of pseudonymity): “If someone knew 1 essalonians as part of a corpus of </p>
<p>Pauline letters that had begun circulating in the late rst or early second century and if </p>
<p>the theology of 2 essalonians really is so dierent from that of 1 essalonians and </p>
<p>the rest of Paul’s letters, how would the person have hoped to persuade anyone—at least </p>
<p>anyone familiar enough with Paul or this corpus to care about a writing in the name of </p>
<p>Paul—that 2 essalonians was from him?” See Johnson 2016.</p>
