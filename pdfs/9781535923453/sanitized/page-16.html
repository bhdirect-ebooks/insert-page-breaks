<p>A few years later, essalonica was</p>
<p>named the capital of the province of Macedonia. e Romans took special </p>
<p>interest in this city largely for its size and location.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> ey built the Via Egna-</p>
<p>tia, a roadway that ran east-west from Dyrrhachium on the Adriatic Sea to </p>
<p>essalonica. It was intended, in the rst place, for military use, but became </p>
<p>a major thoroughfare for trade and travel more broadly.</p>
<p>About a century later, aer Julius Caesar was murdered, essalonica </p>
<p>again shrewdly supported Octavian and Mark Antony over and against </p>
<p>Brutus and Cassius. In return for this loyalty, Antony bestowed upon es-</p>
<p>salonica the status of civitas libera (free city). is special privilege meant </p>
<p>that essalonians could operate with considerable autonomy while also </p>
<p>receiving support from Rome.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Additionally it received tax concessions. It</p>
<p>is no exaggeration to say, then, that this status “ushered in a prosperous </p>
<p>new era for essalonica.”</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>By the time of Paul, essalonica was a large,</p>
<p>cosmopolitan city; Antipater of essalonica referred to it at the “mother of </p>
<p>all Macedonia.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>e largest ethnic population in essalonica at that time</p>
<p>was Greeks, but there is evidence for the presence of other groups including </p>
<p>Italians, racians, and Jews.</p>
<p>Religion in essalonica</p>
e religious atmosphere in Roman essalonica was diverse. While tra-
<p>ditional Greek deities were widely honored, including Zeus, Asclepius, </p>
<p>Aphrodite, and Demeter, the city also dedicated worship to Egyptian gods </p>
<p>such as Serapis and Isis. In 1917, an ancient temple was discovered in es-</p>
<p>salonica that is now called the Serapeion. is temple probably dates to </p>
<p>the third century BC. essalonians also had an interest in the myth of </p>
<p>Cabirus. We learn from Clement of Alexandria the legend of two brothers </p>
<p>who killed a third sibling and buried him at the foot of Mount Olympus. </p>
<p>Cabirus is depicted in worship as a young man with no beard. Devotees </p>
<p>worshipped the murdered Cabirus as a savior who would return and bless </p>
<p>the people, especially the poor.</p>
