<p>anksgiving for the essalonians (1 ess 1:1–10) 41</p>
<p>Pistis here is a word marking the orientation of the will—it is an active word </p>
<p>for Paul in the same way love (agapē) is an active word. In ancient Greek </p>
<p>literature, pistis was regularly used with the meaning of “pledge” or “bond.” </p>
<p>is reects aptly Paul’s concern: the essalonians were known for their </p>
<p>bold and active loyalty and obedience that are seen in real-life action or </p>
<p>work. Similarly, he commends them for their love that is marked by labor. </p>
<p>With these two statements about faith/love and work/labor, Paul is not try-</p>
<p>ing to make a strong and clear dierentiation between the two (“work” and </p>
<p>“labor”), but rather desires to look at their lives from several angles (loyalty, </p>
<p>hope, love). In 1:3, the “love” for which Paul gives thanks is possibly their </p>
<p>love for God, laboring and working out of aection for him. However, it is </p>
<p>probably a more comprehensive kind of love that is directed towards God </p>
<p>(vertically) and others (horizontally). In 3:6, aer Timothy is sent by Paul </p>
<p>to check on the essalonians, he brings back report of their “trust and </p>
<p>love” and that they wanted to see Paul as he did them.</p>
<p>e last element in 1:3 that Paul mentions is their track record of “en-</p>
<p>durance driven by hope in our Lord Messiah Jesus.” Sometimes hypomonē </p>
<p>(“endurance”) is translated as “patience,” but this word should be under-</p>
<p>stood here as more of an active term (moving forward in spite of resistance), </p>
<p>rather than a passive one (holding your ground).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>We have a perfect image</p>
<p>of this word in Hebrews 12:1 where the author presses the readers to “run </p>
<p>with endurance the race set out for us.” We know that the essalonians </p>
<p>were struggling with persecution as well (see introduction, 10–13). </p>
<p>I think a military analogy is also tting to portray this endurance. </p>
<p>Imagine a soldier training and preparing for war. He goes out into the battle </p>
<p>and, despite his extensive education, real war is simply a chaotic mess. It </p>
<p>is frenetic and long and exhausting. Endurance and courage are his allies. </p>
<p>e thought of giving up (in retreat or surrender) is natural, but that is </p>
<p>no way to win a war! Not to mention what the commander, let alone the </p>
<p>emperor, would say to a deserter! In the apocryphal text Sirach (written </p>
<p>not long before the time of Paul), Ben Sira wrote this to his readers: “Woe </p>
<p>to you who have lost your endurance! What will you do when the Lord’s </p>
<p>reckoning comes” (2:14)? e essalonians are not in this kind of trouble, </p>
<p>but they seem to be just at the place where they need some motivation to </p>
<p>press on in trust and faithfulness (see 1 ess 3:10). Paul’s advice is more </p>
<p>consonant with Ben Sira’s word a bit later on: “[God] encourages those who </p>
<p>of the dominant culture’s resistance and disapproval.”</p>
