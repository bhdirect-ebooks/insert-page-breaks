<p>Praiseworthy Endurance Amidst Persecution </p>
<p>(1 Thess 2:13–16) </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>And on account of this, as for us, we give thanks to God always, </p>
<p>because when you received the word of God as you heard it from </p>
<p>us, you embraced it not as the word of mortals, but as it truly is—</p>
<p>the word of God, which is at work among you who believe. </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>As </p>
<p>for you, you became imitators, my dear brothers and sisters, of the </p>
<p>churches of God in Messiah Jesus in Judea, because you suered </p>
<p>the same things by men in your own country as they did by the </p>
<p>Jews there. </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>ese Jews killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, </p>
<p>and drove us out too. What they are doing does not please God </p>
<p>and they make everyone an enemy </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>when they prevent us from </p>
<p>speaking to the Gentiles so they may be saved. ey are lling to </p>
<p>full the measure of their sins. God’s anger for justice has come </p>
<p>upon them and there is no turning back. </p>
<p>Again, in 2:13, Paul praises the essalonians for their initial reception of </p>
<p>the good news, receiving it as the “word of God,” not as a eeting, unfulll-</p>
<p>ing message from mere mortals. roughout 1 essalonians, Paul insists </p>
<p>that the one God is alive, powerful, and “at work” in an undeniable way </p>
<p>amongst the believers in essalonica (see 1:5). </p>
<p>Paul compares their faithful endurance to the experience of the be-</p>
<p>lievers in Judea—the essalonians persecuted by their own fellow citizens, </p>
<p>while the Jesus-following Jews by their own neighbors. e main point of </p>
<p>this passage is clear: the situation of the essalonians (under persecution) </p>
<p>is not unprecedented. It is part of a pattern that they share with the believers </p>
<p>in Judea. It seems unjust for the holy and faithful people of God who follow </p>
<p>the Messiah Jesus to be humiliated and to suer, and for the persecutors to </p>
<p>appear to prevail. How could God let this happen? is is clearly a theodicy </p>
<p>issue that Paul is addressing. Problems and questions like these can send </p>
<p>faith into a tailspin. Paul responds with a prophetic voice, urging that judg-</p>
<p>ment awaits those who lash out against God’s innocent people (2:16). </p>
<p>e essalonians’ unjust suering is not only analogous to that of the </p>
<p>believers in Judea, but also to the situation of Jesus himself and the prophets </p>
