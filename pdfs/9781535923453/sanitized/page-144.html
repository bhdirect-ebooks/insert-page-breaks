<p>Perseverance and Hope (2 ess 2:1–17)132</p>
<p>It is unlikely that any of the essalonians believed that the Day of </p>
<p>the Lord had “come and gone”—wouldn’t they have expected to see Jesus </p>
<p>himself? Maarten Menken has indeed tried to argue that somehow the </p>
<p>essalonians thought that “Christ had already returned to earth and was </p>
<p>already performing his task, or was on the point of doing so.”</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>I do not</p>
<p>see the evidence for this in 2 essalonians. Instead, Jerey Weima oers a </p>
<p>stronger interpretation arguing that certain troublemakers in essalonica </p>
<p>had sowed the seed of fear that this essalonian church was facing judg-</p>
<p>ment associated with the Day of the Lord, and it did not take much to whip </p>
<p>them into a frenzy. Weima compares this to the story of Chicken Little:</p>
<p>As revealed in the classic fable “Chicken Little” in which Henny </p>
<p>Penny has an acorn fall on her head and immediately runs around </p>
<p>yelling “e sky is falling! e sky is falling!,” fear is oen as ir-</p>
<p>rational as it is contagious. us, even though the claim “the day of </p>
<p>the Lord has come” may have seemed obviously false, it neverthe-</p>
<p>less caused the young church of essalonica to be scared out of </p>
<p>their wits, fearful of whether they would avoid the wrath connect-</p>
<p>ed with the day of judgment and instead experience salvation.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In such a case, Paul’s concern was to put their concerns to rest and </p>
<p>oer a proper vision of what was in store and how they would t into the </p>
<p>events yet to come.</p>
<p>Events Yet to Come: Apostasy with Lawless One, Final Victory of </p>
<p>Messiah (2:3–12)</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Let no one trick you in any way. For that day will not come unless </p>
<p>the rebellion happens rst and the Lawless Man, the Son of De-</p>
<p>struction, is revealed. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>He treats everyone as an enemy and thinks </p>
<p>himself superior to anything called “god” or any object of worship, </p>
<p>and so he takes his seat in the temple of God to demonstrate his </p>
divinity.
<p>6. See Menken 1994: 101, more generally 99–101.</p>
<p>7. Weima 2006: 77–78; see also Weima 2014: 503; Eadie makes a similar case: “e </p>
<p>day of the Lord, the epoch of the Second Advent had now dawned upon them, and the </p>
<p>persecutions now falling on them were tokens of its presence. ey regarded the day of </p>
<p>grace as apparently at an end, so that in fact they were in the period of judgment, which </p>
<p>was to witness the dissolution of society and the introduction of a new state of things”; </p>
<p>see Eadie 1877: 263–64.</p>
