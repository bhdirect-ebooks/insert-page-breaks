<p>Paul’s Blameless Ministry (1 ess 2:1–12)54</p>
<p>ists do; 2:4b). ey never tried to win the essalonians with attery, nor </p>
<p>masking greed (2:5).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Aristotle clues us into the Hellenistic concern with</p>
<p>hucksters when he wrote: “the man who joins in gratifying people…for </p>
<p>the sake of getting something for himself in the way of money or money’s </p>
<p>worth is a atterer” (Eth. Nic. 4.6.9).</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Paul was not in the business of making himself the center of attention </p>
<p>(2:6). His focus was on bringing glory to the Messiah. But, he notes in 2:7, </p>
<p>it was within his rights to demand their respect as “apostles of the Messiah.” </p>
<p>Literally, he writes that he had “the ability in heaviness,” meaning he had </p>
<p>the requisite credentials to throw his weight around (so CEB), but he chose </p>
<p>not to behave that way with them. His use of the word weight (baros) here </p>
<p>points forward to his employment of a related word epibareō in 1 ess </p>
<p>2:9b: “night and day we were working to prevent burdening (epibareō) any </p>
<p>of you.” By use of wordplay, he argues that while he had authoritative weight </p>
<p>(baros) as an apostle such that he could make demands on them, he lov-</p>
<p>ingly chose to work extra hard so as not to weigh (epibareō) them down. </p>
<p>Paul’s Tender Care (2:7b–12)</p>
<p>While Paul is rm on the point that he has acted “above-board,” as it were, </p>
<p>throughout his ministry with and towards them, he also underscores, es-</p>
<p>pecially in 2:7b–12, his tender care for the essalonians. In 2:7b we nd </p>
<p>a statement that contains one of most contested textual problems in the </p>
<p>whole of the New Testament. Does Paul write that he was gentle (ēpioi) in </p>
<p>their midst, or that he was like an infant (nēpioi) with them? Translations </p>
are divided on this matter, but there is slightly better reason to side with the
<p>reading of “infant” (nēpioi).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>6. If Paul worked hard not to burden the essalonians with requests for nancial </p>
<p>support for his livelihood and ministry, how could he be worried about being seen as </p>
<p>greedy? In the introduction to this section (2:1–12), I entertained the possibility that, </p>
<p>while he did not ask for money, he may have accepted gis (see Phil 4:15). Ambrosiaster, </p>
<p>writing in the fourth century AD, made a comment that, in Paul’s refusal of “small gis,” </p>
<p>some locals may have wondered if he was hoping for larger ones (see Bray 2009: 103).</p>
