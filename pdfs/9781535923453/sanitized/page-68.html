<p>Excursus: Gentle or Infants? (2:7b)56</p>
<p>would modify a confusing idea in order to make it simpler, rather than make it </p>
<p>more inscrutable. In this case, proponents of n</p>
<p>ē</p>
<p>pioi ﬁnd it more likely that a </p>
<p>scribe saw “infants” and felt that this may have been a mistake and removed </p>
<p>the nu, reasoning that “gentle” (</p>
<p>ē</p>
<p>pioi) made more sense.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>But what about the</p>
<p>awkward mixed metaphors where Paul is an infant, one moment, and a nurs-</p>
<p>ing mother the next? I concur with Cousar that “The vulnerability of ‘infants,’ </p>
<p>combined with the tender, loving care of the lactating nurse (providing milk </p>
<p>and nurture not to someone else’s children but to her own) present a double </p>
<p>counterpoint to the picture of demanding apostles.”</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Gordon Fee argues that the awkwardness of the combining of different </p>
<p>metaphors is somewhat weakened if they are seen as completely separate </p>
<p>ideas. Thus, Fee treats 1 Thess 2:1–7b as its own thought-unit (ending with </p>
<p>“But we were like young children among you”) and considers 7c-8 (“Just as a </p>
<p>nursing mother cares for her children, so we cared for you”) as the beginning </p>
<p>of another section that reaches until v. 12. He concludes, “seen as separate </p>
<p>sentences, they [2:7b and 2:7c in his sentencing] can easily be explained as </p>
<p>in keeping with similar sudden shifts of metaphor elsewhere in Paul, where </p>
<p>one metaphor triggers another in the apostle’s mind, and thus are related </p>
<p>primarily by ‘catchword’ and not by consistency in application.”</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>For the</p>
<p>reasons given by Cousar, Fee, and others (see footnote 8), I lean in favor of </p>
<p>the n</p>
<p>ē</p>
<p>pioi reading. </p>
<p>Paul’s point in calling himself (and his other apostolic partners) in-</p>
<p>fants would be that they neither seek power nor honor, and that they are </p>
<p>not atterers seeking personal fame or fortune.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>From the imagery of infants, Paul switches to the metaphor of “nurs-</p>
<p>ing mother” (2:7b). What both these images have in common is the kind of </p>
<p>innocent love that is given and shared amongst close family members. at </p>
<p>sense of intimacy is reinforced by the language of her own children—that </p>
<p>is, the children she holds most dear, those closest to her, the ones she nurtures </p>
<p>and cherishes and feeds from her own body.</p>
