<p>of Paul, it could be used for those who are lazy/idle, or it could be used for </p>
<p>those who are rebellious. Only context, in the case of 1–2 essalonians, </p>
<p>can oer further specicity. Until relatively recently, there has been a trend </p>
<p>for translations to default to the meaning “idle” (so RSV, ESV), however the </p>
<p>case for this kind of interpretation is somewhat misguided. e inspiration </p>
<p>for referring to these people as “idlers” probably comes from the idea that </p>
<p>they were not working for a living (2 ess 3:8, 11). However, as Michael </p>
<p>Holmes demonstrates, “the people in question are in fact active, not ‘idle’ </p>
<p>or ‘lazy.’ . . . e problem, in other words, was not inactivity, but the wrong </p>
<p>kind of activity (as busybodies).”</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Marshall adds the point that Paul is not</p>
<p>addressing people who simply don’t work, but rather people who do not </p>
<p>want to work (theleō, 3:10).</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> Perhaps the best solution is to try and repre-</p>
<p>sent in translation both the non-working and the unruliness.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Gordon Fee</p>
<p>uses “disruptive-idle,” we have oered the translation “idle troublemakers.” </p>
<p>But why were they causing trouble? is is one of the most debated </p>
<p>issues in the study of the essalonian correspondence. e traditional </p>
<p>interpretive view is that their idleness is linked to an expectation of the </p>
<p>imminent return of the Lord Jesus; so Leon Morris writes: “e thought of </p>
<p>the nearness of the Parousia had thrown them into a utter, and this had led </p>
<p>to unwelcome consequences of which their idleness was the outstanding </p>
<p>f e at u r e .”</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>In the last few decades, though, this view has been questioned,</p>
<p>especially because Paul does not explicitly link the eschatological problems </p>
<p>with the unruly behavior of this group. Some have proposed that this was </p>
<p>a socio-economic problem whereby some were leeching o of wealthier </p>
<p>members of the church.</p>

<p>salonica in light of his lexical study of atakos and its cognates: “the ataktos is the one </p>
<p>who is defective in action, irregular, against the rule…e ataktoi essalonians free </p>
<p>themselves from the rule of community life. One thinks of sins against brotherly love, a </p>
<p>propensity to favor discord, a refusal to accept the customs or discipline of the church. </p>
<p>Certain ‘troubled’ ones seem particularly stormy, befuddled types who disturb the peace </p>
<p>(1 ess 4:11–12). At any rate, ‘their walk is not in line’ (Gal 2:14). ey are ‘culpable’ and </p>
