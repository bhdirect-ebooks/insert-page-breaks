<p>their lives and deeds (see Rom 2:6; 2 Pet 3:10). Paul prays, in regards to the </p>
<p>essalonians, not so that they may be fearful of the coming of Jesus, but </p>
<p>rather that they may have condence and assurance in view of blameless </p>
<p>and obedient lives.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Life Together</p>
<p>“Join us for our fellowship hour after the service!” How many churches con-</p>
<p>clude their worship by welcoming visitors to have “fellowship” in the next </p>
<p>room over coffee and donuts? The motivation behind this is obviously appro-</p>
<p>priate—many churches recognize how important it is that life in the church </p>
<p>is about a community of relationships. However, I fear that by talking about </p>
<p>this snack-enriched chatting hour as “fellowship,” we deﬁne it in a way that </p>
<p>would be quite alien to Paul. We in the West generally use the language of </p>
<p>fellowship as a way to refer to social gatherings. At its best, these gatherings </p>
<p>give encouragement and promote upbuilding. But even with these good things </p>
<p>in place, I am concerned that the essence of what fellowship is in the sense </p>
<p>that the early Christians meant remains obscure for many congregations. The </p>
<p>Greek word in the New Testament that is often translated as “fellowship” in </p>
<p>English Bibles is koin</p>
<p>ō</p>
<p>nia, and it literally means “commonness” or “shared-</p>
<p>ness.” Because this word could be used as a technical term in Paul’s world </p>
<p>for a business partnership or a marriage contract, one can get a sense for the </p>
<p>idea of “shared-ness” associated with koin</p>
<p>ō</p>
<p>nia.</p>
<p>In 1 Thessalonians, Paul does not actually use the word koin</p>
<p>ō</p>
<p>nia (though </p>
<p>he uses it regularly in several of his other letters), but you can easily see the </p>
<p>ﬁngerprints of the meaning of koin</p>
<p>ō</p>
<p>nia all over this letter and especially in </p>
<p>1 Thess 2:7—3:13. When two people or two groups agree to share life, then </p>
<p>being apart is a heavy burden. Hence Paul has the deepest longing to see the </p>
<p>Thessalonians, because they became so dear to him (2:17). They became </p>
<p>his own hope and joy and glory (2:19–20). When Paul wondered about how </p>
<p>adversity might affect the Thessalonian brothers and sisters, he could not </p>
<p>stand the thought of their confusion or doubt (3:5). His attachment to the </p>
<p>Thessalonian church was so strong that his own life itself was bound to their </p>
<p>faith in the Lord—their loss would be his loss, their triumph and loyalty in </p>
<p>the face of trials, a kind of resurrection from the dead for Paul himself (3:8). </p>
<p>Again, this vision differs from what I often see in our churches today, </p>
<p>because I rarely see the sort of Christian unity that is determined by, what </p>
