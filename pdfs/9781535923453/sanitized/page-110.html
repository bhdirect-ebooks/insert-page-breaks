<p>e Hopeful Fate of the Christian Dead (1 ess 4:13–18) 98</p>
<p>No doubt the essalonians could set their hope on this certain future </p>
<p>course of events as a kind of “reversal of fortune” for their Christian com-</p>
<p>munity. From a very narrow perspective, it might have felt to them like life </p>
<p>was bleak as they struggled with bereavement and ongoing persecution—</p>
<p>feeling perhaps like Paul did as he expressed his trials to the Corinthians </p>
<p>later on: “aicted in every way . . . perplexed . . . persecuted . . . struck </p>
<p>down” (2 Cor 4:8–9). But Paul encourages the essalonians in a way simi-</p>
<p>lar to how he later comforts the Corinthians. ings seem too far gone to </p>
<p>change, too hopeless to redeem. But in the snap of the ngers—a moment so </p>
<p>fast you may blink and miss it—God will change everything forever (1 Cor </p>
<p>15:52). And thanks be to God that he will stand the great conqueror Messiah </p>
<p>Jesus (1 Cor 15:57)!</p>
<p>And Paul can nish out his discourse with this: “comfort one another </p>
<p>with these words” (4:18). Again, the emphasis falls on restoration, par-</p>
<p>ticularly bringing together what feels torn apart. Believers le alive were </p>
<p>separated from those who died. ey will be reunited. Furthermore, there </p>
<p>is great encouragement in knowing that we will be with the Lord always </p>
<p>because he is our rock and our refuge. As Beverly Gaventa remarks, “To be </p>
<p>with the Lord is to be beyond the reach of evil.”</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>To put into historical perspective the important choice of words here </p>
<p>for Paul, we might appeal to an ancient letter found from Oxyrhynchus </p>
<p>(Egypt) that dates to the second century AD. It is a letter of sympathy to a </p>
<p>couple who lost their son.</p>
<p>Irene to Taonnophris and Philo, good cheer. I was as much grieved </p>
<p>and wept over the blessed one, as I wept for Didymas, and every-</p>
<p>thing that was tting I did and all who were with me, Epaphrodi-</p>
<p>tus and ermouthion and Philion and Apollonius and Plantas. </p>
<p>But truly there is nothing anyone can do in the face of such things. </p>
<p>Do you therefore comfort one another. Farewell. Hathyr I.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for some today, Irene faced the morose reality that loved ones die. </p>
<p>She tries to maintain a positive spirit by encouraging her friends to take </p>
<p>comfort. And yet there is no clear referent of that hope. But for Paul it was </p>
<p>not this way. Yes, of course people must grieve. But believers face the loss </p>
<p>knowing the impending work of God to wipe away every tear and quiet </p>
<p>mourning and shouts of agony (Rev 7:17; 21:4).</p>
