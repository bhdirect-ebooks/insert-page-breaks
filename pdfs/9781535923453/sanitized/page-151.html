<p>Perseverance and Hope (2 ess 2:1–17) 139</p>
<p>presumably the miracles will be supernatural, insofar as Satan can conjure </p>
<p>incredible things.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>Rather, the descriptor “false” means that the Lawless</p>
<p>One will do miracles as if God were authenticating his work, but rather he </p>
<p>will be in league with Satan. So, note Matt 24:24: “For false messiahs and </p>
<p>false prophets will rise up and perform great signs and omens, to lead astray, </p>
<p>if possible, even the elect” (cf. Mark 13:22); and Revelation 19:20a: “And the </p>
<p>beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who had performed in its </p>
<p>presence the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark </p>
<p>of the beast and who worshiped its image.”</p>
<p>e cooperative work of Satan and the Lawless One will deceive “those </p>
<p>who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved” </p>
<p>(2 ess 2:10). roughout the New Testament, there are warnings about </p>
<p>false prophets who seek to lead others astray into wickedness (Matt 7:15; </p>
<p>24:11; Mark 13:22; 1 John 4:1; Rev 19:20); so 2 Peter 2:1, where false teach-</p>
<p>ers have inltrated churches and secretly sowed “destructive opinions,” </p>
<p>even denying the Lord.</p>
<p>Paul adds the enigmatic statement that “For this reason God sends </p>
<p>them a powerful delusion, leading them to believe what is false” (NRSV). </p>
<p>It would seem that Paul is saying that God made them sin—but how can </p>
<p>God force people to sin? No doubt this is an alarming idea, but a similar </p>
<p>statement is made in Rom 1:18–32 regarding those who stubbornly refused </p>
<p>to acknowledge God; in their intractability, their resistance to God (of their </p>
<p>own will) became, as it were, supercharged by God, such that “God gave </p>
<p>them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity” (1:24); “God gave them up </p>
<p>to degrading passions” (1:26); and “God gave them up to a debased mind </p>
<p>and to things that should not be done” (1:28). I hope it is not too trite of </p>
<p>an example to compare this to when a teenager who is smoking is caught </p>
<p>by dad, and dad makes him nish the whole pack—by forcing one to dig </p>
<p>himself/herself deeper into their own slough of sin, the judgment stings, but </p>
<p>with a burn that still feels self-inicted (cf. Ps 81:12).</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>Paul’s words here may rest uneasy with us—the idea of God impressing </p>
<p>a delusion upon people that leads to their own downfall—but it may help </p>
<p>to keep Paul’s wider concern in sight. His aim in this letter is to comfort the </p>
<p>essalonians, by assuring them that the injustices of the persecutions they </p>
<p>are presently enduring will be overturned. In this context, it would make </p>
<p>32. See Fee 2009: 294; though note Ezek 13:9 where the Lord stands against prophets </p>
“who see false visions and utter lying divinations” (cf. 22:28). 33. On the issue of ethics and divine sovereignty, see Best 1986: 310.
