<p>Excursus: Whose Peace and Security?</p>
<p>First Thessalonians 5:3 offers many questions to the interpreter. Who are the </p>
<p>“they” that offer peace and security? What exactly is the danger or threat? </p>
<p>Why should the judgment of God come upon them? In the nineteenth century </p>
<p>and into most of the twentieth century, the common assumption was that </p>
<p>Paul was borrowing this language (“peace and security”) from a prophetic </p>
<p>tradition such as we ﬁnd in Jer 6:14 and Ezek 13:10.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>In the latter text, the</p>
<p>thirteen chapter involves Ezekiel’s responsibility to condemn the false proph-</p>
<p>ets of Israel. Ezekiel decried “they have misled my people, saying, ‘Peace’, </p>
<p>when there is no peace” (13:10a); and “the prophets of Israel who prophesied </p>
<p>concerning Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for it, when there is no peace, </p>
<p>says the Lord God” (13:16).</p>
<p>In the last few decades there has been a shift towards a reading that sees </p>
<p>“peace and security” as a slogan in support of Roman power and protection, </p>
<p>a source of security towards which Paul himself is apparently quite skepti-</p>
<p>cal.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>The literary and archaeological evidence for a similar (though not exact)</p>
<p>Roman motto is intriguing, though it seems many scholars appeal to this </p>
<p>interpretation without ﬂeshing out why Paul raises this matter at this point in </p>
<p>the letter. For my part, I do not ﬁnd this theory compelling for three reasons: </p>
<p>(1) if the “Roman slogan” reading is correct, it would have to pertain somehow </p>
<p>to 5:1–11 as a whole which is related to the aftermath of the traumatic death </p>
<p>of the Thessalonians whom Paul mentions—if they died due to a tragedy or </p>
<p>disease, how could Roman “peace” have stopped it? If they died due to local </p>
<p>persecution, why would Rome have stopped it, or why would they be promis-</p>
<p>ing security now, and did not safeguard it before? (2) Secondly, the fact that </p>
<p>the main verb is speciﬁc (“they say”) makes it seem that there are particular </p>
<p>people in mind who are saying this, rather than an appeal to a generic imperial </p>
<p>saying.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> Who would these people be? A scenario must be suggested to ac-</p>
<p>count for a local and direct appeal to this so-called Roman slogan. (3) Finally, </p>
<p>Lord returns, implying in eect ‘blessed are those who die in the Lord henceforth’” (see </p>
<p>2008: 167).</p>
<p>9. See Eadie 1877: 178; Bruce 1982: 109, Plummer 1918: 83.</p>
<p>10. See Bammel 1960: 837–40; Wengst 1987: 17–20, 76–79; Harrison 2011: 61–62; </p>
<p>Carter 2006: 89; cf. Weima 2012: 331–59.</p>
<p>11. For a more generic reference, you might have expected a phrasing like “when you </p>
<p>hear . . .” as in Deut 13:12; cf. Mark 13:7; Luke 21:9</p>
