<p>Excursus: Could Paul Have Written 1 ess 2:14–16? 63</p>
<p>right off the bat, that Paul was not condemning all Jews of all time in 1 </p>
<p>Thess 2:14–16, but speciﬁcally Jews in his present and past who had been </p>
<p>implicated in hostile actions towards Jesus and the Jesus-community.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Paul</p>
<p>is not making a discriminatory statement against an ethnic group as a whole.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>In an important article by Luke Timothy Johnson, which treats the sub-</p>
<p>ject of hostile rhetorical in early Christianity, Johnson makes a number of </p>
<p>critical points that inform our understanding of passages such as the one </p>
<p>under discussion here. Firstly, he notes how minority groups (such as the early </p>
<p>Christians, what Johnson calls the “messianists”) were relatively powerless in </p>
<p>the ancient world, and a defensive posture would be reasonably expected.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Secondly, though, Johnson points out that the Hellenistic models of slander </p>
<p>that we see from Paul’s time would have clued readers into the main point of </p>
<p>such rhetorical damnation: “The purpose of the polemic is not so much the </p>
<p>rebuttal of the opponent as the ediﬁcation of one’s own school. Polemic was </p>
<p>primarily for internal consumption.”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Put another way, Paul’s purpose was</p>
<p>not to stir up counter-violence against Jews, but rather to give comfort to the </p>
<p>afﬂicted Thessalonian believers, particularly assuring them that God is the </p>
<p>avenger in all things (cf. 1 Thess 4:6).</p>
<p>What should we do with this language today? It should be clear enough </p>
<p>that special sensitivity should be maintained in Jewish-Christian dialogue in </p>
<p>view of a history of mistreatment of Jews perpetrated under the ﬂag of Christian </p>
<p>witness. When Christians today face pressures from outsiders, it is altogether </p>
<p>appropriate to offer pastoral encouragement, especially that violence against </p>
<p>the people of God in Messiah Jesus will not be ignored by God. However, Paul </p>
<p>always laid the emphasis in human interaction on non-retaliation, benevo-</p>
<p>lence, and generosity towards enemies (Rom 12:19–20).</p>
<p>4. Gaventa 1998: 36.</p>
<p>5. Paul refers to fellow Jesus-believers Andronicus, Junia, Herodion, Lucius, Jason, </p>
<p>and Sosipater as “my kinsmen,” probably recognizing they are fellow Jews (see Rom 16:7, </p>
11, 21). Note also, in Colossians, how Paul makes explicit mention of a few individuals
<p>whom he calls “fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are of the circumcision,” </p>
<p>people who have especially been of comfort to him in his imprisonment (Col 4:10–11). </p>
<p>is should be evidence enough that he still maintained a special bond with Jews, even </p>
<p>though he dedicated his ministry to Gentiles.</p>
