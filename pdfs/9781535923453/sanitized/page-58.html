<p>Fusing the Horizons: Metamorphosis46</p>
<p>But that can make it seem like the Christian life is simply one of glori-</p>
<p>ous transformation, like an unassuming caterpillar becoming a beautiful but-</p>
<p>terﬂy. However, a glorious transformation is not the only kind of change that </p>
<p>believers must undergo. In a sinful, hostile world, there is another kind of </p>
<p>“becoming”—believers sometimes must become something less glorious in </p>
<p>the eyes of the world. When writing to the Corinthians, he told them that he </p>
<p>had to suffer becoming (ginomai) like garbage in the world’s eyes in order to </p>
<p>bring them the gospel (1 Cor 4:13). Sometimes the calling of a Christian is </p>
<p>to transform into something ignoble, shameful; this is the only way Paul can </p>
<p>say: “death is at work in us, but life is at work in you” (2 Cor 4:12). We see </p>
<p>this clearly modeled by Jesus in Phil 2:5–11 where he took upon himself the </p>
<p>humble station of a human who had to face the shame of death on a cross </p>
<p>(2:8). Christ’s own “becoming” was to become a reject (John 1:11).</p>
<p>This may be what Paul means when he says that he became an infant </p>
<p>(see below 54–56) with them (2:7). In this context, it means something that </p>
<p>would not come naturally to Paul. For the sake of the Thessalonians, Paul had </p>
<p>to undergo a change, a metamorphosis, but not always into something more </p>
<p>attractive from a worldly perspective. Yet this becoming is inspired by the </p>
<p>Messiah and empowered by the Spirit. </p>
<p>We would do well to remember, then, that God intends to change us. </p>
<p>Obviously he wants to cause us to grow in holiness. But we must also con-</p>
<p>sider other ways we might need to go through a metamorphosis in order </p>
<p>to bring goodness and blessing to someone else. Perhaps that change will </p>
<p>not seem “glorious,” but if it beneﬁts and blesses the other, it will bespeak </p>
<p>Christlikeness.</p>
<p>In 1:6 we learn for the rst time in the letter that the essalonians </p>
<p>faced bitter persecution when they accepted the good news. ey did not </p>
<p>shrink from faith, nor did they retaliate against any trouble-makers, but </p>
<p>met the occasion with joy, the same kind of godly reaction that was seen </p>
<p>in the suering apostles, the prophets, and even the Lord Jesus himself (1 </p>
<p>ess 2:14–15). e essalonians became the poster-children of what </p>
<p>Paul would commend years later to the Romans: those who “Rejoice in </p>
<p>hope, endure in suering, persist in prayer” (12:12 NET). So noteworthy </p>
<p>was their surrender and commitment to Jesus and his kingdom that their </p>
