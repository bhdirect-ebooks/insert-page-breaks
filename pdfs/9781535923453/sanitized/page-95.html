<p>Exhortation to Persevere and Grow in Holiness, Love, and Integrity 83</p>
<p>being disconnected from the one true God (hence the life-transforming </p>
<p>conversion of the essalonians in 1:9–10). e Jewish philosopher Philo </p>
<p>(roughly a contemporary to Paul) made this statement about the dierence </p>
<p>between Jews and Gentiles:</p>
<p>And there are some of the Gentiles, who, not attending to the hon-</p>
<p>or due to the one God alone, deserve to be punished with extreme </p>
<p>severity of punishment, as having forsaken the most important </p>
<p>classication of piety and holiness, and as having chosen darkness </p>
<p>in preference to the most brilliant light, and having rendered their </p>
<p>own intellect blind when it might have seen clearly (Special Laws </p>
<p>1.54). </p>
<p>is is, more or less, what Paul expresses in Rom 1:18–32: when people </p>
<p>reject the one God, it is as if they choose to live in darkness—ignorance of </p>
<p>(the one, true) God is ignorance of life itself (Rom 1:21). But Paul’s point is </p>
<p>precisely that the essalonians are not in darkness (1 ess 5:4) like their </p>
<p>neighbors (or even their pre-Christian selves). ey are people of the day </p>
<p>who are, or certainly can be, at their full wits to live holy and upright lives </p>
<p>(1 ess 5:8; cf. Rom 13:12).</p>
<p>While there are obviously some interpretive conundrums in 1 ess </p>
<p>4:3–5, Paul’s overall concern for sexual purity and holiness is clear. How-</p>
<p>ever, when we transition to 4:6, we are at a loss to make sense of what he </p>
<p>means that “each of you must not trespass and cheat his brother in this </p>
<p>matter.” What is “this matter”? Probably the meaning is that, when a man </p>
<p>commits adultery with a married woman, he is violating the boundaries of </p>
<p>that marriage and sinning against his Christian brother (see NLT). We may </p>
<p>gain some insight on these concerns by, again, turning to the situation of </p>
<p>Joseph and Potiphar’s wife according to Josephus’ retelling (Ant. 2; cf. Gen </p>
<p>49). Josephus explains Joseph’s righteous refusal of Potiphar’s wife in this </p>
<p>way:</p>
<p>She made known her naughty inclinations, and spoke to him about </p>
<p>lying with her. However, he rejected her entreaties, not thinking it </p>
<p>agreeable to religion to yield so far to her, as to do what would </p>
<p>tend to the aront and injury of him that purchased him, and had </p>
<p>vouchsafed him so great honours (Ant. 2.42). </p>
<p>While Joseph shows concern for proper holiness (“religion”; hosios), </p>
<p>he demonstrates particular respect for Potiphar himself. He would never </p>
<p>do anything, no matter how tempting, to damage and mistreat Potiphar. </p>
<p>is is an apt analogy for what Paul is concerned with. It is improper for </p>
