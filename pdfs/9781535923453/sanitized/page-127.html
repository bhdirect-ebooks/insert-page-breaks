being formed by God. e divine will is set upon guiding believers towards
<p>completeness and maturity in holiness. Perhaps for some essalonians, </p>
<p>their concern was set on information—what happened in our community? </p>
<p>What will happen next? How can I be spared? How can I appease an angry </p>
<p>god? But according to Paul, their concern should be set on formation—how </p>
<p>can I grow in holiness and obedience to God? How can I bring wholeness </p>
<p>to my entire self? How can I ensure that I have nothing to hide when Jesus </p>
<p>returns? But even in the area of formation, Paul assures the essalonians </p>
<p>that this is not an area where believers should be driven by fear. God will </p>
<p>see this through, he is both powerful enough and faithful to his promises.</p>
<p>One item of scholarly interest should be noted here. In this text, Paul </p>
<p>refers to the essalonian in view of “spirit, soul, and body” (5:23), namely </p>
<p>that these should be preserved at the Parousia. eologians have been fas-</p>
<p>cinated with this description of the nature of the person, and debate has </p>
<p>ensued over exactly what is meant by this triple designation. Ambrose is a </p>
<p>good example of a “trichotomist” who viewed the person as a “mixture” of </p>
<p>three separate components: </p>
We are a composite of diverse elements mixed together, cold
<p>with hot, and moist with dry. is mixture is the source of many </p>
<p>pleasures and manifold delights of the esh. But these are not the </p>
<p>rst fruits of this body of ours. Since we are composed of soul and </p>
<p>body and spirit, the rst place is held by that mixture in which the </p>
<p>apostle desires that we nd sanctication.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ere are several problems with a tripartite view of the person, not </p>
<p>least of which is that the mention of all three items (body, soul, spirit) is </p>
<p>found only in this one verse in all of Paul, and, indeed, in all of the Bible.</p>

<p>N. T. Wright has recently summarized a helpful re-thinking of how to ap-</p>
<p>proach Paul’s anthropological language. He writes, </p>
<p>ese words sometimes appear to designate dierent “parts” of a </p>
<p>human being, but, as many have pointed out, it is better to see </p>
<p>them as each encoding a particular way of looking at the human </p>
<p>being as a whole but from one particular angle. . . . Each of these </p>
<p>aspects means what it means because of all the others; but one </p>
<p>would use dierent language to draw attention to these dierent </p>
