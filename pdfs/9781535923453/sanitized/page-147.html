<p>Perseverance and Hope (2 ess 2:1–17) 135</p>
<p>temple” of the Church)? Given the metaphor-laden nature of this entire </p>
<p>section (2:3–12), we should be wary of pressing for too many details. Paul </p>
<p>is not trying to work out the specics for the essalonians, but to inform </p>
them of a great dividing line between the wicked and the righteous, and
<p>that there will be a great rebellion where the Lawless One will try to de-</p>
<p>throne God himself.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>In 2:5, Paul, with some frustration it would seem, reminds the es-</p>
<p>salonians that he had taught them these things in person previously.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Apparently, he informed them regarding what was “now restraining” the </p>
<p>Lawless One. Again, Paul writes in cryptic language; in 2:5 the restrainer </p>
<p>is a “what” (neuter), but in 2:6 the restrainer is a “who” (masculine). And, </p>
<p>again, there is almost no end to the speculation regarding the identity of </p>
<p>this gure or force. e most common interpretations are these:</p>
<p>Restrainer as Roman Empire.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>is interpretation argues that Paul</p>
<p>would have had a positive view of Rome such that he could see the </p>
<p>Roman empire as establishing order in such a way as to prevent </p>
<p>the Lawless One from taking power.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>A related view is that Paul</p>
<p>appeals not to Rome alone, but the orderliness of governance in </p>
<p>general, with Rome as the present one; so one commentator ex-</p>
<p>plains that the restrainer could be “the principle of law and order, </p>
<p>of which Roman rule was but one instance and of which there have </p>
<p>been many others.”</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Restrainer as Paul.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>A few scholars have tried to make the case</p>
<p>that the Restrainer is Paul himself and the restraining power is his </p>

<p>18. Weima: “eschatological matters were of such importance to the apostle that </p>
<p>they were at the core of his gospel presentation [see 1 ess 1:9–10] and also, in light </p>
<p>of the weightiness of the subject, were frequently the subject matter of Paul’s preaching” </p>
<p>(Weima 2014: 524); also Dunn 1998: 302–3.</p>
<p>19. See Bruce 1982: 188; Richard 1995: 338–39; so John Wesley’s Explanatory note: </p>
<p>“e power of the Roman emperors”; according to Wesley, what keeps the “son of perdi-</p>
<p>tion” at bay is the successive “potentate” coming aer Rome, i.e., “the emperors, heathen </p>
<p>or Christian; the kings, Goths or Lombards; the Carolingian or German emperors” (see </p>
<p>note 2:7).</p>
<p>20. Earl Richard observes that Jewish texts like Wisdom of Solomon 6.1–4 could </p>
<p>attest that some Jews believed that God entrusted pagan rulers with their authority and </p>
<p>could bless their governance as long as they ruled justly; see Richard 1995: 339.</p>
