<p>Excursus : Was the Church of the essalonians a Male-Only Guild? 9</p>
<p>wise.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>We ought to be careful not to narrow Paul’s language of siblingship to</p>
<p>men only. There is ample evidence from Paul’s letters that the term adelphoi </p>
<p>(lit. “brothers”) is inclusive of women as well (hence NRSV: “brothers and </p>
<p>sisters”).</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>Just because speciﬁc women are not named does not mean they</p>
<p>are not there. </p>
<p>Why Did Paul Write 1 essalonians?</p>
<p>Paul was not a “writer” in the sense that he did it as a hobby, or even vo-</p>
<p>cationally. He wrote to communicate, but he much preferred being face to </p>
<p>face (1 ess 2:17; 3:10). In that sense, he echoes the sentiment of 2 John </p>
<p>1:12: “Although I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper </p>
<p>and ink; instead I hope to come to you and talk with you face to face, so that </p>
<p>our joy may be complete.” He was an apostle with a mission and message, </p>
<p>but clearly he was like a pastor, wanting to guide his own ock; or like a </p>
<p>mother wanting to care for her children (1 ess 2:7). Paul did not typically </p>
<p>write letters to update his churches on his situation or simply to check in </p>
<p>on them. His tendency was to write as a form of problem-solving, whether </p>
<p>to correct, pacify, comfort, encourage, etc. It behooves us to ask, then, why </p>
<p>did Paul write 1 essalonians? </p>
<p>Again, the challenge in answering this question is that the only real </p>
<p>evidence we have (aside from some of the information listed above related </p>
<p>to Acts 16–17) must come from guesswork based on the letter of 1 es-</p>
<p>salonians itself. Howard Marshall underscores the diculty with this il-</p>
<p>lustration: “It is rather like the problem of trying to form a picture of a </p>
<p>modern church simply on the basis of the ocial minutes of its business </p>
<p>meeting; we should know very little about what actually happened in its </p>
<p>services and other activities or about the kind of people who made up the </p>
<p>congregation.”</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we ought to learn what we can and be able</p>
<p>to distinguish what is certain from what is probable, and then also consider </p>
<p>what is plausible.</p>
