<p>Introduction 35</p>
<p>16:21 where Paul also announces, “I, Paul, write this greeting with my own </p>
<p>hand.” How did the pseudepigrapher come to have 1 Corinthians in his </p>
<p>possession, and then what would possess him to write a pseudonymous </p>
<p>letter to the essalonians? If he had a collection of Pauline letters, he would </p>
<p>be writing in the second century or later. Aside from the question about </p>
<p>why he would write a letter with such specic details to essalonica (deal-</p>
<p>ing with issues that would have related to the community in the middle </p>
<p>of the rst century), there is also the matter of why the pseudepigrapher </p>
<p>would make the claim that this is how Paul writes in all his letters (2 ess </p>
<p>3:17), when knowledge of a wider collection would not demonstrate this.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>e last area of “theological dierences” is also not a serious obstacle </p>
<p>in view of authenticity. Only a simplistic view of Paul’s theology and how he </p>
<p>engages in nuanced ways with churches dealing with various problems can </p>
<p>eliminate Paul from the equation of the authorship of 2 essalonians. Leon </p>
<p>Morris points out that it is rather common for writers with an apocalyptic </p>
<p>worldview to “hold to the two ideas of suddenness and the appearance of </p>
<p>preparatory signs.”</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> John Barclay perhaps says it best:</p>
<p>Apocalypticists are notoriously slippery characters. Many apoca-</p>
<p>lyptic works present conicting scenarios of the end and inconsis-</p>
<p>tent theses concerning signs of its imminence. at Paul should </p>
<p>write both of these apocalyptic passages, and do so within a short </p>
<p>space of time, is by no means impossible; why should his apoca-</p>
<p>lyptic statements be any more consistent than his varied remarks </p>
<p>about the law?</p>

<p>98. Paul mentions writing by hand in Gal 6:11, 1 Cor 16:21, Col 4:18, and Phlm 19. </p>
<p>Otherwise, in letters like Romans and 2 Corinthians he says no such thing (nor in 1 </p>
<p>essalonians). It could be that he wrote in nal words in his own handwriting in the </p>
<p>original documents – and the rst readers would be able to notice this. But by the time a </p>
<p>pseudepigrapher got a handle on a set of Pauline texts, they would have been copies, thus </p>
<p>he would not have knowledge of this practice of Paul if it was typical of his letter writing. </p>

<p>99. Morris 1975: 21. Furthermore, F. F. Bruce urges that the same soon/not-yet </p>
<p>dynamic is indicative of Jesus’ eschatological teaching in the Synoptics (Bruce 1982: </p>
<p>xlii–xliii).</p>
