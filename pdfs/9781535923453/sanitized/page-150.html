<p>Perseverance and Hope (2 ess 2:1–17)138</p>
<p>chapter eleven. In Isaiah’s vision of the peaceful kingdom, he refers to a </p>
<p>shoot from the stump of Jesse (the Davidic messiah) who will have the </p>
<p>spirit of the Lord (11:1–2). He will be a just judge and will take up the cause </p>
<p>of the needy.</p>
<p>With righteousness he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity </p>
<p>for the meek of the earth; he shall strike the earth with the rod of </p>
<p>his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked </p>
<p>(Isa 11:4) </p>
<p>In the Jewish apocalyptic text 4 Ezra, we read about the messiah who </p>
<p>defeats a great multitude of enemies: “When he saw the onrush of the </p>
<p>approaching multitude, he neither lied his hand or held a spear or any </p>
<p>weapon of war; but I saw only how he sent forth from his mouth something </p>
<p>like a stream of re, and from his lips a aming breath, and from his tongue </p>
<p>he shot forth a storm of sparks” (4 Ezra 13:9–10).</p>
<p>When it comes to 2 ess 2:8, the important thing to note here is that, </p>
<p>as with the imagery of 4 Ezra, there is no battle. ere is no moment when it </p>
<p>looks like Jesus might lose. He appears in glory and power and vanquishes </p>
<p>the Lawless One eortlessly.</p>
<p>In some ways, 2:9–11 is a digression—Paul stops the clock and goes </p>
<p>back to zoom in on the events surrounding the coming of the Lawless One </p>
<p>(though he clearly wanted to insure that he established the certain downfall </p>
<p>of the Lawless One as a matter of rst importance in his discussion). e </p>
<p>Lawless One is associated with the work of Satan. Paul elsewhere depicts </p>
<p>Satan as the arch-tempter and deceiver (1 Cor 7:5; 2 Cor 2:11; 11:14; 12:7), </p>
<p>the ultimate opponent of God (1 ess 2:18; Rom 16:20; cf. 1 Tim 5:15). </p>
<p>Apparently Satan will empower the Lawless One to perform all manner of </p>
<p>false “signs and wonders” (sēmeiois kai terasin). Signs and wonders were </p>
<p>meant to be proof of someone’s legitimacy (see Deut 13:1–3). Note that </p>
<p>when Peter preaches to the men of Israel, he comments that Jesus was en-</p>
<p>dorsed or accredited by God via his miracles, wonders, and signs (Acts </p>
<p>2:22, see NIV “accredited”; CEB “credentials”; cf. Acts 15:12). Paul himself </p>
<p>performed signs and wonders, no doubt to authenticate his own ministry </p>
<p>(Rom 15:19; 2 Cor 12:12).</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>By referring to these so-called “signs and wonders” of the Lawless </p>
<p>One as “false” (pseudos), Paul was not implying that they were mere par-</p>
<p>lor tricks. It is not as if the Lawless One will be pretending to do miracles; </p>
<p>31. For a helpful discussion of this, see Twelree 2013.</p>
