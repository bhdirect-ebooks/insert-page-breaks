<p>Fusing the Horizons: Life Together 75</p>
<p>Paul explains in Philippians, two people who share one soul and heartbeat </p>
<p>(see Phil 1:27; 2:2). Christian fellowship and unity are not about agreement </p>
<p>and encouragement—though such things are obviously important. Christian </p>
<p>fellowship can begin with an hour at church, but must be deﬁned by, to borrow </p>
<p>a phrase from the German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, “life together.”</p>
<p>Bonhoeffer wrote the book Life Together to capture a proper Christian </p>
<p>vision of fellowship. In this book, he reminds us that one reason why we </p>
<p>have such a hard time understanding how Paul felt about the Thessalonians </p>
<p>is because we are often spoiled by too many opportunities to know and have </p>
<p>friendship and companionship with other believers. But there have been times </p>
<p>and places in history where Christians have not had that luxury – even places </p>
<p>around the world today. Here is what Bonhoeffer writes:</p>
<p>It is by God’s grace that a congregation is permitted to gather </p>
<p>visibly around God’s word and sacrament in this world. Not all </p>
<p>Christians partake of this grace. The imprisoned, the sick, the </p>
<p>lonely who live in the diaspora, the proclaimers of the gospel in </p>
<p>heathen lands stand alone. They know that visible community is </p>
<p>grace.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bonhoeffer ponders why community is so important, and concludes that </p>
<p>it is because we are human.</p>
<p>A human being is created as a body; the Son of God appeared </p>
<p>on earth in the body for our sake and was raised in the body. In </p>
<p>the sacrament the believer receives the Lord Christ in the body, </p>
<p>and the resurrection of the dead will bring about the perfected </p>
<p>community of God’s spiritual-physical creatures. Therefore, the </p>
<p>believer praises the Creator, the Reconciler and the Redeemer, </p>
<p>God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, for the bodily presence of the </p>
<p>other Christian. The prisoner, the sick person, the Christian living </p>
<p>in the diaspora recognizes in the nearness of a fellow Christian a </p>
<p>physical sign of the gracious presence of the triune God. In their </p>
<p>loneliness, both the visitor and the one visited recognize in each </p>
<p>other the Christ who is present in the body. They receive and meet </p>
<p>each other as one meets the Lord, in reverence, humility, and joy. </p>
<p>They receive each other’s blessings as the blessing of the Lord </p>
<p>Jesus Christ. But if there is so much happiness and joy even in a </p>
<p>single encounter of one Christian with another, what inexhaustible </p>
