<p>Excursus: Eternal Destruction (2 ess 1:9)?126</p>
<p>of references to hell do not build a complete picture: “We know much more </p>
<p>about heaven than hell, for heaven is the home of humanity and therefore </p>
<p>contains all that is implied in a gloriﬁed human life: but hell was not made </p>
<p>for men. It is in no sense parallel to heaven: it is ‘the darkness outside,’ the </p>
<p>outer rim where being fades away into nonentity.”</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Gordon Fee interprets</p>
<p>Paul likewise: “Paul had little or no interest in ‘hell’ as such. For him eternal </p>
<p>glory has to do with being in the presence of the Father and the risen Lord. </p>
<p>The eternal judgment of the wicked is the absolute loss of such glory.”</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Paul’s concern as he rounds out this section (2 ess 1:5–10) is that </p>
<p>the essalonians who are suering shame will experience vindication </p>
<p>along with the risen Messiah Jesus when he comes to be honored at last </p>
<p>and even to inspire wonder when he is gloried for all to see (1:10). Paul </p>
<p>points to the co-glorication of believers—those who have been willing, in </p>
<p>this time now of trial, to trust in the Lord who is invisible, but will nally </p>
<p>be revealed. What Paul says here is echoed elsewhere in the New Testament </p>
<p>in 1 Peter 1:8, “Although you have not seen him, you love him; and even </p>
<p>though you do not see him now, you believe in him and rejoice with an </p>
<p>indescribable and glorious joy, for you are receiving the outcome of your </p>
<p>faith, the salvation of your souls.”</p>
<p>Prayer for Vocation, Obedience, and Honor (1:11–12)</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>With this is mind we always pray for you, that our God would </p>
<p>make you worthy of his calling, and that he would bring to fruition </p>
<p>by his power every desire to be generous and every act of loyalty. </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>en the name of our Lord Jesus will be gloried because of </p>
<p>you, and you will be gloried because of him, according to the </p>
<p>grace of our God and the Lord Messiah Jesus. </p>
<p>Paul concludes the rst chapter of his letter with a wish-prayer, giving at-</p>
<p>tention to their calling and faith, and also the sure hope that Jesus will be </p>
<p>gloried in their midst. We should be reminded here of the relationship </p>
<p>18. Lewis 1996: 129; there are striking similarities between Lewis here and the </p>
<p>words of eodore of Mopsuestia: “the punishment of those wicked who have died is </p>
<p>completed in a reality that transcends time itself and is forever” (See Gorday 2000: 105).</p>
