<p>e Hopeful Fate of the Christian Dead (1 ess 4:13–18) 93</p>
<p>more lighthearted tone, we might note this inscription also: “Friends who </p>
<p>read this, listen to my advice: mix wine, tie the garlands around your head, </p>
<p>drink deep. And do not deny pretty girls the sweets of love. When death </p>
<p>comes, earth and re consume everything.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Let us now spend time examining closely the statement of comfort </p>
<p>Paul oers in 4:15–17. First, we should note what Paul does not do here. His </p>
<p>concern is that he wishes to encourage the essalonians who are le alive </p>
<p>in light of the recent death of fellow believers of their community. I would </p>
<p>imagine that if a similar situation happened today, I might hear a pastor or </p>
<p>priest say (for example, at a funeral), “Charlie is gone from this world, but </p>
<p>take comfort, because he is in heaven with Jesus and the angels enjoying </p>
<p>eternal peace and rest.” No doubt Paul had a sense for the “silver lining” of </p>
<p>death sending one somehow into the immediate realm of the Messiah (see </p>
<p>Phil 1:23); but for the early Christians, they placed the weight of their hope </p>
<p>on the “Day of the Messiah” (so Phil 1:10; 2:16; cf. 1 Cor 15:23; 2 ess 2:8; </p>
<p>2 Peter 3:12–13). So even in 1 ess 4:15–17, Paul does not tell the essa-</p>
<p>lonians—the dead in the Messiah are at peace with God in heaven. However </p>
<p>he understood their present existence, it was more important that he tell </p>
<p>them about what lies ahead. And he does so with such fantastic images, </p>
<p>like something out of a science ction novel. But as unusual as his language </p>
<p>is for our daily, chastened religious vocabulary, it was rather common for </p>
<p>Jews like Paul who had an “apocalyptic imagination.”</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> is kind of think-</p>
<p>ing carried the expectation that the God of Israel was a God who would </p>
<p>not let human sin and the power of evil consume the world He created. </p>
<p>An apocalyptic mindset expected God to break into time and space in a </p>
<p>radically powerful way to reset the balance of power and restore all that had </p>
<p>(re)turned to chaos. So, Isaiah 63 reects on the problem of Israel (in exile) </p>
<p>suering under foreign oppression—where is God? e whole chapter re-</p>
<p>counts a sad tale of Israel sinning, being punished by God, Israel crying out </p>
<p>in pain (because of the mess they caused for themselves), and God coming </p>
<p>to their aid. Life in exile seemed to be the end of the road, a place of ut-</p>
<p>ter hopelessness (see Isa 63:17). e lament comes to a climax with Israel </p>
<p>pleading with her God, enjoining Him to “burst forth from the heavens and </p>
<p>come down, so that the mountains would quake at your presence” (64:1). </p>
<p>in some kind of post-mortem existence, but it seems to be that there was no clear idea of </p>
<p>what that existence would look like, or whether it was consciously happy or not. </p>
