<p>Excursus: Gentle or Infants? (2:7b)</p>
<p>The reason why we have the question regarding what Paul meant in 1 Thess </p>
<p>2:7 is that some Greek manuscripts show the reading “infants” (n</p>
<p>ē</p>
<p>pioi) and </p>
<p>others “gentle” (</p>
<p>ē</p>
<p>pioi). The difference between these words is a single Greek </p>
<p>letter—nu (an “n” consonantal sound) at the beginning of the word. When </p>
<p>Greek manuscripts differ on the wording of a text, theories are devised to </p>
<p>determine which word (n</p>
<p>ē</p>
<p>pioi or </p>
<p>ē</p>
<p>poioi) was the original one that Paul wrote. </p>
<p>Such theories rely on two kinds of evidence: external (based on the quality and </p>
<p>dating of extant manuscripts) and internal (based on how one reads the text). </p>
<p>From an external standpoint, virtually all scholars agree that the manuscript </p>
<p>witnesses for the n</p>
<p>ē</p>
<p>pioi (“infants”) reading are stronger.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>However, many</p>
<p>scholars ﬁnd internal evidence persuasive enough to encourage adopting the </p>
<p>ē</p>
<p>pioi (“gentle”) variant as original.</p>
<p>Howard Marshall, for example, prefers </p>
<p>ē</p>
<p>pioi (“gentle”) on the grounds </p>
<p>that it would appear that a rarely-used word (</p>
<p>ē</p>
<p>pioi) was swapped out by a tex-</p>
<p>tual scribe for a more common word (n</p>
<p>ē</p>
<p>pioi).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Most commentators that adopt</p>
<p>the </p>
<p>ē</p>
<p>pioi reading do so, though, primarily because it ﬁts well into the ﬂow of </p>
<p>Paul’s argumentation—Paul could have come on strong in authority with the </p>
<p>Thessalonians, but chose to be gentle. The </p>
<p>ē</p>
<p>pioi proponents also argue that a </p>
<p>n</p>
<p>ē</p>
<p>pioi reading would be very confusing as Paul would be mixing metaphors: </p>
<p>Paul was like an infant, like a nursing mother (2:7). Does it make sense for </p>
<p>Paul to link together these two metaphors in this way?</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>In defense of the n</p>
<p>ē</p>
<p>pioi reading, Charles Cousar appeals to a guiding </p>
<p>principle of textual criticism called lectio difﬁcilior—in general, the reading </p>
<p>that makes the text more difﬁcult to understand is probably the original read-</p>
<p>ing. Another way to put this principle is that it is far more likely that a scribe </p>
<p>9. Gordon Fee states this quite starkly: “e external evidence is decisively in fa-</p>
<p>vor of nēpioi, being supported by the earliest evidence in the West (all the Old Latin) </p>
<p>and in the East (∏</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>), as well as by the predominance of what is most oen considered </p>
<p>the best evidence (in this case, all but Codex A of the Egyptian witnesses). One would </p>
<p>seem to need especially strong transcriptional arguments to overrule this combination </p>
<p>of evidence. In fact, the evidence for ēpioi is so much weaker than for nēpioi that under </p>
<p>ordinary circumstances no living scholar would accept the former reading as original, </p>
<p>which is what makes the note in the NRSV so misleading: ‘Other ancient authorities read </p>
<p>infants.’ at note levels the ground on a textual decision that is decidedly not level, not </p>
<p>even close” (Fee 2009: 70).</p>
