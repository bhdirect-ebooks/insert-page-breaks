<p>Living the Christian Life</p>
<p>155</p>
<p>many have noted controversy in Rome over particular taxes at about this </p>
<p>point in Nero’s reign, controversy that would surely have been known in </p>
<p>Corinth where Paul wrote.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Church and State</p>
<p>Paul depicts relations with the state within a particular kind of situation. </p>
<p>What happens, however, when a state, far from avenging wrongdoing, is itself </p>
<p>the persecutor? Paul wrote early in Nero’s reign, before he began persecuting </p>
<p>Christians.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as a Jew who had faced Roman rods (2 Cor 11:25)</p>
<p>and lived in Judea, Paul was well aware that the empire already oppressed </p>
<p>peoples and that injustices often occurred under its auspices. Injustice </p>
<p>notwithstanding, he does not side with the Judean nationalist ethos already </p>
<p>building when he was writing (cf. Rom 15:31), which would soon climax in </p>
<p>open war with Rome.</p>
<p>15</p>
Many historically used this passage (among others) to support the divine
<p>right of kings.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>But if Paul follows Jesus’s teaching on giving to Caesar what</p>
<p>is Caesar’s (13:6–7; Mark 12:17),</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> he presumably also agreed with his ca-</p>
<p>veat that some things belonged only to God (Mark 12:17). For example, Paul </p>
<p>surely would not, out of allegiance to the state, sanction participation in the </p>
<p>popular imperial cult (cf. 1 Cor 10:20–21). Further, submission was a tempo-</p>
<p>rary expedient; Paul did not expect Rome or other worldly empires to continue </p>
<p>13. See the varying interpretations of Tacitus Ann. 13.50–51 in Dunn 1988: 766; </p>
<p>Tobin 2004: 399–400; Jewett 2007: 798–99, though it is hard to be certain; even early </p>
<p>interpreters diered regarding which taxes Paul intended (Bray 1998: 329). Haacker </p>
<p>(2003: 121 n. 19) suggests that Paul says “you” (excluding himself) here because he was a </p>
<p>Roman citizen (though Paul says “you” frequently in this context).</p>
<p>14. e early Nero, under Seneca’s inuence, behaved better (see Grin 1984: </p>
<p>50–82).</p>
<p>15. Some early Christian writers thought Jewish nationalism Paul’s target here </p>
<p>(Apollinaris of Laodicea Pauline Commentary from the Greek Church on Rom 13:1–7; </p>
<p>Bray 1998: 324), though Jews in Rome were probably mostly immune to it.</p>
<p>16. For its treatment through history, see concisely Reasoner 2005: 130–36; Bray </p>
<p>1998: 323–26. Luther’s approach may have been unconsciously co-opted by his political </p>
<p>patrons, not unlike the co-opting of the religious right and le by political patrons in </p>
<p>recent U.S. history.</p>
<p>17. Jewish sources that emphasize allegiance to the state also oer this qualication </p>
<p>(Tobin 2004: 397–99; see esp. Josephus Ant. 18.266–68; idem J . W. 2.197; idem Ag. Ap. </p>
<p>2.76–77); philosophic treatises on kingship also qualied royal authority.</p>
