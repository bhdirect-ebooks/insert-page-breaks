<p>Romans 6:12–23</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>they embraced in conversion expressed in baptism (6:3–4). “Obeying” </p>
<p>that teaching meant that they had le their past way of life, in which they </p>
<p>used whatever freedom they had to serve their own interests, and now </p>
<p>recognized a new lord and master over their lives, namely Christ (cf. 6:23; </p>
<p>10:9–10; 14:8–9).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Paul admits that his depiction of the rule of sin and righteousness </p>
<p>in terms of slavery is merely a human analogy (6:19a),</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> but it is, never-</p>
<p>theless, a very intelligible one for his audience. A former slave of a bad </p>
<p>master would not want to return to that master; in the same way, no sen-</p>
<p>sible person would want to return to a lifestyle the fruit</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>of which was</p>
<p>death (6:21). Paul has already established that sin brought death just as </p>
<p>Christ’s obedience inaugurated righteousness (5:12–21). Why then would </p>
<p>someone choose sin when they have the choice to embrace life? In 6:23 </p>
<p>Paul shis or reverts to an economic metaphor: household slaves oen on </p>
<p>the side earned some “wages” (though this term is oen a military one). </p>
<p>Wages were not a matter of grace, but of what one deserved (4:4, though </p>
<p>using a dierent term). Sin merited death, but God’s free gi (charisma, </p>
<p>5:15–16) in Christ was eternal life, the life of the resurrection (cf. Dan </p>
<p>12:2).</p>
<p>16. is diers from the common emphasis on self-mastery (e.g., Epictetus Disc. </p>
<p>1.11.37; 4 Macc 13:1), but thinkers could speak of being slaves of philosophy (Seneca Ep. </p>
<p>Lucil. 8.7) or of God (Philo Cherubim 107).</p>
17. Later rabbis argued that Scripture used “ordinary language” to convey divine truth
<p>(Sipra Qed. par. 4.206.1.1) and sometimes noted that they were using human analogies </p>
<p>(Song Rab. 1:1, §10; Johnston 1977: 519–20).</p>
<p>18. “Benet” (nasb; tniv) or “advantage” (nrsv) here is karpos, also meaning “fruit” </p>
<p>or “product” (or “prot”; Musonius Rufus 14, p. 92.23). Paul will soon associate the law </p>
<p>even with arousing passions bearing fruit for death (7:5). e natural product of the </p>
<p>Spirit’s activity is very dierent (Gal 5:22–23). In an economic context, karpos also meant </p>
<p>“prot” or “gain” (hence ows naturally into “wages” in Rom 6:23).</p>
