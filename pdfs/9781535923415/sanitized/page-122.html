<p>Excursus: e “Flesh” (sarx) in Romans</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>translations (such as the n i v ) even poorly translate sarx simply as “sinful na-</p>
<p>ture” (which for some Christian traditions also evokes a dualism of two natures </p>
<p>struggling within the believer).</p>
<p>Paul certainly believes that the body can be used for good (12:1)—but </p>
<p>also for evil (6:13). The body as such is not evil, but if the body’s desires </p>
<p>rather than God’s Spirit dominates one’s existence, one readily comes into </p>
<p>the power of sin.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>Paul speaks of the “passions” (1:24; 6:12; 13:14) and</p>
<p>“desiring” what is not one’s own (7:7–8; 13:9). Impure hearts lead to deﬁling </p>
<p>bodies sexually (1:24); the old life in Adam involves the “body of sin” (6:6); </p>
<p>one should avoid obeying the desires of the mortal body (6:12); the existence </p>
<p>of moral defeat is characterized by the “body of death” (7:24; cf. 8:10–13).</p>
<p>Paul connects the term “ﬂesh” with the body. Ultimately this is not an </p>
<p>anthropological dualism between two parts within a person (in 7:23, the mind </p>
<p>remains subject to the ﬂesh), but humanity as sarx contrasted with God’s </p>
<p>Spirit (8:4–9; Gen 6:3).</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>The o t employed the equivalent Hebrew term basar</p>
<p>for humans (or other animals) in their limited creatureliness, including their </p>
<p>mortality.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>By Paul’s day, some Jews employed the term for human weakness</p>
<p>in its susceptibility to sin.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>Basar and its Greek translation sarx were not</p>
<p>inherently evil, but as “human weakness” were susceptible to sin. Flesh was </p>
<p>not meant to lead human life, but to be the arena in which life should be lived </p>
<p>in obedience to God. Paul could use “ﬂesh” also for the outward existence </p>
<p>(Rom 1:3; 2:28; 4:1; 9:3, 5, 8; 11:14), again what is merely human (though </p>
<p>not intrinsically evil) rather than empowered by God (he sometimes contrasts </p>
<p>ﬂesh with the Spirit or the promise).</p>
<p>Despite these observations, ﬂesh had an inescapable bodily dimension.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Contrary to the views of a large proportion of n t scholars, mostly following </p>
<p>secondary sources, Diaspora Jews by Paul’s day commonly did distinguish </p>
<p>33. John Chrysostom contends that the problem for Paul is the unregenerate mind’s </p>
<p>abuse of the body (Hom. Cor. 17.1; cf. Hom. Rom. 11).</p>
<p>34. Cf. 1QS 4.21; Flusser 1988: 64–65. For material vs. immaterial, cf. Isa 31:3; 1 En. </p>
<p>106:17.</p>
