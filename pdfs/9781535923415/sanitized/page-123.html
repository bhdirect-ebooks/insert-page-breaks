<p>Excursus: e “Flesh” (sarx) in Romans</p>

<p>soul and body, often expecting immortality for the former even when afﬁrm-</p>
<p>ing resurrection for the latter.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>In 7:5, sinful passions working in the body’s</p>
<p>members characterize being “in the ﬂesh.” In 8:13 one is either destined for </p>
<p>death in the ﬂesh or resurrection by putting to death the body’s deeds. Flesh is </p>
<p>also linked with the body in 6:19; it contrasts with the mind in 7:25; the law </p>
<p>working in one’s bodily members (7:23) is the law of the ﬂesh (7:25).</p>
<p>The conﬂict between the law of sin in the members and the law in the </p>
<p>mind in 7:25 was not the basis for the verdict of “no condemnation” in 8:1, </p>
<p>as if God would overlook physical sin provided one’s mind harbored good mo-</p>
<p>tives. Far from it: 8:1–13 contrasts those who serve the ﬂesh with those who </p>
<p>serve God by the Spirit! Paul’s goal is a way of thinking dominated not by the </p>
<p>ﬂesh (hence by one’s physical desires, which have a legitimate place, but not </p>
<p>in ruling life), but a way of thinking dominated by the Spirit (8:5–9). This new </p>
<p>way of thinking involves a renewed mind (12:2). This renewed mind teaches </p>
<p>believers how to present their bodies in the service of the larger body—the </p>
<p>body of Christ (12:1, 4–5). Such a mind is no longer self-centered, but Christ-</p>
<p>centered; no longer seeking full autonomy, it now submits gladly to the greater </p>
<p>good of God’s purposes. “Flesh” is the localized self in contrast both to depen-</p>
<p>dence on God (through the Spirit) and the corporate interests of Christ’s body. </p>
<p>Life ruled by the ﬂesh is, at root, human selﬁshness and self-centeredness (or </p>
<p>sometimes centered in one’s group), rather than genuinely altruistically shar-</p>
<p>ing God’s interests. Paul’s goal is not to annihilate self, as in some religions, </p>
<p>but to connect it to the service of a greater purpose (cf. 12:1–8; Matt 6:33). </p>
Paul was no gnostic, but neither was he a hedonistic Western individualist
<p>who keeps religion in its subjective place.</p>

<p>1976. Even some later rabbis distinguished the heavenly soul and earthly body (Sipre </p>
<p>Deut. 306.28.2).</p>
