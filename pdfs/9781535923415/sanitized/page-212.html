<p>Romans 16:3–16</p>

<p>include barely enough room to sleep. Rome’s structures were notoriously </p>
<p>unstable and ammable, worse near the top; much of this housing per-</p>
<p>ished in the re of 64 CE a few years later.)</p>
<p>Even if this family did use a house (as they may have in Ephesus; </p>
<p>1 Cor 16:19), it is noteworthy that this label is not applied to the other </p>
<p>congregations implied in this chapter. Possibly guests could also be ac-</p>
<p>commodated in the long hall connecting apartments on upper oors, </p>
<p>if neighbors proved amenable. Because ground oor rooms were oen </p>
<p>businesses with small mezzanine apartments for sleeping above the work </p>
<p>area, some have suggested that the church may have met in such a place </p>
<p>(cf. Acts 18:3).</p>
<p>As “rstfruits” of the Roman province of Asia, Epaenetus (a Greek </p>
<p>name, 16:5) was probably converted through Paul’s early Ephesian minis-</p>
<p>try (Acts 18:19—19:41). Romans had a name like “Mary” (literally Maria, </p>
<p>16:5), but it is also a frequent variant (including in every other usage in </p>
<p>the nt) of “Miriam,” by far the most common name of Jewish women (es-</p>
<p>pecially in Palestine). Like Persis in 16:12, Mary “labored much” (16:6); </p>
<p>the context and “for you” suggest spiritual labor, as in Paul’s own minis-</p>
<p>try (1 Cor 15:10; Gal 4:11; Phil 2:16; Col 1:29) and that of others (1 Cor </p>
<p>16:16; 1 ess 5:12).</p>
<p>Andronicus and Junia seem to be a husband-wife apostolic team </p>
<p>(16:7; brother-sister is less likely, and anything else would have been </p>
<p>scandalous). “Junia” is plainly a woman’s name, as ancient commentators </p>
<p>commonly recognized (and oen found surprising).</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>It is grammatically</p>
<p>possible to read “of note among the apostles” as being honored by other </p>
<p>apostles,</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>but Paul nowhere else appeals to the opinion of “the apostles” as</p>
<p>a group, so most scholars prefer the other possible grammatical reading, </p>
<p>namely, that Paul calls them “noteworthy apostles.” e larger question is </p>
<p>what Paul means by calling them apostles. Whereas Luke usually reserves </p>
<p>the title for the Twelve, Paul applies the title much more widely (begin-</p>
<p>lates that Rome had “only one private house for every 26 blocks of apartment houses.”</p>
<p>21. E.g., John Chrysostom Hom. Rom. 31.2. e supposed contraction of the male </p>
<p>“Junianus” here is nowhere attested in antiquity and is unlikely, since such contractions </p>
<p>do not occur with Roman names (as this one is); see e.g., Cervin 1994; cf. Schulz 1987. </p>
<p>e attempt to make Junia male (found even in some translations) seems a case of theo-</p>
<p>logical special pleading.</p>
