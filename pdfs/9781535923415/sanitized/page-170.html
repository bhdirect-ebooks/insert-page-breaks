<p>(1:28), the mind under the esh (7:23, 25; 8:5–7).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>“Renewing” the mind</p>
<p>involves recognizing and arming the “newness” already initiated in </p>
<p>Christ (6:4; 7:6), which contrasts with the thinking of this “age” (aiōn; </p>
<p>not merely “world,” as in some translations).</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>One is “transformed” to be</p>
<p>ready to be “conformed” to Jesus’s image (8:29) by identifying not with </p>
<p>this age but with believers’ future hope.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>ose who are in Christ have</p>
<p>died with him to sin and will share his resurrection life (6:4–5; 8:11). ey </p>
<p>must thus view their identity in terms of their eternal destiny rather than </p>
<p>how they are viewed by this age (6:11).</p>
<p>e renewed mind of 12:2 (related to the perspective of the Spirit </p>
<p>in 8:5–7) enables believers to discern (dokimazō) God’s will.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>It does so</p>
<p>by helping them to recognize what is, in Paul’s words, “good, acceptable, </p>
<p>and perfect” in God’s sight.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>at these three adjectives help dene God’s</p>
<p>will, just as three adjectives (one of them the same, “acceptable”) dened </p>
<p>the sacrice of 12:1, suggests that Paul is still addressing the same subject: </p>
<p>God’s will here involves how we devote our bodies to God’s service.</p>
<p>Paul quickly becomes more specic about how this renewed mind </p>
<p>guides believers’ service to God: in 12:3 he elaborates how one should </p>
<p>“think.” Rather than boasting (cf. also 12:16), believers should recognize </p>
<p>that God’s gis are acts of his generosity and not merit (cf. 1 Cor 4:7), and </p>
<p>each should recognize his or her role as part of the larger body, in which </p>

<p>7. Various Jewish writers contrasted the present age with the future one (cf. e.g., 4 </p>
<p>Ezra 7:50, 113; 8:1; 2 Bar. 15:8; t. Ber. 6:21; P e’a h 1:2–3; Sipre Num. 115.5.7; Sipre Deut. </p>
<p>31.4.1; 307.3.2–3; Ferch 1977).</p>
<p>8. Paul’s teaching here is consistent with 2 Cor 3:18, where those who view God’s </p>
<p>glory in Christ are internally “transformed” into his glorious image (in context, in con-</p>
<p>trast to Moses, who was transformed externally). Moses also provides the background </p>
<p>for the verb in Mark 9:2; Matt 17:2 (see Moses 1996), though cf. also the more general </p>
<p>concept of mental transformation (Seneca Ep. Lucil. 94.48).</p>
<p>9. Clearly this does not mean they will always know what God will do (1:10; 15:32), </p>
<p>but they should oen have a sense what they should do (cf. perhaps God’s purposes in </p>
<p>history, 11:34). In 2:18, a Jew who knows the law is supposed to be able to know “God’s </p>
<p>will” and “test” (dokimazō) or discern what is best; in 1:28, Gentiles who refused to “ac-</p>
<p>knowledge” (dokimazō) God were delivered to an adokimos mind.</p>
<p>10. Good was a standard moral criterion (e.g., Musonius Rufus 1, p. 32.22); Stoics </p>
<p>also spoke of cognitively discerning what is good (e.g., Epictetus Disc. 2.24.19; Arius </p>
<p>Didymus Epit. 2.7.5b1, p. 12.13–15) or pleasing (Arius Didymus Epit. 5i, p. 32.25–30; cf. </p>
<p>Wis 9:10); others spoke of thinking on what is good (cf. Phil 4:8; Iamblichus Pyth. Life </p>
<p>5.26).</p>
