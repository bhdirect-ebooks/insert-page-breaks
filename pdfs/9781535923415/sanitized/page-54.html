<p>Excursus: Dikaiosunē in Romans</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>In the Greek version of the OT, the cognate verb dikaioo¯ did not imply </p>
<p>a legal ﬁction, but recognizing one as righteous,</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> including in forensic con-</p>
<p>texts (cf. Gen 44:16; Isa 43:9, 26; Ezek 44:24): judges must not “acquit </p>
<p>the guilty” (Exod 23:7), but must “justify,” i.e., pronounce righteous, the </p>
<p>innocent (Deut 25:1).</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>God himself would punish the guilty but “justify” and</p>
<p>vindicate the righteous (1 Kgs 8:32; 2 Chr 6:23); he himself was “justiﬁed,” </p>
<p>or “shown to be right,” when he pronounced just judgment, even against </p>
<p>the psalmist (Ps 51:4, in Rom 3:4). Thus for God to “justify,” “acquit,” or </p>
<p>“vindicate” someone who was a morally guilty person, as in Rom 4:5, might </p>
<p>shock hearers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, those immersed in Scripture could also understand God </p>
<p>rendering judgment in favor of someone based on his mercy. For example, </p>
<p>God pronounced judgment justly against Israel (Dan 9:7, 14); but they could </p>
<p>entreat him to forgive them according to his “righteousness” (Dan 9:16). God </p>
<p>might punish the guilty, yet ultimately plead their case, “justifying” them to </p>
<p>see his “righteousness” (Mic 7:9). Israel hoped for God’s promise of vindica-</p>
<p>tion someday (Isa 45:25; 50:8; 58:8), <span class="_ _5" />including <span class="_ _0" />through <span class="_ _5" />the <span class="_ _5" />righteous <span class="_ _0" />servant </p>
<p>who would bear their sins (Is 53:11; cf. Rom 4:25).</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>God being “righteous”</p>
<p>meant that he would honor the promise to Abraham, whom he found “faithful” </p>
<p>(Neh 9:8).</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>For Paul, God’s righteousness is incompatible with dependence on mere </p>
<p>human righteousness (Rom 9:30—10:6; Phil 3:9). Divine righteousness is </p>
<p>not a goal to be reached by human effort, but a relational premise that should </p>
<p>dictate the new life of faithfulness to Christ. Often Romans uses the verb </p>
<p>cognate (dikaioo¯ ) for God putting believers right with himself, reinforcing the </p>
<p>possibility that this is how Paul uses the noun here.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>This verb can signify</p>
<p>just vindication; in a forensic context it may entail “justiﬁcation” (as many </p>
<p>46. Gen 38:26; cf. Job 33:32; Sir 1:22; 23:11; 26:29; 31[34]:5; of God in Sir 18:2; used </p>
<p>in a comparative sense in Jer 3:11; Ezek 16:51–52. Cf. 1QS 3.3; Gen. Rab. 65:6.</p>
<p>47. To “justify” was also to “render justice” on someone’s behalf (2 Sam 15:4); one </p>
<p>should “justify,” “vindicate,” “defend the rights of” the widow (Isa 1:17) and the poor (Ps </p>
<p>82:3).</p>
<p>48. In the Greek version of Isa 53:11, it is the servant who is justied.</p>
<p>49. Some other Jews also depended on God’s “righteousness” to vindicate or save </p>
<p>them (1QS 11.5, 9–14; cf. 1QH 4.29–37; 11.10–11; 1QM 11.3–4; Gen. Rab. 33:1; for a </p>
<p>fuller range of biblical (and some early Jewish) background, see e.g., Stuhlmacher 2001: </p>
<p>13–24).</p>
<p>50. Cf. also Phil 3:9; Ambrosiaster Commentary on Paul’s Epistles (CSEL 81:37); John </p>
<p>Chrysostom Hom. Rom. 2; Basil Humility 20 (Bray 1998: 31–32).</p>
