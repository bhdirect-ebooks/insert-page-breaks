<p>Israel’s Role and Salvation</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>Paul concludes this section regarding God’s plan for the Jewish </p>
<p>people as well as Gentile believers in 11:30–32. at Gentiles and Israel </p>
<p>switched places of disobedience may allude back to Hos 1:10 and 2:23 in </p>
<p>Rom 9:25–26; “mercy” alludes to 9:15–23; Israel’s “disobedience” suggests </p>
<p>Isa 65:2 in Rom 10:21 (though cf. more generally 2:8). God locked up all </p>
<p>under disobedience so that all might be objects of his mercy (cf. similarly </p>
<p>Gal 3:22–23), each in their own time. Jewish disobedience aorded op-</p>
<p>portunity for Gentiles to join the covenant without God being seen as </p>
<p>unfaithful to Israel, and someday, Paul says, Gentile obedience will also </p>
<p>provoke Israel’s repentance.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>In this way, God will have saved and formed</p>
<p>a covenant people comprised of both Jew and Gentile.</p>
<p>Praising God’s Wisdom in History (11:33–36)</p>
<p>Paul has oered briefer doxologies in 1:25 and (near this section’s begin-</p>
<p>ning) 9:5, but here his treatment of God’s plan in history yields to praising </p>
<p>God’s great wisdom in designing history in such a way. is doxology of-</p>
<p>fers a rhetorically rousing conclusion to the section. As oen in Romans, </p>
<p>Paul echoes the language of Scripture (frequently Isaiah) that God’s ways </p>
<p>are beyond human ways (Isa 55:8). In 11:34 Paul cites (making slightly </p>
<p>more concise) the Greek version of Isa 40:13: “Who has known the Lord’s </p>
<p>mind, and who has become his counselor that one should counsel him?”</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> </p>
In 11:35 the closest echo is of God’s reproof about divine ways to Job,
<p>which can be translated: “Who has given something to me, so that I need </p>
<p>to repay them?” (Job 41:11). In context, the Job text involves God’s sover-</p>
<p>eignty over creation; the Isaiah texts involve his sovereignty in history.</p>
<p>Paul has oen spoke of God’s “riches” (2:4; 9:23; 10:12; cf. 11:12), but </p>
<p>the language is particularly appropriate for wisdom and knowledge (cf. </p>
<p>Col 2:2–3; Prov 8:10; 16:16; 20:15; Isa 33:6). Other Jewish people also rec-</p>
<p>ognized that one could not successfully search the depths of God’s mind </p>
<p>(Jdt 8:14; cf. 1 Cor 2:10–11); or that God was inscrutable (anexichniastos, </p>
<p>Job 5:9; 9:10; 34:34). e climax of Paul’s recitation of God’s sovereignty </p>
<p>is that all things are “from,” “through,” and “to” or “for” him (cf. similarly </p>
<p>35. Paul employs here carefully craed rhetorical antithesis. As many note (e.g., Hunter </p>
1966: 54), Paul’s language here involves peoples, not the salvation of all individuals.
<p>36. Others also compare similar biblical questions in Job 15:8; Jer 23:18. Cf. analo-</p>
<p>gous early Jewish language in e.g., Wis 9:13–14; 1QS 11.18–19; 2 Bar. 75:2–4. For Jewish </p>
<p>doxologies, see e.g., Aune 2003: 140–41.</p>
