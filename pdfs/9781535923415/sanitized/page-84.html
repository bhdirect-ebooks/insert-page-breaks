<p>Romans 3:21–31</p>

<p>tion allowed for a more obvious contrast with “works of law.” e church </p>
<p>fathers, many of whom knew the language particularly intimately, also </p>
<p>generally understood this particular phrase as an objective genitive.</p>
<p>In light of such evidence, I am currently inclined to agree with the </p>
<p>conventional “faith in Jesus” understanding, despite the popularity of and </p>
<p>many strong arguments for the currently more fashionable “faith of Jesus” </p>
<p>interpretation. Because for Paul such faith also entails obedience (cf. 1:5), </p>
<p>however, “faith in Jesus” need not be as far from the theological convic-</p>
<p>tions of “faith of Jesus” as some interpreters have contended.</p>
<p>In any case, the emphasis on faith (3:22) rather than dependence on </p>
<p>the law (3:20) annuls a distinction between Jew and Gentile with respect </p>
<p>to salvation (3:22; cf. 10:12): all have likewise sinned (3:23), hence they </p>
<p>can receive righteousness solely through God’s gi in Christ (3:24–25). </p>
<p>e aorist tense of “sinned” in 3:23 need not allude specically to Adam </p>
<p>(2:12, where both Jew and Gentile also sinned), but Paul later unfolds this </p>
<p>idea in terms of Adam’s fall (5:12, 14, 16). Humanity formed in God’s im-</p>
<p>age lost his glory through Adam’s fall (cf. 1:23; 1 Cor 11:7; Ps 8:5), and it </p>
<p>would be restored in Christ (Rom 8:18, 21, 29). (Most commentators here </p>
<p>cite the Jewish tradition of Adam’s glory lost at the fall; the present tense </p>
<p>here could denote continuing eects of that fall. On what Adam lost, see </p>
<p>comment on 5:12–21.) Most Jewish people agreed that virtually all have </p>
<p>sinned (see comment on 3:9).</p>
<p>Many scholars take some or all of Paul’s comments about the so-</p>
<p>lution in 3:24–25 to be Paul’s adaptation of an early Christian tradition </p>
<p>(typically a creed or a hymn).</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>While it would be precarious to rule out</p>
<p>the possibility (there are many terms rare in Paul), we should note that the </p>
<p>grammatical elements cited by nt scholars as characteristic of such creeds </p>
<p>characterize exalted prose more generally, and could simply signal Paul’s </p>
<p>rhetorical shi. In any event, the passage reects Paul’s view, whether or </p>
<p>not it is original with him.</p>

<p>Believers are set right and made righteous as a gi (3:24; through </p>
<p>the new Adam in 5:15, 17) by grace (3:24; contrasted with works of the </p>
<p>law in 4:4, 16; 11:6; associated with the new Adam in 5:15, 17, 20, 21). </p>
<p>For an ancient audience, the mention of either “gi” or “grace” (favor </p>

<p>view).</p>
