<p>Made Right by Trusting Christ</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>uses context</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>to point out that Abraham was put right with God by faith in</p>
<p>Gen 15:6—over thirteen years before hs circumcision (since it preceded </p>
<p>Ishmael’s conception, 16:4; and Ishmael was thirteen at the circumcision, </p>
<p>17:25). “is blessing” (4:9) of which David spoke (4:6–8)—of being </p>
<p>“reckoned” righteous not by works but, as in Gen 15:6, by faith (4:3)—ap-</p>
<p>plied to Abraham before he was circumcised.</p>
<p>People spoke of both ethnic and spiritual ancestry; spiritual ances-</p>
<p>tors were those in whose ways one walked, i.e., those one imitated as if </p>
<p>parents.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>ose who have faith, like Abraham did, are his spiritual heirs</p>
<p>more than those who simply practice the outward seal of circumcision </p>
<p>(4:11–12).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Some Jewish teachers appealed to ancestral merit for blessing,</p>
<p>a benet unavailable to Gentile converts,</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>but Paul allowed Abraham only</p>
<p>as a model.</p>
<p>At this point, a Jewish interlocutor could have replied, “Abraham </p>
<p>was counted righteous as a Godfearer, but joined the covenant by means </p>
<p>of circumcision” (cf. Gen 17:10–14). Paul’s response is that God gave </p>
<p>Abram even the promise of the land while uncircumcised, and certainly </p>
<p>centuries before the law (Rom 4:13). Circumcision was merely an external </p>
<p>“sign” or “seal” of his already-existing faith (4:11), and is not inherently </p>
<p>essential to that faith (here Paul may recall his own argument about spiri-</p>
<p>tual circumcision in 2:25–29). A “seal” could function as a symbol (Exod </p>
<p>28:11, 21, 36); a “sign” of the covenant would be, like the rainbow in Gen </p>
<p>9:12–13, 16–17, a reminder of the deliverance that God had established, </p>
<p>not the deliverance itself.</p>
<p>6. On the typical Jewish application of this principle, see e.g., Longenecker 1975: </p>
<p>118.</p>
<p>7. See Keener 2005a: 3; idem 2003b: 756–57. Many thinkers regarded shared charac-</p>
<p>ter as a closer tie than birth (deSilva 2000: 194–95, 202–6; cf. Philo Heir 68–69).</p>
<p>8. Some later rabbinic sources treat circumcision as a seal (cf. t. Ber. 6:13; also Barn. </p>
<p>9.6), an idea presumably not borrowed from Paul; circumcision as a covenant “sign” </p>
<p>recalls Gen 17:11 (Jub. 15:26). Some think Paul replaced circumcision with baptism </p>
<p>(Lampe 1951: 3–5; Richardson 1958: 352–53), but Paul instead emphasizes faith (Barth </p>
<p>1974: 1:135–43; Dunn 1998: 454–55; rall 1994: 156–58). Paul’s “seal” of the Spirit (2 </p>
<p>Cor 1:22) also does not explicitly mention baptism (though cf. Herm. 93.2–4).</p>
<p>9. For ancestral merit, see e.g., L.A.B. 35:3; T. Lev i 15:4 (if not interpolated); 3 En. </p>
<p>1:3; Sipra Behuq. pq. 8.269.2.5; Sipre Deut. 8.1.1; for the exodus, Mek. Pisha 16.165–68; </p>
<p>Besh. 4.52–54; for its unavailability to proselytes, see later Num. Rab. 8:9. Not all agreed </p>
(Sipre Deut. 329.3.1), and the application of such merit to individual salvation might be
<p>later. Circumcision (Mek. Pisha 16.169–70) and faith (Mek. Besh. 7.135–38) were also </p>
<p>meritorious.</p>
