<p>Romans 5</p>
<p>Made Right by Trusting Christ (1:18—5:11), cont.</p>
<p>Righted and Reconciled by Christ (5:1–11)</p>
<p>In 5:1, Paul reasons from what he has just established (hence “therefore,” </p>
<p>5:1): believers have been righted (so 4:25) by faith (“those who believe” </p>
<p>in 4:24). In light of this established point, Paul addresses believers having </p>
<p>“peace” with God (5:1),</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>i.e., no longer being his enemies (5:10) but being</p>
<p>reconciled to him (5:10–11). is reconciliation is accomplished through </p>
<p>Jesus because of his death and resurrection (4:25).</p>
<p>In 5:2 Paul contends that Jesus has also ushered believers into grace </p>
<p>by faith (for grace and faith, cf. 3:22, 24; 4:3–4, 16); the perfect tense of </p>
<p>“stand” suggests that believers remain in this grace (cf. “stand” in contrast </p>
<p>to “fall” in 11:20; 14:4). Whereas Paul has denounced one who falsely </p>
<p>“boasts” (kauchaomai) in God or the law (2:17, 23), Paul notes that in </p>
<p>Jesus believers can boast in hope (5:2), in the face of suering condent </p>
<p>that it leads to hope (5:3–5), and in God (5:11).</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>“Hope” here follows</p>
<p>the example of Abraham’s resurrection hope in the preceding paragraph </p>
<p>(4:18), but in this case the focus is eschatological salvation (cf. 8:20, 24–</p>
<p>25). Believers hope for sharing God’s “glory” (8:18, 21, 30), what was lost </p>
<p>in Adam (cf. 3:23; 1 Cor 11:7).</p>
<p>Like Abraham, however (cf. 4:19), Paul wants believers to trust </p>
<p>God’s promise even when they faced obstacles that made it appear un-</p>
<p>1. Scholars debate whether the original text of Romans says “We have peace with </p>
<p>God” or “Let us have peace with God.” Although the latter has signicant textual at-</p>
<p>testation, the majority of commentators argue that the former makes more sense of the </p>
<p>context, and the latter would be a natural scribal error (if the scribe heard a long ō for a </p>
<p>short o).</p>
<p>2. We may debate whether 5:11 is a third case or a summary of the rst two. If the for-</p>
<p>mer, it could be relevant that one might support a rhetorical thesis with three illustrations </p>
<p>or points (Quintilian Inst. 4.5.3; cf. Cicero Mur. 5.11; Pliny the Younger Ep. 2.20.9).</p>
