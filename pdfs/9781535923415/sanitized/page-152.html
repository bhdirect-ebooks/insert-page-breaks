<p>126</p>
<p>their righteousness (for, as the context in Deut 9:5–6 reiterates, they were </p>
<p>not righteous).</p>
<p>e heart of Paul’s argument here, however, derives from Deut </p>
<p>30:12–14. In a closely argued midrash, Paul oers an analogy with God’s </p>
<p>way of salvation in Deuteronomy, expecting structural continuity on the </p>
<p>level of principle and how God deals with humanity. Both cases involve </p>
<p>an obedient response to God’s gracious acts in salvation history, rather </p>
<p>than authoring such salvation ourselves.</p>
<p>Deut 30:12–14 Paul’s application in Rom 10:6–10</p>
<p>Do not say, “Who will ascend to </p>
<p>heaven?”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>(to bring down Torah,</p>
<p>God’s gi, 30:12)</p>
<p>Do not say, “Who will ascend to </p>
<p>heaven?” (to bring down Christ, </p>
<p>God’s gi, 10:6)</p>
<p>Do not say, “Who will descend </p>
<p>into the deep?” (to experience </p>
<p>redemption again, crossing the </p>
<p>“sea,” 30:13)</p>
<p>Do not say, “Who will descend into </p>
<p>the abyss?”</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>(to experience salvation</p>
<p>again, raising Christ from the dead, </p>
<p>10:7)</p>
<p>e Word is near you (the Torah, </p>
<p>30:14)</p>
<p>e word is near you (the message </p>
<p>of faith we now preach, 10:8)</p>
<p>It is in your mouth and in your </p>
<p>heart (30:14; as Torah was to be </p>
<p>recited continually [Deut 6:6–7])</p>
<p>It is in your mouth and in your </p>
<p>heart: confess with the mouth Jesus </p>
<p>is Lord, and believe with the heart </p>
<p>that God raised him (10:9–10)</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>e point in Deuteronomy was that the law was not too dicult </p>
<p>for Israel (Deut 30:11), provided it was written in the heart (Deut 5:29; </p>
<p>10:16; 30:6). Paul would agree (Rom 8:2–4), while expecting it to be ful-</p>
<p>lled only on a widespread scale in the new covenant (Jer 31:33). e law </p>
<p>5. Jewish traditions viewed Moses as having ascended to heaven to receive the Torah </p>
<p>(Sipre Deut. 49.2.1; cf. Bar 3:29 with 4:1), though in Scripture he ascended only Sinai.</p>
<p>6. In the most common Greek version of Scripture, one could speak of the depths of </p>
<p>the sea as an “abyss” (e.g., Job 28:14; 38:16, 30; Ps 33:7; Sir 24:29; Man 3), even in contrast </p>
<p>to heaven, as here (Ps 107:26; perhaps also Gen 7:11; 8:2; Deut 33:13; Ps 135:6; Sir 1:3; </p>
<p>16:18; 24:5). Most relevant for Paul’s usage here are texts about God bringing his people </p>
<p>through the abyssos of the sea in the exodus (the point of Deut 30): Ps 106:9, where </p>
<p>God “saved” them (106:8–10) despite their rebellion (106:7); and Isa 51:10, emphasizing </p>
<p>God’s “righteousness” and “salvation” (Isa 51:8); and others (Ps 77:16; Isa 63:13; Wis </p>
<p>10:19); and possibly a new exodus in Isa 44:27. Shiing terms might allow Paul to play on </p>
<p>the image’s associations with death (Ezek 31:15). Philo and others felt free to adapt this </p>
<p>passage’s language (Tobin 2004: 344–45), and a later targum speaks of “abyss” here.</p>
