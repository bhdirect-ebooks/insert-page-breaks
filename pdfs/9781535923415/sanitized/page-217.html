<p>15:26; 2 Cor 9:4; 1 Cor 16:3). e author of Acts, traditionally identi-</p>
<p>ed as “Luke,” may have accompanied Paul from Philippi (Acts 20:5–6); </p>
<p>whether this is the “Lucius” of the present verse (who might then have </p>
<p>gone on ahead to Philippi) is dicult to say.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>Tertius (whose Latin name suggests a third-born male) in 16:22 was </p>
<p>the scribe who penned the letter at Paul’s dictation. Scribes were some-</p>
<p>times professionals and sometimes educated slaves of the wealthy; the </p>
<p>poor needed their help, and the rich could aord it.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>at he adds his</p>
<p>own greeting suggests that he belonged to the Christian community, pre-</p>
<p>sumably in Corinth (from which Paul is writing).</p>
<p>Scholars debate how Gaius was “host” to the entire church in Corinth </p>
<p>(16:23), which now met in multiple homes. Some think he had a wealthy </p>
<p>villa where all the house churches could assemble together periodically; </p>
<p>others believe that he was the original church’s sponsor (before multiple </p>
<p>assemblies grew), his full Roman name being Gaius Titius Justus (Acts </p>
<p>18:7). Perhaps he simply had shown hospitality to many and Paul oers </p>
<p>hyperbolic praise. In any case, he is a patron and person of means, pre-</p>
<p>sumably part of Corinth’s citizen class (who were Roman citizens). As </p>
<p>“Tertius” (16:22) identies a third-born male, “Quartus” (16:23) identi-</p>
<p>es a fourth-born.</p>
<p>Most intriguing is Erastus, city treasurer or manager (16:23). </p>
<p>Because the Greek phrase describing his work here is more general than </p>
<p>a corresponding Latin one would be, scholars debate his exact role. An </p>
<p>inscription from this era mentions one Erastus (presumably from the </p>
<p>city’s same political class) as Corinth’s aedile. While some scholars be-</p>
<p>lieve that a dierent Erastus is in view, others (including the editor of the </p>
<p>Corinthian inscriptions) identify them.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> Although a “manager” (oikono-</p>
<p>mos) was usually of lower status than an aedile (because the former was </p>
<p>a much more common oce), it was also one of the Greek terms used </p>
<p>38. Traditional identications of “Luke” are with the Gentile physician in Col 4:14 </p>
<p>(cf. Col 4:11), whereas those named in Rom 16:21 are Jewish (as a Jewish name, e.g., </p>
<p>CIJ 1:111, §155). e matter is discussed in greater detail in various commentaries on </p>
<p>Romans and Acts, including my forthcoming commentary on Acts with Hendrickson.</p>
