<p>Romans 9:6–29</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>make clear that Paul is using this argument to prepare for his case that </p>
<p>only a “remnant” within Israel will be saved. Paul cites both Gen 25:23 </p>
<p>and Mal 1:1–2 to support the notion that God’s favor for Jacob depended </p>
<p>on his gracious calling and choice before Jacob performed works.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>us,</p>
mere genetic descent is not what counts, but being divinely chosen (9:8);
<p>11</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul emphasizes the promise, which he has already associated with those </p>
<p>who believe (Rom 4:16).</p>
<p>Because Scripture oen associated God’s righteousness with his </p>
<p>covenant faithfulness to Israel, the failure of some Israelites to believe </p>
<p>could appear to some as a sign of God’s unrighteousness (9:14, essentially </p>
<p>repackaging the objection in 3:3, 5). But the very question is misplaced, </p>
<p>Paul shows, for God is right to do as he pleases, and what he pleases will </p>
<p>always be what is right. Humanity merits punishment, but God shows </p>
<p>mercy and compassion where he wills (9:15),</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>graciously saving some</p>
<p>though he is obligated to save none (cf. 3:23). In the context of the passage </p>
<p>that Paul cites in 9:15 (Exod 33:19, addressed to Moses), Israel has sinned </p>
<p>and God plans to withdraw his presence. Because Moses found favor in </p>
<p>God’s sight, however, his intercession for Israel (33:13–16; 34:9) proved </p>
<p>ecacious—God revealed his character, which included compassion to </p>
<p>the undeserving (33:17, 19) and his covenant love that exceeded his wrath </p>
<p>(34:6–7).</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>(at the runner would not prevail by his own eort recalls</p>
<p>biblical pictures of how judgment or death would overtake all, Eccl 9:11; </p>
<p>Jer 46:6; Amos 2:14–15.)</p>
<p>10. Both of these passages in context emphasize God’s grace in treating Israel as spe-</p>
<p>cial. In the context in Gen 25 the birth of both children was a gi (v. 21); in Malachi, God </p>
<p>shows Israel how special they are, versus Edom that has opposed them. Paul approaches </p>
<p>the texts not to emphasize Israel’s specialness, however, but to emphasize something </p>
<p>about God: he is free to show grace where he desires.</p>
<p>11. Cf. Gal 3:14–29; 4:23–28, where Paul is thinking of the inclusion of Gentiles </p>
<p>(Hays 1989: 187–88). For discussion of predestination, see comment on 8:29–30.</p>
<p>12. Cf. similar expressions of God’s sovereignty in Tob 4:19; 13:2, 5; much later, Gk. </p>
<p>Apoc. Ezra 2:17. e conjunction of issues of justice (9:14) and mercy (9:15) may recall </p>
the concern in 3:26 (on justice and mercy as competing divine attributes in later rabbis,
<p>see e.g., Urbach 1979: 1:448–61).</p>
<p>13. Paul in 9:3 alluded to Moses’s intercession in Exod 32:32, because of which God </p>
<p>spared Israel (comparing himself with Moses hence presumably his Jewish detractors </p>
<p>with Pharaoh); the same context remains in view. Moses pleads for favor in God’s sight </p>
<p>(33:13, 16—all the while asking it for Israel). God does grant Moses favor (33:17), an-</p>
<p>swering his prayer to go with Israel (33:18); he does show mercy in response to Moses’s </p>
<p>request.</p>
