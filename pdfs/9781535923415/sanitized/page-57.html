<p>Made Right by Trusting Christ (1:18—5:11)</p>
<p>Modern outlines cannot do justice to Paul’s careful thinking in Romans, </p>
<p>which oen transitions seamlessly from one point in his argument to the </p>
<p>next. It is not possible to sever 1:18–23 from 1:16–17, but we have fol-</p>
lowed the traditional division here. In 1:18—5:11, Paul argues at length
<p>that Jew and Gentile alike are made righteous only through depending </p>
<p>on Christ.</p>
<p>Inexcusable Idolatry (1:18–23)</p>
<p>Instead of believing truth in the gospel, some corrupt even the truth they </p>
<p>have in nature. While God’s saving righteousness is “revealed” in the </p>
<p>gospel for those who trust it (1:16–17), God’s wrath is “revealed” against </p>
<p>those who suppress the truth by unrighteousness (1:18–23).</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>e truth</p>
<p>they unrighteously suppress is the truth about God (1:25; cf. 2:8), which </p>
<p>they suppress, ultimately, by idolatry (1:19–23).</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>is denunciation oers a key transition in Paul’s larger argument </p>
<p>that shows that both Gentiles and Jews need the gospel. Jewish people </p>
<p>regarded idolatry (1:23) and sexual vice (1:24–25), especially homosexual </p>
<p>behavior (1:26–27), as characteristically Gentile sins. But aer Paul de-</p>
<p>nounces such sins to his audience’s applause, he quickly turns to more </p>
<p>universal sins (1:29–31), nally consigning his own people, knowledge-</p>
<p>able of the law, to judgment as well (2:17–29; 3:9, 19–20). (Cf. the same </p>
<p>tactic in Amos 1:3—2:8.) Although condemning Gentiles in 1:18–32, Paul </p>
<p>employs for this condemnation biblical language regarding Israel, prob-</p>
<p>ably evoking such texts in the memories of his more biblically informed </p>
<p>hearers and preparing for his wider argument in the next chapter.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>Although God’s wrath (1:18) has a future aspect (e.g., 2:5, 8; 9:22), </p>
<p>it is revealed in the present here especially through God “handing over” </p>
<p>sinners to the consequences of their own sinfulness (1:24, 26, 28; cf. </p>
<p>58. Salvation and wrath seem to be two sides of God’s righteousness (1:16–18); the </p>
<p>latter responds to human unrighteousness (1:18). e gospel reveals the former (1:16) </p>
<p>and presupposes the situation (depicted in 1:18–32) of the latter.</p>
<p>59. Recognized also by Ambrosiaster and Apollinaris of Laodicea (Bray 1998: 35).</p>
<p>60. E.g., the language of Ps 94:11 in Rom 1:21; exchanging God’s glory for idols (1:23) </p>
<p>in Ps 106:20 (cf. Jer 2:11; possibly language from Deut 4:16–18); perhaps also moral </p>
<p>hardening (cf. Rom 1:28; 11:7, 25) and the handing over to their sins (Rom 1:24; Ps </p>
<p>81:12).</p>
