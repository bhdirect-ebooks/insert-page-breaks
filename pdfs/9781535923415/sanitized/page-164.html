<p>Romans 11:25–32</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>Nevertheless, context again raises a likely problem with this approach. </p>
<p>Paul expects the obedience of a number of Gentiles from all nations to </p>
<p>the God of Israel to provoke Israel to jealousy, hence to turn to Jesus, </p>
<p>bringing about the promised restoration (11:11–15). is observation </p>
<p>suggests Paul’s expectation of the second option: the completion of the </p>
<p>Gentile mission in 11:25 would in turn lead to the Jewish people trusting </p>
<p>in Christ, precipitating his return (reading houtōs in 11:26 as “in this way,” </p>
<p>“by this means”). On this reading, perhaps Paul uses Isa 59:20–21 to refer </p>
<p>to a corporate deliverance and covenant renewal immediately following </p>
<p>the turning (or even simply to conrm God’s plan to forgive Israel). In any </p>
<p>case, the nal line of Paul’s quotation in 11:27 is not from Isa 59:21, which </p>
<p>says, “is is my covenant with them,” but lacks “when I take away their </p>
<p>sins.” Here Paul may interpretively blend an allusion to the Greek version </p>
<p>of some texts using this language in the context of end-time restoration </p>
<p>(Isa 27:9 or Ezek 36:26).</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>In 11:28 Paul contrasts two ways of looking at his people: the current </p>
<p>demands of the promised good news (which Israel as a whole has not </p>
<p>embraced), and the benets of their heritage. From the rst approach, </p>
<p>they remain God’s “enemies” (like all humanity not in Christ, 5:10; 8:7) </p>
<p>“on account of you” (which contextually means, “so that in God’s provi-</p>
<p>dence you Gentiles have opportunity to enter God’s covenant,” 11:11, 19, </p>
<p>25). From the second approach, they remain objects of God’s love</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>“on</p>
<p>account of the patriarchs” (11:28), one of their ancestral blessings (9:5), </p>
<p>as Scripture declared (Deut 4:37; 7:7–8; 10:15; cf. Mal 1:2 in Rom 9:13). </p>
<p>While some Jewish teachers later associated God’s favor on Israel with </p>
<p>the patriarchs’ “merits,” Paul’s interest is not ancestral works (cf. 4:2; 9:11) </p>
but simply God’s grace. While this favor did not save individual Jewish
<p>persons, it guaranteed that God would not abandon his plan for Israel </p>
<p>and that he would turn the Jewish people to himself in the planned time </p>
<p>(11:25–27). us, in 11:29 God, who knows the future (cf. 8:29; 11:2), will </p>
<p>not regret his “gis” and “calling” to the Jewish people as a whole, though </p>
Gentile believers (individually) participate in these blessings as well.
<p>34</p>
<p>32. Paul might also think of another “covenant” passage, the “new covenant” (Jer </p>
<p>31:31–34), when God would forgive Israel’s sins (Jer 31:34).</p>
<p>33. Again like humanity (5:8), but with a special privilege.</p>
<p>34. For “gis,” see 1:11; 12:6 (esp. for salvation, 5:15–16; 6:23); “calling” includes not </p>
<p>only Jewish people (9:7) but all who believe (1:6–7; 8:28–30; 9:24–26). Perhaps Israel’s </p>
<p>“gis” include those in 9:4–5.</p>
