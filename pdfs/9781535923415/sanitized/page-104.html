<p>the Spirit (8:2). e contrast between the old and new covenant was that </p>
<p>God’s people would observe the new covenant, the laws being now writ-</p>
<p>ten in their hearts (2:29; 7:6; 8:2; Jer 31:33). Flesh in Adam cannot fulll </p>
<p>this righteousness. What the law could not do—make people righteous—</p>
<p>God had done in Christ (8:3). Climaxing his contrast between the fruits </p>
<p>of Adam and Christ, Paul notes that the greater the sin, the greater the </p>
<p>grace that countered it (5:20–21).</p>
