<p>Fusing the Horizons: Church and State</p>

<p>18</p>
<p>Nor did</p>
<p>Paul have reason to envision modern democracies, in which Christians as </p>
<p>citizens would in a sense constitute part of the government, and hence need </p>
<p>to evaluate and critique government activities. Finally, Paul lacked reason </p>
<p>to envision this minority movement ending up in a situation of signiﬁcant </p>
<p>inﬂuence over the political process and so being able to address large-scale </p>
<p>injustices like slavery (despite Paul’s personal concerns, cf. Phlm 16–21). </p>
<p>Opposed to ideologies behind the Judean revolt, Paul was likely in practice a </p>
<p>paciﬁst. But what do personal paciﬁsts do in extreme cases, when their inﬂu-</p>
<p>ence affects whether genocide may be forcibly stopped? German theologian </p>
<p>Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a paciﬁst, ultimately participated in a plot against Hitler </p>
<p>because of the magnitude of evil involved.</p>
While few would support the divine right of kings today, the subservience
<p>of the leaders of the German state church to Hitler’s Third Reich, based on </p>
<p>this passage, raised anew the issue of its application, and Christian coop-</p>
<p>eration with the apartheid government in South Africa had the same effect. </p>
<p>Abolitionists and liberation theologians have long grappled with these issues. </p>
<p>Most likely, Paul would have applied 13:1–7 as the norm where possible, </p>
<p>living in a respectable manner in society but allowing dissent where necessary </p>
<p>and political participation for justice when possible. For example, he would </p>
<p>presumably urge Christians in China (given the normal situation there at the </p>
<p>time I am writing this) to be model Chinese citizens, yet without imbibing </p>
<p>atheism. In cases of wholesale massacres of Christians or their neighbors, </p>
<p>such as have happened at various times in northern Nigeria, the Indian state </p>
<p>of Orissa, parts of Indonesia, and so forth, conclusions are harder to come </p>
<p>by (though these were not sponsored by national governments, a situation </p>
<p>closer to, e.g., the Turkish genocide of Armenians in 1915). I am inclined to </p>
<p>think that Paul would not endorse armed resistance in such cases, but it is </p>
<p>admittedly easy for me to pontiﬁcate from a currently safe location. I know of </p>
other settings where suppression and the killings of individuals led to armed
<p>uprisings, which most often led to more suffering without decisive liberation; </p>
<p>but other solutions seemed hard to come by. Once we recognize that Paul’s </p>
<p>words addressed a particular historical situation, translating the message into </p>
<p>new situations becomes more problematic.</p>
<p>Respect for one’s government and the expected obligations of citizenship </p>
<p>have limits (though as a modern Western reader I am probably overly inclined </p>
