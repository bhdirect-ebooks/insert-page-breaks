<p>Israel’s Role and Salvation</p>

<p>nor sought to obey it). Paul has already indicated that the right way to </p>
<p>use the law is to inspire trust in God rather than condence in one’s own </p>
<p>keeping of its precepts (3:27, 31; cf. 8:2), and will develop this argument </p>
<p>further in 10:5–10.</p>
<p>In 9:32–33 Paul notes that Scripture had already indicated Israel’s </p>
<p>failure (he also notes this in 10:16): many in Zion would stumble, except </p>
<p>those who trusted in the rock of their salvation. Paul here conates two </p>
<p>related Isaiah texts: 8:14 (a stumbling stone) and 28:16 (“I lay in Zion </p>
<p>a . . . stone . . . and whoever trusts in it will not be put to shame”).</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>the context of Isa 8:14, it is God whom Israel should fear (Isa 8:13); God </p>
<p>himself would become their sanctuary, but Israel would stumble over this </p>
<p>rock instead of welcoming it (8:14–15). In the next passage, God decrees </p>
<p>judgment on Israel (28:1–29), but lays in Zion a precious cornerstone, so </p>
<p>that whoever trusted in it would not be ashamed (28:16)—i.e., would be </p>
<p>kept through the judgment. For Paul, believers would not be “ashamed” </p>
<p>or “disappointed” regarding their eschatological hope of salvation (Rom </p>
<p>5:5; 10:11). e saved remnant would be saved through faith.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>For Paul,</p>
<p>this faith in the cornerstone must be christocentric faith.</p>

<p>23. Part of Israel’s problem may be lack of acceptance of God’s sovereignty in terms </p>
<p>of recognizing the gi as unmerited (9:15–21), although many of Paul’s contemporaries </p>
<p>would have contested this diagnosis.</p>
24. e rock in Isa 8:14–15 is divine; Paul applies to Jesus the image of a divine rock
<p>in 1 Cor 10:4; see comment in Keener 2005b: 85. Jesus had described himself as a cor-</p>
<p>nerstone (Mark 12:10), using Ps 118:22; some early Christians linked that text with those </p>
<p>that Paul cites here (1 Pet 2:6–8; see discussion in Longenecker 1970: 50–53).</p>
