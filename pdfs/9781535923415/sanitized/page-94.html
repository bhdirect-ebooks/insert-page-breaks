<p>Romans 4:13–25</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>as he was “fully persuaded” (4:21), so should they be (14:5); as he refused </p>
<p>to doubt (diakrinō; 4:20), so should they (14:23). Likewise, he avoided </p>
<p>unbelief (apistia; 4:20), in contrast to much of contemporary Israel (3:3; </p>
<p>11:20, 23). In contrast to those who refused to glorify God even aer his </p>
<p>works (1:21), Abraham gloried him before the fulllment of his prom-</p>
<p>ise (4:20), counting his word as good as done (though he acknowledged </p>
<p>fully his own physical state; 4:19). Abraham is thus a striking example </p>
<p>of loyal, obedient faith, and this is the sort of faith that was counted as </p>
<p>righteousness (4:22). Paul oers no comfort to those, in his day (3:8) or </p>
<p>in recent centuries, who think that his view of saving faith is irrelevant to </p>
<p>life, merely untested assent to a widely shared proposition.</p>
<p>e object of faith is also signicant. e repeated theme of “prom-</p>
<p>ise” here (4:20–21; also 4:13–14, 16) might recall for Paul’s audience the </p>
<p>importance of trusting the promised Messiah (1:2–4). e promise of the </p>
<p>“seed” (descendants; 4:18) may point to a key element in Paul’s analogy. </p>
<p>Most important in Paul’s analogy is Abraham’s faith in God’s message </p>
<p>to him, but that message foreshadowed the gospel in key ways. Just as </p>
<p>the promise of inheriting “the world” (4:13) foreshadowed the kingdom </p>
<p>(i.e., the expected reign of the Messiah), so the promised seed may have </p>
<p>foreshadowed a more particular seed (cf. Gal 3:16). Isaac was the child of </p>
<p>promise (9:8), but his lineage also included a later promise, the seed of </p>
<p>David (Rom 1:3; cf. 2 Sam 7:12). ose in Christ would reign with him </p>
<p>(Rom 5:17; cf. Dan 7:14, 22).</p>
<p>More specically, in 4:19, his faith in the God who could surmount </p>
<p>the “deadness” of his body</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>and Sarah’s womb was resurrection faith</p>
<p>(4:17).</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Abraham modeled faith not simply abstractly, but by believing</p>
<p>in a promised seed and in resurrection; these objects oered a concrete </p>
<p>model for believers in Jesus’s resurrection (4:24).</p>
<p>All along, Paul thus has in mind his objective of applying the text </p>
<p>to his audience, and he says so plainly in 4:23–24. Events in biblical his-</p>
<p>tory may have happened for the sake of those involved in them, but they </p>
<p>were written for subsequent generations to learn from their example (cf. </p>
<p>19. He was “about one hundred” when the promise was fullled, not when (many </p>
<p>years earlier) it was given (unless one is rounding to the nearest half century). e “dead-</p>
<p>ness” of his body also anticipates the resurrection of believers’ “dead” (mortal) bodies </p>
<p>(8:10–11). Cf. Heb 11:12.</p>
<p>20. e author of Hebrews, who focuses on Abraham oering up Isaac, also nds </p>
<p>anticipatory resurrection faith there (Heb 11:17–19).</p>
