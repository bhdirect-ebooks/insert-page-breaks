<p>association of the law with death in 7:9–11. Nevertheless, sin and death </p>
<p>clearly go back to Adam (5:14). Sin brings death, even before the coming </p>
<p>of the (Mosaic) law; the law simply allows sin to be reckoned, or counted </p>
<p>(5:13).</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Natural law already counted sin, but the more concrete Mosaic</p>
<p>law invites fuller judgment (2:12–15). In mentioning those who did not </p>
<p>sin like Adam (5:14), Paul might qualify (hence perhaps forestall objec-</p>
<p>tions against) his argument that all have sinned like Adam and sin brings </p>
<p>death. ose before the law could not sin like Adam (who transgressed </p>
<p>an express commandment), yet shared the mortality of humanity as a </p>
<p>whole.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Paul develops this contrast between Adam and Christ in 5:15–20. In </p>
<p>Jewish traditions, Adam was the rst-formed model for humanity,</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>full</p>
<p>of “glory” before his fall (cf. 3:23).</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> (Some rabbis later than Paul even por-</p>
<p>trayed Adam as enormous, “lling the earth” by himself.)</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>If Adam lost</p>
<p>his glory through sin, Paul expects a restoration through another Adam </p>
<p>(cf. also 1 Cor 15:22, 45–49). e structure of Genesis already connected </p>
<p>Noah and Abraham with Adam by means of two genealogies of roughly </p>
<p>ten generations each, ending in three sons (Gen 5:6–32; 11:10–26; cf. </p>
<p>also m. ’Abot 5:2). e accounts of each of these three patriarchs included </p>
<p>blessings, a commission to multiply and subdue land, and curses (Gen </p>
<p>1:28; 3:14–15; 9:1–7, 25; 12:1–3). Noah (Gen 5:29) and Abraham were </p>
<p>steps on the way back to paradise (cf. Gen. Rab. 14:6); but Paul looks </p>
<p>ultimately to a second Adam.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Ancient rhetoric made abundant use of comparison (synkrisis), but </p>
<p>the objects compared did not need to be precisely equivalent (as Paul in-</p>
<p>18. A cognate of the term for “reckoned” with respect to righteousness by faith in </p>
<p>ch. 4.</p>
<p>19. e same might be said of infants, who did not transgress like Adam (given the </p>
<p>high rate of infant and childhood mortality in Paul’s world, he could not but have known </p>
<p>of such cases).</p>
<p>20. Wis 10:1; L.A.B. 37:3.</p>
<p>21. E.g., 3 Bar. 4:16; Apoc. Mos. 39:2; ’Abot R. Nat. 1 A; Pesiq. Rab Kah. 4:4; 26:3; cf. </p>
<p>perhaps CD 3.20. For his primordial beauty, see Sib. Or. 1.24.</p>
<p>22. E.g., ’Abot R. Nat. 8, §22; 42, §116 B. Aer the fall, however, he was cut down to </p>
<p>one hundred cubits (Pesiq. Rab Kah. 1:1; 5:3; cf. Sipra Behuq. pq. 3.263.1.9).</p>
<p>23. is may reverse the expectation in some Diaspora Jewish interpretation, where </p>
<p>the rst man of Gen 1 was greater than the second man they inferred in Gen 2 (Philo </p>
<p>Alleg. Interp. 1.31–32; 2.4–5). Many Jewish eschatological texts compared the future </p>
<p>paradise with the beginning (e.g., Sipra Behuq. pq. 1.261.1.6).</p>
