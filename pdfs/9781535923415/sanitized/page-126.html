<p>Romans 8:1–17</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>crucixion, raising him as head of a new humanity,</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>i.e., his body (see</p>
<p>comment at 7:4; 12:5).</p>
<p>What esh could not accomplish, however, God did in Christ; the </p>
<p>Spirit within believers would cause them to live out righteousness (8:4). </p>
<p>at Paul attributes this empowerment to the law of the Spirit is not sur-</p>
<p>prising, for the new covenant diered from the old covenant precisely in </p>
<p>that God’s people would now obey it (Jer 31:32–33) by God’s own Spirit </p>
<p>(Ezek 36:27). Contrary to his detractors (3:8), Paul is not antinomian; he </p>
<p>expects the righteous life attested in the law, but expects it by depend-</p>
<p>ing on God’s Spirit rather than human esh. (Paul is thinking not of all </p>
individual commandments but of the righteous character that such com-
<p>mandments were intended to inculcate and point toward in an ancient </p>
<p>Israelite context.)</p>
<p>In contrast to the law-informed mind defeated by the esh in 7:22–23, </p>
<p>Paul speaks here of a “frame of mind” (habitual way of thinking) guided </p>
by the Spirit (8:5–7). Philosophers spoke of focusing the mind on divine
<p>matters rather than bodily passions; Paul speaks of a new perspective on </p>
<p>reality informed by God’s Spirit active in one’s life rather than dependence </p>
<p>or obsession with one’s own ways (8:5).</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>For Paul, the mind-frame of the</p>
<p>esh produced death (8:6); that is, the mind dominated by bodily desires </p>
<p>(7:23) stood under the body’s sentence of death (7:24). But the frame of </p>
<p>mind dominated by the Spirit involves life and peace (8:6): both eternal </p>
<p>life (5:21; 6:23) and peace with God (5:1) established through Christ. Paul </p>
<p>would also know that the mind trusting in God has “peace” in the Hebrew </p>
<p>version of Isa 26:3.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>e eshly mind was at enmity with God (8:7), i.e., not reconciled </p>
<p>through Christ (5:10). e inability to submit to God’s law (8:7) has already </p>
<p>been summarized in 7:16–23. e inability of the esh to please God (8:8) </p>
<p>6. Sending Jesus in the “likeness” (cf. 5:14; 6:5) or image of sinful humanity (cf. Phil </p>
<p>2:7) probably suggests (in a manner consistent with 1 Cor 8:6; Phil 2:6–8) that Paul views </p>
<p>Jesus as preexistent (Hurtado 2003: 196; cf. Byrne 1997); in Paul’s theology, Jesus was </p>
<p>fully human, but was himself sinless (2 Cor 5:21). To paraphrase Athanasius, in this </p>
<p>context Jesus came in humanity’s likeness (8:3) so humans might ultimately share again </p>
the divine likeness (8:29).
