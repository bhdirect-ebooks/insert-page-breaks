<p>Israel’s Role and Salvation</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>was not far from them, nor did they have to work to bring it near (Deut </p>
<p>30:12–13); it was a gi. By analogy with God’s earlier savic activity, Paul </p>
<p>insists that righteousness is also a gi now. e word was near Israel, and </p>
<p>that was why they could carry it out (Deut 30:14)—provided they wel-</p>
<p>comed its nearness, written in the heart (cf. Pss 37:31; 40:8; 119:80, 112; </p>
<p>Isa 51:7). Just as God prefaced the Ten Commandments with a reminder </p>
<p>of redemption (Exod 20:2), so now salvation from sin was by grace </p>
<p>through faith, expressed by right-doing. God’s way of saving through the </p>
<p>newer historical salvation event in Christ is analogous to the way he saved </p>
<p>through the law:</p>
<p>7</p>
the divine word (the gospel) also involves heart and
<p>mouth, though not just by reciting for memory. e heart trusts what </p>
<p>God has done for salvation, and the mouth acknowledges Christ as Lord </p>
<p>(embracing all the behavioral consequences of this new master).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>e way</p>
<p>of righteousness in 10:5–10 (climaxing in righteousness and salvation) is </p>
<p>thus why Jews had no salvic advantage over Gentiles if both heard the </p>
<p>message (9:30–31).</p>
<p>Response of Israel and the Gentiles (10:11–21)</p>
<p>Paul has argued that the law does not give Jewish people an unfair ad-</p>
<p>vantage over Gentiles with respect to God’s righteousness (9:30—10:10). </p>
<p>Now Paul makes explicit from Scripture this equality of opportunity </p>
<p>(10:11–13). He will aerward show from Scripture that the “message of </p>
<p>faith” (10:8) is in fact widely available, but has not been accepted by Israel, </p>
<p>a tragic pattern that Scripture predisposes us to accept (10:14–21).</p>
<p>Recalling the believing heart for righteousness in 10:10, Paul shows </p>
<p>from a text that he has recently quoted (in 9:33) that whoever trusts in </p>
<p>God will not be shamed (in the day of judgment; 10:11). Following the </p>
<p>ancient Jewish exegetical principle of linking texts based on a common key </p>
<p>word, Paul shockingly uses “all” as the key word (though “not ashamed” </p>
<p>7. e parallel between Christ and law here makes sense in view of the early Christian </p>
<p>association of Jesus with wisdom (e.g., 1 Cor 8:6; Col 1:15–17; later, John 1:1–18); wisdom </p>
<p>was oen associated with Torah (Sir 24:23; 34:8; 39:1; Bar 3:29—4:1; 4 Macc 1:16–17; </p>
<p>Sipre Deut. 37.1.3; cf. further Epp 1975: 133–36). As Paul presumably knew, Bar 3:29–30 </p>
<p>in fact applies this very Deuteronomy passage to wisdom/law.</p>
<p>8. Confession from the heart of Christ as the risen Lord thus contrasts with claiming </p>
<p>one’s own merit in one’s heart, as in Deut 9:4, alluded to in Rom 10:6. e language of </p>
<p>“confession” as “Lord” by itself would probably connote deity, a connotation conrmed </p>
<p>by 10:13.</p>
