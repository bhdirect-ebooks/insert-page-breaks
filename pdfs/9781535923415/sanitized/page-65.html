<p>Fusing the Horizons: Homosexual Activity</p>

<p>claims as examples of Nero’s moral madness; as polygamy was illegal and </p>
<p>Nero married heterosexually as well, these other unions were not taken in </p>
<p>the same way. Later rabbis mythically depict ancient Israel’s enemies as in-</p>
<p>volved in such marriages (Sipra A.M. par. 8.193.1.7), but without relying on </p>
<p>genuine historical information. Apart from rare exceptions like these (most of </p>
<p>them meant to evoke horror), however, ancients thought of marriage as het-</p>
<p>erosexual unions designed especially to produce legitimate heirs, regardless </p>
<p>of their views toward homosexual behavior. With a few exceptions, “marriage” </p>
<p>by deﬁnition involved both genders (and an economic agreement between </p>
<p>families).</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>Those who engaged in homosexual romance, even in the rarer</p>
<p>cases when it involved long-term sexual relationships into adulthood, would </p>
<p>not have used the title “marriage” to describe it.</p>
<p>Most readers today would share Paul’s revulsion against the dominant </p>
<p>forms of homosexual practice in his day: pederasty in both its voluntary and </p>
<p>involuntary forms. Some scholars (especially Scroggs) argue that Paul opposed </p>
<p>merely pederasty or other kinds of sexual exploitation. Critics of this proposal </p>
<p>sometimes too readily dismiss the evidence for it: as we have observed, peder-</p>
<p>asty was in fact the dominant expression of homosexual activity in the ancient </p>
<p>Mediterranean world.</p>
<p>But did Paul limit his criticism to simply those forms that remain most </p>
<p>offensive in Western culture today? The dominant practice was not the only </p>
<p>practice, and the word “pederast” was already available. More importantly, </p>
<p>as most commentators (e.g., Jewett, Byrne) point out, he speciﬁes lesbian </p>
<p>as well as male homosexual behavior, and it is the same-sex element of the </p>
<p>behavior that he explicitly targets.</p>
<p>The same criticism may be leveled against the view that Paul merely re-</p>
<p>jects homosexual behavior in the way that some philosophers did, as a failure </p>
<p>to control one’s appetites (comparable to gluttony). Rather, Paul’s rejection of </p>
<p>homosexual behavior belongs to his larger Jewish sexual ethic, which rejects </p>
<p>all sexual behavior outside heterosexual marriage. His “against nature” argu-</p>
<p>ment echoes philosophic arguments that other Diaspora Jews had already ap-</p>
<p>plied to homosexual behavior in general. Readers today may agree or disagree </p>
<p>with Paul, but some modern attempts, no matter how valiant, to make him </p>
<p>more palatable to certain Western liberal values have failed to persuade a </p>
<p>number of commentators, including this one.</p>
