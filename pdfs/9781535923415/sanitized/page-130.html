<p>Fusing the Horizons: Faith and Righteousness</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>life of Abraham shows that the faith through which he was initially reckoned </p>
<p>righteous (Gen 15:6) was imperfect (e.g., 16:2). Nevertheless, over the years </p>
<p>it grew to the place where he could offer up the promised seed in obedience </p>
<p>to the God he trusted (22:10–12). Initial justiﬁcation and transformation is </p>
<p>obviously crucial, but it is only the beginning of God’s plan to display his </p>
<p>righteousness in those who depend on him.</p>
<p>Zeal in itself is no guarantee of pleasing God (cf. 8:8; 10:2–3). Even </p>
<p>actions offered by one generation or person in sincere devotion to God can </p>
<p>become for another routine legalism once severed from the motivation of the </p>
<p>Spirit. That is why churches born out of passion for God can become legalistic </p>
<p>or complacent in the next generation when they continue their forebears’ be-</p>
<p>havior without cultivating their relationship with God.</p>
<p>Many are skeptical of Paul’s claim here. Church history reveals that the </p>
<p>church, at least on a large-scale political level, has often lived no differently </p>
<p>than nonbelievers (and in some cases worse). But then, Paul’s theology may </p>
<p>have been largely untested because it has been largely untaught; emphasizing </p>
<p>either moralism or justiﬁcation without transformation truncates Paul’s mes-</p>
<p>sage of unity with Christ. Western Christendom today has imbibed the radical </p>
<p>Enlightenment’s skepticism of the supernatural, suspicious of miracles and </p>
other divine interventions. For Paul, however, the genuine Christian life is “supernatural” (i.e., divinely empowered) from start to ﬁnish, a life by God’s
<p>own Spirit. Apart from acknowledging and embracing the Spirit, the best imi-</p>
<p>tations of Pauline religion are just “ﬂesh.”</p>
<p>Present Suering, Future Glory (8:18–30)</p>
<p>e suerings of the present age</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>were not comparable with the future</p>
<p>glory (8:18), which would somehow be proportional to it (cf. 2 Cor 4:17).</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e glory could evoke God’s presence in the wilderness (cf. 8:14; 9:4);</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>especially involves God’s eschatological revelation of glory (Isa 66:18–19), </p>
<p>particularly the glorifying of his people (Rom 5:2; 8:21, 30; 9:23; 1 ess </p>
<p>2:12; Isa 55:5; 60:1–2; 62:2).</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Paul elsewhere describes the resurrection</p>
<p>18. Paul thinks of the “birth pangs” of the coming age (8:22), probably related to the </p>
<p>Jewish expectation of suering before the end (see comment on 8:22).</p>
<p>19. For the principle, cf. also Wis 3:4–5; 2 Bar. 15:8; 19:7; 48:50; m. ’Abot 5:23; Sipre </p>
<p>Deut. 307.3.2–3; 310.4.1.</p>
<p>20. Exodus depicts the pillar and cloud (Exod 13:21–22), but Jewish tradition spoke </p>
<p>also of God’s “glory” (1 En. 89:22) and “presence” (shekinah; Mek. Shir. 3.67–70).</p>
<p>21. Cf. also Sib. Or. 3.282; 4 Ezra 7:98.</p>
