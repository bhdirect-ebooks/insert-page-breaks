<p>Closing of Romans</p>
<p>183</p>
<p>be called on to explain elements if questions arose.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>ey should welcome</p>
<p>her, reciprocating her own hospitality to others (16:2).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>What does the passage reveal about her status?</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> First, she is a diako-</p>
<p>nos of the Cenchrea church (16:1). Paul can employ this term quite gener-</p>
<p>ally (cf. a possibly related gi in 12:7). e title encompasses the ministry </p>
<p>of Jesus (15:8), Paul (Rom 15:25; 2 Cor 3:6; 6:4; 11:23; Col 1:23–25), and </p>
<p>his companions (Col 1:7). When employed for an oce, it seems distinct </p>
<p>from overseers (Phil 1:1; cf. 1 Tim 3:1–13), but Paul does not dene it, nor </p>
<p>is the “oce” sense his usual usage. It thus seems safest to claim merely </p>
<p>that she was a minister of some sort without dening the character of her </p>
<p>ministry more specically. If the oce of diakonos was related to those in </p>
<p>charge of the synagogue building, this role might relate to her function </p>
<p>as patron of a house congregation, but we lack sucient information to </p>
<p>be certain.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Second, she has been a prostatis to many. Most scholars concur that </p>
<p>this term designates her as a “patron.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>We know of many women patrons,</p>
<p>though they were a minority;</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> the most common independent, property-</p>
<p>owning women might be widows, but others could also ll this role. In </p>
<p>any case, she likely hosts the house congregation in Cenchrea,</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>giving her</p>
<p>some inuence there, and probably had a home of ample size. Given the </p>
<p>mercantile character of Cenchrea, she may be traveling to Rome on busi-</p>
<p>5. As with other bearers (Xenophon Cyr. 4.5.34). Travelers oen supplemented letters </p>
<p>with oral information (e.g., Cicero Fam. 1.6.1; 3.1.1; 9.2.1; 12.30.3; cf. Danker 1989: 109).</p>
<p>6. See Winter 2001: 202.</p>
<p>7. Although Corinth was a Roman colony, the citizens of which were Romans, </p>
<p>Phoebe’s name is Greek; if she were a Roman citizen, Paul might have used one of her </p>
<p>Roman names, as he uses his own.</p>
<p>8. e oce of “deacon” is clearer in later texts (e.g., 1 Clem. 42.4–5; Did. 15.1; Ign. </p>
<p>Eph. 2.1; Ign. Mag. 2.1; 6.1; 13.1; cf. possibly the feminine ministra in Pliny Ep. 10.96.8).</p>
<p>9. E.g., White 2003: 467. Prostatis could evoke the spiritual gi of leading (proistēmi) </p>
<p>in 12:8, as it derives from that verb (cf. the cognate prostatēs, including in the lxx); </p>
<p>but most oen it designates simply patron. Patrons and hosts were not necessarily lead-</p>
<p>ers (Lampe 2003b: 497; though cf. Lane 1998: 210), though in the plural leadership of </p>
<p>the small house churches hosts (who would tend to have more means and education) </p>
<p>probably oen proved inuential. For women patrons of house churches, see Osiek and </p>
<p>MacDonald 2006: 194–220; many pagans found this heavy involvement of women ob-</p>
<p>jectionable (MacDonald 2003: 184; Cook 2002: 113–14, 166–67).</p>
<p>10. E.g., Hemelrijk 2004 (for cities); Winter 2001: 199–201; benefactresses in Forbis </p>
<p>1990; among synagogue patrons, White 1996–97: 1:81.</p>
<p>11. On Cenchrea, see e.g., Rothaus 2000: 64–83; Scranton, Shaw, and Ibrahim 1978.</p>
