<p>Romans 15:14–33</p>
<p>180</p>
<p>similarly-sized Jewish groups could boast an analogous proportion of </p>
<p>Gentile converts that might be construed as the beginning of the eschato-</p>
<p>logical harvest of Gentiles.</p>
<p>Paul employs a variety of terms like “service” and “sharing,”</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> view-</p>
<p>ing this economic help as ministry. Despite Paul’s earlier concern (2 Cor </p>
<p>8:11; 9:3–4), Corinth (leading the province of Achaia) has joined the </p>
<p>Macedonian churches (including Philippi and essalonica) in support-</p>
<p>ing Paul’s collection. Paul must guratively “x his seal” on the collection </p>
<p>(Rom 15:28); business texts used such language for securing containers to </p>
<p>prevent loss (as commentators oen note), but also for attesting or certi-</p>
<p>fying something’s content.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>In 15:30 Paul solicits prayers (as in 2 Cor 1:11; Phil 1:19; 1 ess </p>
<p>5:25; 2 ess 3:1; Phlm 22), in this case for protection in Judea and that </p>
<p>the Jerusalem church will welcome the oering (Rom 15:31). Some doubt </p>
<p>that the church accepted his oering, but that suspicion seems misplaced. </p>
<p>Rejecting a gi was culturally tantamount to declaring enmity,</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>and the</p>
<p>leaders of the Jerusalem church had initially requested such help (Gal </p>
<p>2:10). Luke probably makes little of the collection in Acts (24:17) sim-</p>
<p>ply because it was not relevant in his day. Paul’s concern of hostility in </p>
<p>Jerusalem, however, seems to have materialized. e mention of the “dis-</p>
<p>obedient” in Judea recalls Paul’s understanding that Scripture predicted </p>
<p>this disobedience (Rom 10:21) and that it remained part of God’s plan for </p>
<p>all humanity (11:30–32).</p>
<p>Only success and safety in Jerusalem would guarantee Paul’s ability </p>
<p>to proceed with the following mission in the west, when Paul could nd </p>
<p>“rest” among them (15:32; for such hospitality, cf. 1 Cor 16:18; 2 Cor 7:13; </p>
<p>Phlm 7). As it turned out, from Luke’s subsequent perspective, God spared </p>
<p>Paul’s life and got him to Rome despite and ultimately even by means of </p>
<p>hostility in Jerusalem (Acts 21–28). Paul elsewhere invokes the “God of </p>
<p>“some” (11:14), and anticipated opposition (15:30–32). Rather than expecting his col-</p>
<p>lection to consummate history, he hoped to visit Rome aerward (15:24). His mission </p>
<p>played a part in Israel’s salvation, but not the entire role.</p>
<p>43. For an even wider array of terms, see 2 Cor 8–9 (e.g., 9:1); Dahl 1977: 37–38. Such </p>
diverse terminology ts epigraphic conventions (Harrison 2003: 300).
<p>44. E.g., 1 Cor 9:2; Aelius Aristides Defense of Oratory 340, §112D (guratively); cf. </p>
<p>Deissmann 1923: 238–39.</p>
<p>45. Marshall 1987: 13–21. At the least it displayed contempt (Pliny Ep. 8.6.9).</p>
