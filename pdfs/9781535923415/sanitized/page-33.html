<p>Synthesizing Various Factors</p>
<p>Part of the debate depends on the meaning of “legalism” and “works righ-</p>
<p>teousness.” us, Sanders would point out that the nt sources themselves </p>
<p>oen speak of reward and even eternal salvation on the basis of works, </p>
<p>yet in the larger context of God’s covenant grace. With some critics, one </p>
<p>helpful approach to the varied evidence of Jewish sources is to recognize </p>
that diverse approaches existed, a variety that many teachers never sought
<p>to harmonize and Judaism as a whole certainly could not harmonize. It is </p>
<p>indeed hard to imagine otherwise. For example, despite the heavy teach-</p>
<p>ing on grace in the New Testament, many Christians today are what other </p>
<p>Christians would consider “legalistic.”</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Ancient Judaism surely included</p>
<p>its share of this sort of “legalism,” too, whatever the approach of those </p>
<p>who most emphasized grace. (We did, aer all, open this section by af-</p>
rming the diversity of ancient Judaism in many other respects.)
<p>Aside from this question, we should also allow for some other fac-</p>
<p>tors when hearing Paul. First, Paul is ready to use reductio ad absurdum </p>
<p>where necessary (cf. e.g., Rom 2:17–24); ancient polemic could focus </p>
<p>on a weakness in an opposing position that its supporters might not re-</p>
<p>gard as fundamental to or characteristic of the position. Moreover, the </p>
<p>center of Paul’s argument is not simply any gracious act, but God’s grace </p>
<p>specically in Christ, which was for Paul (and for other Christians) the </p>
<p>climax of salvic history. is specic understanding of grace informs the </p>
<p>distinction of his position from that of contemporaries who rejected his </p>
<p>understanding of Christ. Finally, Paul is oen addressing not Judaism as </p>
<p>a whole, but (especially in Galatians) the demands of some fellow Jewish </p>
<p>Christians who sought to accommodate the strictest Jewish expectations </p>
<p>for full converts to Judaism. It was the status of Gentile converts that </p>
<p>generated the conict most starkly (hence the increased prominence of </p>
<p>righteousness by faith in letters addressing Gentile believers’ relation to </p>
<p>Judaism).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>us, most Jews welcomed Gentile interest in Judaism and even </p>
<p>armed the future “salvation” of monotheistic, sexually pure Gentiles, </p>
<p>yet believed that sharing in Israel’s covenant required circumcision and </p>
<p>acceptance of the law, including those parts specic to Israel. Jews could </p>
<p>11. Historically, cf. e.g., Vidler 1974: 279.</p>
<p>12. Many have noted this greater prominence in Romans and Galatians (cf. also </p>
<p>Ephesians), especially since Stendahl 1976 (esp. 2–4).</p>
