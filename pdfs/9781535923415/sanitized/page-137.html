<p>Life in Christ and the Spirit</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>Believers need not fear external criticism against their relationship </p>
<p>with God (8:31, 33), for example, for not keeping some external details </p>
<p>of the law like physical circumcision (2:26–29). e condent question </p>
<p>of 8:31 evokes especially Ps 118:6: God is for me, so what can humans do </p>
<p>to me?</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>In 8:32, Paul echoes his earlier assurance that if God loved his</p>
<p>people to the extent of Christ dying for them, how much greater would </p>
<p>be the benet of his resurrection (5:8–10)? He also echoes God delivering </p>
<p>over Jesus (4:25; cf. 1 Cor 11:23; Gal 2:20),</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>believers being God’s heirs</p>
<p>(8:17), and perhaps believers’ rule of the coming world (4:13; 5:17). In </p>
<p>8:33–34a Paul echoes Isa 50:8: God vindicates (“justies,” using dikaioō) </p>
<p>me; who will contend with me? Who dares to bring a legal case against </p>
<p>me?</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>If God as judge has already acquitted believers in Jesus (who died</p>
<p>for them, and even more</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>rose), accusers raise accusations only at their</p>
<p>own peril. e mention of God’s “chosen” recalls 8:29–30 and emphasizes </p>
<p>God’s favor. Paul concludes 8:34 by showing that believers’ vindication is </p>
<p>surely settled, for Jesus (whose death and resurrection justied believers, </p>
<p>3:24; 4:25; 5:9) intercedes just as the Spirit does (8:26). Jesus’s location at </p>
<p>God’s right hand indicates his exaltation (Ps 110:1), presumably including </p>
<p>over hostile powers (Rom 8:38–39), and emphasizes his complete access </p>
<p>to the one with whom he intercedes.</p>
<p>Now Paul oers a brief but fairly obvious chiasm:</p>
<p>A Nothing can separate believers from Christ’s love (8:35a)</p>
<p> B List of suerings (8:35b)</p>
<p> C Believers thoroughly overcome (8:37)</p>
<p> B´ List of suerings (8:38–39a)</p>
<p>A´ Nothing can separate believers from God’s love in Christ (8:39)</p>
<p>49. More generally, God oen arms that he is with and for his servants (e.g., Gen </p>
<p>26:3, 24; 28:15; 31:3; Jer 20:11; cf. T. Iss. 7:7); God ghts for his people in Exod 14:14, 25. </p>
<p>In view of the quotation in Rom 8:33–34, cf. perhaps especially Isa 50:7.</p>
<p>50. Paul employed this verb paradidōmi earlier for Jesus’s death in a context referring </p>
<p>to Abraham, but not expressly mentioning the Aqedah. Many scholars, however, do see </p>
<p>an allusion to Abraham oering up Isaac here; whether or not they are correct, such an </p>
<p>analogy at the least displays the costliness of the sacrice.</p>
<p>51. Paul changes lxx Is ai ah’s krinō to katakrinō, but he seems to have been using </p>
<p>these interchangeably (cf. Rom 2:1, 3, 12, 16, 27; 3:4–7; 5:16, 18; 8:1, 3). Paul may use </p>
<p>hupophora (where one asks what can be said against one’s case; Rhet. Her. 4.23.33).</p>
<p>52. “Yea, rather” is not so much an aerthought but a common rhetorical technique </p>
<p>(e.g., Rhet. Her. 4.26.36; Pliny Ep. 7.31.7; cf. Rowe 1997: 141). For the thought, cf. 5:9.</p>
