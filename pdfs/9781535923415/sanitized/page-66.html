<p>Fusing the Horizons: Homosexual Activity</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>At the same time, we must not exaggerate what Paul is saying. He uses </p>
<p>the examples of idolatry and homosexual behavior because Jewish people rec-</p>
<p>ognized these as exclusively Gentile vices. This recognition plays into Paul’s </p>
<p>strategy to expose all sin as deadly (1:28–32), hence all persons as sinners </p>
<p>(3:23). Paul is not providing pastoral counsel here to believers struggling </p>
<p>with homosexual temptation, and he is certainly not granting license to abuse </p>
<p>those who practice homosexual behavior. (Nor would he grant license to de-</p>
<p>nounce this vice while tolerating heterosexual behavior outside marriage, a </p>
<p>condemnation that consumes considerably more space in his letters.) Given </p>
<p>how common bisexual practice was, Paul undoubtedly worked closely with </p>
<p>many believers who had come from this background (some of whom were still </p>
<p>tempted by it; cf. the likeliest interpretation of arsenokoite¯s in 1 Cor 6:9–11). </p>
<p>Paul’s message here would be more analogous to a preacher appealing to an </p>
<p>audience on the basis of their shared values regarding homosexual behavior—</p>
<p>then leading them to consider their own vices.</p>
<p>Various Vices (1:28–32)</p>
<p>For the third time (cf. 1:24, 26), in 1:28 Paul repeats the refrain that </p>
<p>God “gave them over” to their own ways through their minds being cor-</p>
<p>rupted (cf. 1:21–22). ey did not “approve” (from dokimazō) God in </p>
<p>their knowledge, so God gave them “unapproved” (adokimos) minds to </p>
<p>do “untting” things.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>For Paul, humanity’s distortion of the truth about</p>
<p>God’s character leads to their distortion of the purpose of human sexual-</p>
<p>ity, and ultimately to every kind of vice. As he will point out later, though, </p>
<p>retaining true knowledge about God’s standards by the law makes one </p>
<p>responsible for sin, rather than saving one (2:20; 7:23–25; 8:5–8).</p>
<p>Paul then lists examples of the “untting” things produced by this </p>
<p>depraved mind, what he will later call the perspective of the esh (8:5–8). </p>
<p>Ancient moralists commonly used vice lists,</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>sometimes arranged with</p>
<p>repetitions to rhetorically drive home the point. Paul’s is longer than aver-</p>
<p>99. Paul’s “untting” may reect Stoic terminology, alluding to people acting against </p>
<p>nature (1:26–27); but the particular examples of “untting things” here unfold in </p>
<p>1:29–31.</p>
<p>100. E.g., Ezek 18:6–8, 11–13; Philo Posterity 52; Sacrices 32; Plato Laws 1.649D; </p>
<p>Aristotle Eth. eud. 2.3.4, 1220b–21a; Cicero Pis. 27.66; idem Cat. 2.4.7; 2.5.10; 2.10.22, </p>
<p>25; Seneca Dial. 9.2.10–12.</p>
