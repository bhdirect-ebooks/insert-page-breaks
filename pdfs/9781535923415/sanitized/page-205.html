<p>e collection for the poor believers</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> in Jerusalem was in fact a ma-</p>
<p>jor concern in this phase of Paul’s ministry (1 Cor 16:1–4; 2 Cor 8—9; cf. </p>
<p>Gal 2:10). While most passages concerning the collection stress concern </p>
<p>for the recipients’ needs and God’s glory, this passage illumines another </p>
<p>aspect of his motivation: Gentile or mixed Diaspora churches showing </p>
<p>their appreciation for the Jerusalem church. Ancient Mediterranean cul-</p>
<p>ture emphasized the obligation of reciprocity (cf. note on 1:12), which </p>
<p>involved repayment, but not in kind (e.g., one repaid economic benefac-</p>
<p>tors with honor, not money; cf. Paul’s adaptation of the principle in 2 Cor </p>
<p>9:11–15).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>us Paul speaks of Gentiles’ spiritual “debt” to those in whose </p>
<p>spiritual blessings (such as are listed in Rom 9:4–5, many elements of </p>
<p>which Paul elsewhere attributes to all believers) they now share.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>Some</p>
<p>have compared the collection to the annual temple tax from the Diaspora </p>
<p>to Jerusalem (a comparison that explains the mechanics better than </p>
<p>the motivation).</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>Some have also compared the Jewish expectation of</p>
<p>Gentiles bringing tribute to Jerusalem in the end time (Isa 45:14; 60:6–10; </p>
<p>66:20), which might be how the Jerusalem church could have viewed the </p>
<p>oering.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p> Such a signicant symbol of unity might help reduce the slan-</p>
<p>ders that Paul’s mission was not producing true converts to Israel’s faith </p>
<p>(cf. Acts 21:21; Gal 5:11–12). Indeed, Paul’s “ministry” to Jerusalem (Rom </p>
<p>15:31) was linked to his “ministry” to Gentiles (11:13); very possibly he </p>
<p>hoped to provoke his people to jealousy, hence hopefully contribute to </p>
<p>their turning and the consummation of God’s plan (11:14–15).</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>No other</p>
<p>38. Like Qumran sectarians, the Jerusalem church could call itself “the saints”; but </p>
<p>Paul calls the believers in Rome “saints” also (1:7). Again on the analogy of Qumran </p>
<p>(e.g., 1QM 11.9, 13; 13.14; 14.7; 1QpHab 12.3, 6, 10), some have viewed “the poor” as a </p>
<p>label for the Jerusalem church (cf. Fitzmyer 1966: 244; Hengel 1974: 34), but the parallels </p>
<p>seem inadequate (Keck 1966) and Paul’s language here does not identify the poor as </p>
<p>coextensive with all Jerusalem’s saints. On the poor in early Judaism, see e.g., Hoyt 1974: </p>
<p>13–61; as a character type in the lxx, see Roth 1997: 112–32.</p>
<p>39. Contrast Paul’s “debt” to Gentiles (Rom 1:14; see comment there) based on his </p>
<p>call (1:1).</p>
<p>40. See especially Nickle 1966: 75–93 (noting also dierences). For motivation, see </p>
<p>early Jewish and Christian concern for the poor in Watson 2006.</p>
<p>41. In an economic context, leitourgeō could connote economic levies on wealthy </p>
individuals (Bell 1966: 301–2; Llewelyn and Kearsley 1994: 93–105), but in the context of
<p>leitourgos in 15:16 (where it is linked with hierourgeō) it might bear priestly connotations </p>
<p>(see also Llewelyn and Kearsley 1994: 105–11).</p>
<p>42. With e.g., Donaldson 1997b: 252. Against some, however, this should not be </p>
<p>understood in terms of unrealistic utopian expectation; Paul hoped to be able to save </p>
