<p>Romans 8:1–17</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>Spirit that is the agent of life, and the hope is not disembodiment but </p>
<p>nally bodily resurrection.</p>
<p>To be “led” by God’s Spirit (8:14) means at least partly to have the </p>
<p>Spirit-inspired perspective that produces righteousness and life (8:4–6, </p>
<p>13; cf. Gal 5:18 with 5:16–23). Undoubtedly it also means that God’s Spirit </p>
<p>speaks to one, assuring one of one’s relationship to God (8:15–16). e </p>
<p>wording may particularly evoke the image of the exodus: God not only </p>
<p>gave his people the law (8:2), but “led” them by his glory in the wilder-</p>
<p>ness.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>He led them in this way during the interim period between their</p>
<p>redemption from Egypt and their entrance to their “inheritance” in the </p>
<p>promised land, language he further evokes here (8:17).</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Believers can</p>
<p>trust God to lead their lives (not only morally, but more generally) in this </p>
<p>period of interim existence.</p>
<p>e spirit of slavery (8:15) contrasts with the Spirit of the exodus just </p>
<p>evoked in 8:14. As God adopted Israel in the exodus (9:4; Exod 4:22), so </p>
<p>in 8:15–16 the Spirit assures believers (including Gentile believers) that </p>
<p>they are God’s children.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>e Spirit is associated with believers as God’s</p>
<p>children in the future, because the Spirit will raise their bodies (8:10–11), </p>
<p>hence revealing them as God’s children (8:19–23, especially 23). But the </p>
<p>Spirit provides believers a foretaste of that destiny (8:23), conrming their </p>
<p>state as God’s children in the present. Because the Spirit was oen associ-</p>
<p>ated with prophecy,</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>the Spirit of Christ both inspires believers to cry out</p>
<p>with Christ in their relationship to the Father in him (8:15), and inspires </p>
<p>them to hear God’s fatherhood toward them (8:16).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>It seems doubtful</p>
<p>12. E.g., Exod 13:21; 15:13; Bar 2:11; Wis 10:17–18; 1 En. 89:22; Sib. Or. 3.255; 4 Ezra </p>
<p>14:4. For the Spirit and the exodus, cf. Isa 63:11; Hag 2:5; Mek. Besh. 3.82–83.</p>
<p>13. For exodus language in this paragraph, see e.g., Keesmat 1999. Aer Paul’s day it </p>
<p>became clear that the interim between Jesus’s comings may have stretched longer than </p>
<p>that between stages of salvation in the exodus; nevertheless it oered an analogy for an </p>
<p>interim time.</p>
<p>14. A traditional title of Israel (e.g., Hos 11:1; Ps. Sol. 17:27; Sib. Or. 3.702–4; Sipre </p>
<p>Deut. 43.16.1; 45.1.2; 96.4.1; 308.1.2); for the language of God’s children in Jewish and </p>
<p>other sources, see Keener 2003b: 400–2.</p>
<p>15. Menzies 2004: 49–101; idem 1991: 53–112; Turner 1996: 86–104 (including in-</p>
<p>spired wisdom and praise); Keener 1997: 10–13, 31–33. On the Spirit “inspiring” the </p>
<p>“Abba” cry and other speech here, see Dunn 1999: 82, 85–87, 89–91.</p>
<p>16. Given the context of inheritance, “witness” might evoke witnesses to a will (Gaius </p>
<p>Inst. 2.104–8), but in any case constitutes strong assurance, and may be conventional </p>
<p>early Christian language (cf. Heb 10:15; 1 John 5:7–8; John 15:26; Rev 19:10), which Paul </p>
<p>also associates with conscience (Rom 2:15; 9:1).</p>
