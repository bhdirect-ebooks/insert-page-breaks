not need to reach every individual; he believed that once an indigenous
<p>church was founded, it could reach its own culture.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>Paul in 15:21 provides a biblical argument for this agenda from Isa </p>
<p>52:15, a context he knows well (Isa 52:7 in Rom 10:15; Isa 53:1 in Rom </p>
<p>10:16).</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>e immediate context involves God’s suering servant (Isa</p>
<p>52:13—53:12), and Paul chooses the one verse of the passage that speci-</p>
<p>cally refers to Gentiles coming to know (52:15), a verse that coheres with </p>
<p>his interpretation of Isa 65:1 in Rom 10:20 (where God is found by some </p>
<p>who did not seek him). e Gentile response in 52:15 contrasted with </p>
<p>Israel’s negative response to the servant in 53:1–3—which Paul quoted in </p>
<p>Rom 10:16.</p>
<p>Paul now explains both his plans to visit them (15:23–24, 28–29) </p>
<p>and the one remaining mission that will delay him a bit longer before he </p>
<p>can come (15:25–27). Paul’s mission to the unevangelized will take him to </p>
<p>Spain (15:24, 28), allowing him to visit Rome en route (15:23–24, 28–29). </p>
<p>(We should keep in mind that ancient travel took time, and it would also </p>
<p>incur great expense, especially given Paul’s standard practice of bringing </p>
<p>fellow workers.) Spain was part of the Latin west, closely connected with </p>
<p>Rome,</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>so Paul would undoubtedly start in the Roman colonies in Spain,</p>
<p>where Latin was spoken.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> Whereas he had normally started in syna-</p>
<p>gogues where available (e.g., 2 Cor 11:24; Acts 13:5), in Spain he might </p>
<p>have to break further new ground, because so far we have little evidence </p>
<p>for a signicant number of Jews in Spain during this period.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>His connection of his visit to the Roman believers with the Spanish </p>
<p>mission functions partly as a polite form of request; to be “sent on his </p>
<p>way” (15:24) implies not only provision while in Rome but also at least </p>
<p>his ship fare to Spain. Nevertheless, such hospitality was a treasured value </p>
<p>29. Cf. Bornkamm 1971: 54.</p>
<p>30. Perhaps Paul also presupposes Isa 52:1 in Rom 13:11–12, though the language is </p>
<p>too vague to suggest a deliberate allusion the ideal audience should have grasped.</p>

<p>32. Cf. Ramsay 1910: 276; Garnsey and Saller 1987: 186. Paul’s Roman citizenship </p>
<p>(Acts 16:37) would not guarantee any prociency in Latin, but he would have had op-</p>
<p>portunity for further exposure in Corinth.</p>

<p>he reached Spain is fairly likely (1 Clem. 5.7; cf. later Muratorian Canon 38–39), but most </p>
<p>traditions of the actual visit are later (Meinardus 1978).</p>
