<p>Romans 9</p>
<p>Israel’s Role and Salvation (9:1—11:36)</p>
<p>Some scholars in the past treated Rom 9–11 as a digression (or even an </p>
<p>interpolation from another context), but few share that view today. Far </p>
<p>from being a digression, these chapters pick up the issue of Israel ad-</p>
<p>dressed in 3:1–9 (from which Paul in a sense digressed to address the </p>
<p>relationship between righteousness and the law). Paul has been address-</p>
<p>ing the relationship between Jew and Gentile in Christ throughout (1:16; </p>
<p>2:9–10, 13–14; 3:9, 29; 4:10–12), and now must deal with the biblical </p>
<p>evidence concerning God’s purposes in history concerning Israel and the </p>
<p>covenant.</p>
<p>Israel Special and Beloved (9:1–5)</p>
<p>In 9:1–3 Paul shis rhetorically from the height of celebration to the </p>
<p>deepest lament. Once Paul has begun addressing God choosing people </p>
<p>(8:29–30), he has reminded his audience that he has not le the Jewish-</p>
<p>Gentile issue that has dominated his letter. If believers are adopted, </p>
<p>promised glory (8:18, 21, 30), and have the law in their hearts (8:2), what </p>
<p>shall one say about ethnic Israel, to whom such blessings were already </p>
<p>promised (9:4–5)? If nothing can tear the objects of God’s love from him </p>
<p>(8:35–39), what has happened to Israel, who has occupied this position </p>
<p>historically? Paul answers abundantly from Scripture—in fact, over 27 </p>
<p>percent of explicit citations in extant Pauline letters appear in Rom 9–11.</p>
<p>Perhaps Paul’s lament in 9:1–3 includes some hyperbole, or perhaps </p>
<p>it reects Paul’s mood before his perilous journey to Jerusalem (15:31); </p>
<p>he elsewhere speaks much of rejoicing (12:12, 15; 14:17; 15:13, 32; 16:19; </p>
<p>Phil 1:18; 4:4). Paul’s understanding of emotion allowed him to combine </p>
<p>both elements (2 Cor 6:10).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>What we can feel secure in saying is that Paul</p>
<p>1. Sorrow and tears could be used rhetorically to stir an audience (e.g., Cicero Mil. </p>
