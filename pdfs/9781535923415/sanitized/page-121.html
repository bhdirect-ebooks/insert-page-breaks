<p>somed. e anguished persona in this text cries out, “Wretched person </p>
<p>that I am!”</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>needing deliverance from the “body of death” (a body under</p>
<p>the sentence of and destined for death, 7:24; 8:10).</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>e answer, no less exclamatory, comes in 7:25. Paul oen says, </p>
<p>“anks be to God!” when commenting on freedom from sin or death </p>
<p>(6:17; 1 Cor 15:57; cf. 2 Cor 2:14; 8:16; 9:15),</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>and sometimes when</p>
<p>concluding a section, as here (1 Cor 15:57; 2 Cor 9:15), but the addi-</p>
<p>tion of “through Jesus Christ our Lord” sounds like an implied answer </p>
<p>to the lament of 7:24. Before treating this victory, however (in 8:1–17), </p>
<p>Paul summarizes the state of aairs: the mind may serve God’s law, but </p>
<p>the esh submits to the law as exploited by sin (7:7–9). His mention of </p>
<p>the mind serving God’s law probably points to its unfullled desire to do </p>
<p>right (7:16, 22–23), hence still refers to the perspective dominated by the </p>
<p>esh (8:5–7); alternatively but less likely, it might refer to the perspective </p>
<p>of the Spirit that contrasts with the eshly perspective (8:5–7).</p>
<p>Excursus: The “Flesh” (sarx) in Romans</p>
<p>Neoplatonic and gnostic dualism absorbed by later Christianity denied that </p>
<p>the body was good,</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> and many scholars today, reacting against this concep-</p>
<p>tion, argue that Paul’s use of sarx bears little relation to so¯ma, “body.” Some </p>

<p>29. Characteristic of tragic laments (e.g., Aeschylus Ag. 1260; cf. Ovid Metam. 9.474; </p>
<p>Apuleius Metam. 3.25); some applied “wretched” to the bodily state (Epictetus Disc. </p>
<p>1.3.5–6; 1.9.12).</p>
<p>30. Some envisioned the soul as a prisoner within the body, hence death as a release </p>
<p>from suering or limitation (Cicero Tusc. 1.31.75; Epictetus Disc. 1.9.16; Maximus of </p>
<p>Tyre Or. 7.5; Heraclitus Ep. 5, who describes the body as “dead”; cf. Philo Alleg. Interp. </p>
<p>1.108); cf. “this dead body” in Epictetus Disc. 2.19.27 (cf. Marcus Aurelius Med. 10.33.3). </p>
<p>Some answered the question, “Who will release me?” with suicide (Diogenes Laertius </p>
<p>6.18, 21).</p>
<p>31. e phrase is not, however, uniquely Paul’s (Epictetus Disc. 4.4.7; Ps.-Crates Ep. </p>
<p>33; Ps.-Diogenes Ep. 34).</p>
<p>32. Cf. Philostratus Vit.Apoll. 7.26; Iamblichus Pyth. 31.205; Plotinus Enn. 1.8; </p>
<p>2.4; 3.6.6–7; Porphyry Marc. 10.176; 13.227–29; 14.242–50; 25.394–95; 33.506–9; </p>

<p>tites, in Plato Phaedo 66CD; Seneca Dial. 7.8.2; idem Ep. Lucil. 8.5; Epictetus Disc. 1.3.3; </p>
