<p>Made Right by Trusting Christ</p>

<p>age, though far briefer than some. His rhetorical repetition and variation </p>
<p>makes the list all the more eective: “lled with” four basic evils; “full </p>
<p>of” ve sins; a summary of eight kinds of sinners; and deciency in four </p>
<p>positive traits (1:29–31).</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>Whereas Jewish people could relegate idolatry</p>
<p>and homosexual intercourse to the corrupted ideologies of Gentiles, the </p>
<p>present sins also appear in lists of Jewish misbehavior: envy, strife, gossip, </p>
<p>slander, arrogance, disobedience to parents, and so forth. By the end of </p>
<p>his list, Paul has inductively convicted both Jews and Gentiles as being </p>
<p>under sin (he might do so deductively in 3:9–19), paving the way for his </p>
<p>argument in ch. 2.</p>
<p>Paul shows that humanity rightly stands under the sentence of death </p>
<p>(1:32). For though they technically should know better (1:19–20; cf. 2:14–</p>
<p>15), they do what they know to be worthy of death (the way of the eshly </p>
<p>worldview, which yields death, 8:6).</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>ose who refused to approve God</p>
<p>in their thinking (1:28) now approve others who share their own behavior </p>
<p>(1:32). God’s “righteous standard” or “requirement,”</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>however, demands</p>
<p>capital punishment for all transgressors, whether idolaters or gossipers </p>
<p>and (most relevant for Paul’s continuing argument in 2:17, 23; 3:27, albeit </p>
<p>with dierent terminology) boasters.</p>
<p>101. Lists could either use repeated conjunctions (e.g., “and . . . and”; 1 Cor 6:9–10; 2 </p>
<p>Cor 12:21; Acts 15:20) or no conjunctions (asyndeton), as here (cf. Gal 5:19–23).</p>
<p>102. Even from the era of the “beginning” (1:20) they knew (cf. Gen 3:3) that human </p>
<p>death was the consequence of humanity’s sin (Rom 5:12, 14, 17, 21; 6:16, 21, 23; 7:5, </p>
<p>13). is was even more true for knowers of the law (cf. 2:26; 8:4). Jewish teachers also </p>
<p>believed that God had given commandments to humanity before the law (Jub. 7:20–21; </p>
<p>Ps.-Phoc. passim; what the later rabbis called Noahide commandments, e.g., Mek. Bah. </p>
<p>5.90–94; Sipre Deut. 343.4.1).</p>
<p>103. Dikaiōma. God’s righteous character is thus also revealed in his wrath (1:18), </p>
<p>though especially in the gospel where he puts people in the right (1:17); the tension is </p>
<p>resolved especially in 3:26.</p>
