<p>Romans 5:12–21</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>Reversing the Fall (5:12–21)</p>
<p>In chapter 4, Paul has argued against depending on ethnic descent from </p>
<p>Abraham. Now he reminds his biblically informed audience that all </p>
<p>people are descended from Adam. A Jewish audience might concur with </p>
<p>his condemnation of those in solidarity with Adam, provided he excluded </p>
<p>those in ethnic solidarity with Abraham.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Yet for Paul, it is apparently</p>
<p>behavior or choices, more than genetics, that identies one’s solidarity; </p>
<p>he addresses those who believe like Abraham, who sin like Adam, or who </p>
<p>are baptized into Christ (cf. 6:3). Paul arms clearly that death entered </p>
<p>the world through sin (5:12). ough he makes the contrast with Christ </p>
<p>bringing life (5:15–21, esp. 18–19) only a few verses later, his never-</p>
<p>completed “just as” (hōsper) in this verse betrays his plan to address that </p>
<p>issue. Scholars debate the grammar in the last clause of the verse; most, </p>
<p>however, conclude that it says that death pervaded humanity “because” all </p>
<p>sinned (e.g., nasb; nrsv; tniv).</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Other Jewish thinkers agreed that while</p>
<p>Adam introduced sin, and hence death,</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>each of Adam’s descendants has</p>
<p>replicated his sin (4 Ezra 3:21; 2 Bar. 18:1–2; 54:15, 19).</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Paul digresses briey regarding the law in 5:13–14. In 5:13 (cf. 4:15; </p>
<p>5:20) Paul must bring in the law’s condemning function (i.e., the law as a </p>
<p>righteous standard, hence a criterion of judgment) to prepare for his later </p>
<p>14. For the Jewish character of 5:12–21’s content (though Genesis should make that </p>
<p>suciently obvious in terms of the use of “Adam”), see e.g., Davies 1980: 36–57; Scroggs </p>
<p>1966: 18–58; Hultgren 2003.</p>
<p>15. Other possibilities abound (see Fitzmyer 1993: 413–17, who ultimately prefers </p>
<p>“with the result that”). Dependent on Latin translation, Augustine in his later years (in </p>
<p>contrast to earlier and later voices in the Greek church such as Origen, Chrysostom and </p>
<p>eodoret) thought that Adam’s descendants sinned in him and his guilt was passed on </p>
<p>to them. What seems likelier is that, the connection with God having been broken, all </p>
<p>begin alienated from God hence susceptible to sin (cf. perhaps 4 Ezra 3:20–22).</p>
<p>16. E.g., 4 Ezra 3:7; 4:30; 2 Bar. 17:2–3; 23:4; 48:42–45; 56:5–6; L.A.E. 44:3–4; Sipre </p>
<p>Deut. 323.5.1; 339.1.2; cf. Gen 2:17. For Adam’s death being a spiritual death “in passions,” </p>
<p>see Philo Alleg. Interp. 1.106. rough Scripture, Paul was thoroughly familiar with the </p>
<p>ancient Israelite concept of corporate repercussions for sin (on corporate solidarity, see </p>
<p>e.g., Davies 1980: 103–4; Longenecker 1975: 93–94; Grieb 2002: 67; in Adam, e.g., m. </p>
Sanh. 4:5). Whether he conceived Adam as an individual or “as the archetype of ‘every-
<p>man’” (Dunn 1998: 94–95) is theologically less signicant, since it was self-evident that </p>
<p>human sin had been initiated long before and pervaded all humanity (cf. Ambrosiaster </p>
<p>Commentary on Paul’s Epistles on 5:12).</p>
<p>17. Aer blaming the fall on Adam (4 Ezra 7:118–19), a passage goes on to list their </p>
<p>own sins (7:119–26); cf. 1 En. 98:4.</p>
