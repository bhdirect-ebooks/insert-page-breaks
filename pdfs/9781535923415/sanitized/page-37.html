<p>Introduction</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Over half of Rome’s Jews have Latin names.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> A large number prob-</p>
<p>ably descended from Jewish slaves originally brought to Rome by Pompey </p>
<p>over a century earlier, then bought and freed by Jews already living in </p>
<p>Rome (Philo Embassy 155). Although many remained predominantly </p>
<p>Greek speaking even by this period (over three quarters of their inscrip-</p>
<p>tions are in Greek, and not quite a quarter are in Latin),</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>many were</p>
<p>Roman citizens (Philo Embassy 155). When Roman citizens freed their </p>
<p>slaves under particular conditions, those freed became Roman citizens; </p>
<p>Paul himself may have descended from Jewish slaves freed in Rome (cf. </p>
<p>Acts 6:9; 16:37; 22:28). Certain features made this community ripe for </p>
<p>the spread of the message about Jesus: they were apparently open to the </p>
<p>dominant culture, providing tolerance for new ideas, while their distinc-</p>
<p>tive ethnic status also connected them with other Judeans who followed </p>
<p>Jesus.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Jews oen faced prejudice from the larger Roman soci-</p>
<p>ety.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Rome was tolerant of many cultures in its empire, but many Romans</p>
<p>guarded more jealously their own city’s traditions, and particularly re-</p>
<p>sented Jewish success at winning converts and sympathizers (especially </p>
<p>among Roman matrons). Roman sources explicitly condemn Jews for </p>
<p>circumcision (cf. Rom 2:25–29; 4:9–12), which they viewed as a form of </p>
<p>mutilation; the Sabbath (cf. Rom 14:5-6), which they viewed as an excuse </p>
<p>for laziness (in contrast to Roman market days); and their food customs </p>
<p>(cf. Rom 14:2–23). Under extreme circumstances, the Jewish community </p>
<p>could even face banishment from Rome (see discussion below).</p>
<p>Jewish and Gentile Elements in the Church</p>
<p>e church’s origins in Rome probably stemmed from Jewish believers </p>
<p>there (cf. Acts 2:10),</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> but clearly it spread beyond them. Paul’s audi-</p>
<p>20. Mostly regular Gentile names, including many that recall names of deities (but </p>
<p>without polytheistic intent; they likewise used some Roman decorations, but preferred </p>
<p>distinctive Jewish symbols like the menorah to major Roman ones). Only about 15 per-</p>
<p>cent have traditional Semitic names.</p>
<p>21. Leon 1960: 76.</p>
<p>22. See e.g., Juvenal Sat. 14.100–104; see especially Gager 1983; Sevenster 1975.</p>
<p>23. So also Ambrosiaster in the fourth century, who believed that the founders ex-</p>
<p>pected law observance (Lane 1998: 203). Paul assumes a high degree of biblical literacy </p>
<p>and familiarity with Jewish tradition (though cf. also Galatians), and the many travelers </p>
<p>to the capital carried new ideas there quickly.</p>
