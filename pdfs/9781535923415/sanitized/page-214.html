<p>Romans 16:3–16</p>
<p>188</p>
<p>of Aristobulus” (16:10) refers to slaves and freedpersons of the Herodian </p>
<p>prince Aristobulus, who lived in Rome, though he himself may have died </p>
<p>by this point. (A “household” included slaves and freedpersons.) A Jew </p>
<p>named “Herodion” (16:11) may have also been a slave or freedperson </p>
<p>from the Herodian family. (Slaves in prominent households were oen </p>
<p>well-educated, and could wield signicant power.) Some scholars think </p>
<p>that the “household of Narcissus” (16:11) refers to those attached to the </p>
<p>powerful and wealthy imperial freedman Narcissus. e period and loca-</p>
<p>tion do t, though in the vast city of Rome it is not surprising that there </p>
<p>were other freedpersons and slaveholders with this name.</p>
<p>e matching names “Tryphaena” and “Tryphosa” (16:12) suggest </p>
<p>twin sisters. “Persis” (16:12) was a common name for slaves imported </p>
<p>from Persia, so she may have been a slave or freedwoman. Because Paul </p>
<p>knew Rufus’s mother (16:13),</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>it is plausible that this is the Rufus known</p>
<p>soon aerward to Mark’s possibly Roman audience, the son of Simon </p>
<p>of Cyrene (Mark 15:21). Since Diaspora Jewish believers were scattered </p>
<p>from Jerusalem, and many Cyrenian ones settled in Antioch (Acts 8:4; </p>
<p>11:20), Paul could have known the family there.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>e multiple names in</p>
<p>the two congregations in 16:14, 15 suggest multiple leaders and perhaps </p>
<p>sizeable congregations; Paul may have less personal acquaintance with </p>
these individuals (not even informed as to the name of Nereus’s sister).
<p>Kissing (16:16) was employed for greeting relatives or close friends </p>
<p>in antiquity. ough typically on the mouth, such light kisses were nor-</p>
<p>mally readily distinguishable from the erotic ones emphasized in modern </p>
<p>Western culture.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>(e “holy” kiss species its limits; still, later abuses led</p>
<p>to more explicit restrictions in the churches.) Paul here might practice the </p>
<p>rare but attested custom of secondary kissing, something like “Give so-</p>
<p>and-so a kiss for me.”</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>Whether Paul simply advises believers to kiss each</p>
<p>other, or to convey his kiss greetings, his admonition would help cement </p>
<p>27. For viewing another’s mother as one’s own, see e.g., 1 Tim 5:2; Pseudo-Callisthenes </p>
<p>Alex. 2.20; Horsley 1987: §9, p. 34.</p>
<p>28. Alternatively, a Jerusalem tomb inscription might identify them (e.g., Lane 1974: </p>
<p>563), but the names are too common to be sure.</p>
<p>29. E.g., Ovid Metam. 2. 356–57, 430–31; 10.362, 525; Arrian Alex. 4.11.3; Plutarch </p>
<p>Quaest. rom. 6, Mor. 265B; for further details, see Keener 2000c.</p>
<p>30. A letter’s reader might convey the writer’s kiss to another on behalf of the writer </p>
<p>(Fronto Ad M. Caes. 1.8.7; 5.33 [48]; 5.42 [57]).</p>
