<p>Romans 8:18–30</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>(8:14) and assures believers that they are God’s children (8:16), and also </p>
<p>inspires prayer to God (8:15), though the “prayer” in 8:26 may be one that </p>
<p>believers do not always even recognize. As the Spirit intercedes within </p>
<p>believers (8:26), Jesus intercedes for them at God’s right hand (8:34).</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e Spirit who knows God’s heart (1 Cor 2:11) prays “according to God” </p>
<p>(Rom 8:27), an idiom used elsewhere (cf. 15:5; 2 Cor 7:9–11) for what </p>
<p>accords with God’s will. Believers never have to worry about the ecacy </p>
<p>of this intercession, because it is born from God’s own presence within </p>
<p>them (8:27), working to bring about his purpose (8:28). (Jewish people </p>
<p>oen spoke of God who “searches hearts.”)</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>Still holding in tension the present suerings (8:18, 22) with the fu-</p>
<p>ture glory (8:18, 21, 30), Paul arms that God</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>causes all these present</p>
<p>diculties to produce good for those who love him (8:28). Some philoso-</p>
<p>phers spoke of cooperating with fate or even maintaining happiness with </p>
<p>it;</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>Paul goes beyond this, not resigned to impersonal fate but trusting</p>
<p>the benevolent design of God, even when it seems hidden from external </p>
<p>human experience of the present. ose who love him are special to him </p>
<p>(cf. 1 Cor 2:9; 8:3; Deut 7:9; Sir 1:10). ese are “called according to his </p>
<p>purpose” (Rom 8:28),</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>and his purpose is to conform them to the image</p>
<p>of his Son (8:29), thus bringing them to glory (8:30). e “good” that God </p>
<p>seeks for those who love him, then, is above all their ultimate glory.</p>
<p>God uses his Son Jesus as the paradigm for making believers into </p>
<p>God’s children (8:29). Although Jesus was already God’s Son before-</p>
<p>ered so sublime or sacred they were unutterable (cf. 2 Cor 12:4); Paul may transfer that </p>
<p>sacredness to how God feels and responds to the suerings of his children.</p>
<p>38. Cf. perhaps the paraklētos of John 14:16; 1 John 2:1; discussion in Keener 2003b: </p>
<p>956–61.</p>
<p>39. E.g., 1 Chron 28:9; t. Sanh. 8:3; on his full knowledge of hearts, Ps. Sol. 9:3; 14:8; </p>
<p>Let. Aris. 132–33; Josephus Ag. Ap. 2.166; idem Ant. 4.41; Philo Providence 2.35; see </p>
<p>further in Keener 2003b: 532.</p>
<p>40. “All things work” appears the likeliest reading, but no Jew would believe these </p>
<p>“all things” were random (cf. Philo Spec. Laws 4.187; Josephus Ag. Ap. 2.294; m. Ber. 9:5; </p>
Eichrodt 1983: 19–20; even many philosophers believed that a divine Mind ordered “all
<p>things”). e context is clear that God is sovereign in working through the present suer-</p>
<p>ings; cf. also Gen 50:20 (although Paul’s outcome in this context is esp. eschatological).</p>
<p>41. See e.g., Seneca Dial. 1.1.5; 1.2.4; 1.3.1; 1.5.8; 7.8.3; 7.15.4; idem Ep. Lucil. 96.1–2; </p>
<p>123.3; Musonius Rufus frg. 38, p. 136.1–8; Epictetus Disc. 1.14.16; 4.7.9; idem Ench. 8; </p>
<p>Crates Ep. 35; Marcus Aurelius Med. 6.16; Diogenes Laertius 6.2.63.</p>
<p>42. e “called” include Gentiles (9:24–26), including the saints in Rome (1:6–7); the </p>
<p>called will be gloried (8:30). God’s “purpose” depends on his grace, not works (9:11).</p>
