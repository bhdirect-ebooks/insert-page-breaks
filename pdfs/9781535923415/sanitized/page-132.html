<p>Romans 8:18–30</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>1:23). When the image would be fully restored in Christ (8:29), those in </p>
<p>the new Adam would be better stewards of the new world (4:13; 5:17).</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Perhaps the dependence of creation’s restoration on the revelation of </p>
<p>God’s children means partly that just as Israel’s restoration would signal </p>
<p>the world’s salvation (11:12), it was only Christ’s return for his people that </p>
<p>would transform the cosmos (cf. Isa 65:17–18; 66:22).</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>e glorication</p>
<p>and liberation of God’s children (8:21) would also liberate creation from </p>
<p>“corruption” (8:21), i.e., mortality (cf. 1 Cor 15:42, 50; Gal 6:8). Adam </p>
<p>introduced death into the world; Christ’s redemption brought life (Rom </p>
<p>5:17–18), and the eects are to be cosmic.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>“Slavery” (also 8:15) reects</p>
<p>the old order in Adam, including slavery to sin (6:6, 12–21) and perhaps </p>
<p>the law (7:6, 25).</p>
<p>Longing for this liberation from perishability, creation’s present suf-</p>
<p>ferings (8:18) are in a sense birth pangs of the future world (8:22). As </p>
<p>Israel “groaned” because of slavery, a groaning God counted as a prayer </p>
<p>for redemption (Exod 2:23), so in the present age creation (8:22), believers </p>
<p>(8:23), and the Spirit (8:26) groan in the face of suerings for the redemp-</p>
<p>tion of the body (8:23).</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>“Redemption” refers to the freeing of slaves; the</p>
<p>goal of freedom here was liberation from death (7:24), accomplished at </p>
<p>the resurrection (8:11).</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>But this image of groaning also links with the</p>
<p>image of travail (8:22) here; travail was a common image for suering in </p>
<p>Scripture, also applied to the suerings of the end time.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>Many Jewish</p>
<p>26. In a context addressing creation, even “glory” (8:21) may allude to transforma-</p>
<p>tion into Christ’s “image,” since Paul employs it as something of a synonym for image in </p>
<p>1 Cor 11:7 (cf. 2 Cor 3:18; 4:4; 4Q504 f8R:4).</p>
<p>27. See also 2 Pet 3:13; Rev 21:1; 1 En. 72:1; 91:16; Jub. 1:29; 4:26; 2 Bar. 44:9. In Paul’s </p>
<p>theology, believers have proleptically entered the new creation (2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15).</p>
<p>28. Many ancients thought that the heavens were imperishable, an image naturally </p>
<p>transferable to the future age. Livable conditions would not exist in our universe without </p>
<p>entropy and decay, and advanced life depends on the death of other life, all of which pre-</p>
<p>ceded humanity. Aside from such information being unavailable in Paul’s day, however, </p>
<p>he was speaking theologically of the sort of restoration depicted in gurative language in </p>
<p>Isa 11:6–7; 65:17–18, 25; 66:22.</p>
<p>29. “Groaning” is not limited to exodus or childbirth contexts (see e.g., Sib. Or. 3.417, </p>
<p>438, 558, 602, 752), but the present context suggests these allusions.</p>
<p>30. For end-time redemption, see e.g., 1QM 1.12; 15.1–2; 18.11.</p>
<p>31. Cf. 1QH 3.3–18; 1 En. 62:4; later, b. Sanh. 98b; Shab. 118a; possibly 1 ess 5:3. </p>
<p>For judgment imagery more generally, see e.g., Ps 48:6; Isa 13:8; 21:3; 26:17; 42:14; Jer </p>
<p>4:31; 6:24; 13:21; 22:23; 30:6; 31:8; 48:41; 49:22, 24; 50:43; Hos 13:13. Against the sup-</p>
<p>position that its common gurative use deprived the image of its original strength for </p>
