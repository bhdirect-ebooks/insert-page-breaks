<p>1 Cor 8:6). Philosophers tried to distinguish the use of these terms for </p>
<p>various sorts of causes.</p>

<p>Paul is saying something like that God authored</p>
<p>all things, is the necessary agency through which they occur, and in the </p>
<p>end all these things will fulll his purposes. Rather than yielding to the </p>
<p>temptation to doubt why only a minority of his people have responded to </p>
<p>the gospel, Paul expresses full condence that history will unfold accord-</p>
<p>ing to God’s perfect purposes. us, God has everything under control, as </p>
<p>his servants will recognize fully when it is complete.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Boasting against Other Branches</p>
<p>By “remnant” Paul meant less than Israel as a whole; he would have been </p>
<p>shocked and distressed to discover that in much of subsequent history the </p>
<p>remnant represented an even smaller proportion of his people than in his own </p>
<p>day. For Paul, the massive Gentile church was intended at least in part to </p>
<p>provoke Israel’s repentance (11:11–12). Paul’s own ministry to Gentiles was </p>
<p>to push forward this phase of God’s plan that would precede the turning of his </p>
<p>own people (11:13–14; cf. Matt 24:14; Luke 21:24; 2 Pet 3:9), yet it was the </p>
<p>reverse that occurred. This massive Gentile church soon forgot Paul’s warn-</p>
<p>ings against being arrogant against the people of their own spiritual heritage </p>
<p>(11:18). Inverting an earlier Jewish church’s sense of spiritual superiority over </p>
<p>Gentiles, they adopted a displacement theology (the Gentile church replac-</p>
<p>ing Israel), and instead of provoking jealousy in Israel, provoked contempt. </p>
<p>Centuries of anti–Semitism in the name of Christianity, all the while claim-</p>
<p>ing to obey Israel’s God and king, polarized two “religions” and reduced the </p>
<p>“remnant.” Paul, who saw himself as converting Gentiles to the true faith of </p>
<p>Israel (proselytes without ethnic constraints), would have been horriﬁed at </p>
<p>the Gentile church despising its own roots and religious siblings. He would </p>
<p>undoubtedly have been pleased, however, that in more recent times barriers </p>
<p>have begun to break down, with interfaith dialogue and the growth of the </p>
<p>Messianic Jewish movement.</p>
<p>Paul moves from the broad historical perspectives of chapter 11 to </p>
<p>interpersonal relationships in chapter 12. Because he was concerned with </p>
<p>applying this knowledge, we may also consider how some of his fundamental </p>
<p>principles apply in other sorts of settings. In addition to his concern for God’s </p>
