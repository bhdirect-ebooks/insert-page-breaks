<p>Romans 2:1–16</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>appeals to the Greco-Roman notion of “conscience” (9:1).</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Although</p>
<p>employing it in a wide range of ways, Greco-Roman sources (including </p>
<p>Jewish ones) speak widely of a law of nature,</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>and even Palestinian Jews</p>
<p>outside this widespread tradition seem to have believed that God had </p>
<p>given laws to Gentiles’ ancestors in the time of Noah.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Such a morally</p>
informed person’s divided thoughts in 2:15 may presage the morally di-
<p>vided person in 7:15–23 (who, however, knows more specically Moses’s </p>
<p>law and hyperbolically appears incapable of doing any good).</p>
<p>Indicting Hypocrisy (2:17–24)</p>
<p>Paul’s diatribe uses rhetorical exaggeration, common in polemic, to hold </p>
<p>attention. e evildoing Jewish interlocutor here is hyperbolic, perhaps </p>
<p>even reduced to the absurd.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> Certainly most Jewish people did not com-</p>
<p>mit adultery or rob temples! Paul’s graphically rendered point is simply </p>
<p>that Jewish ethnicity or possession of the law cannot guarantee moral su-</p>
<p>periority to Gentiles. (Paul will maintain the sin of all Jews with a biblical </p>
<p>argument in 3:9–20.) Because of the general law of nature, some Gentiles </p>
<p>might do what is morally right (2:14–15), even while this hyperbolic </p>
<p>Jewish objector, who three or four times reiterates dependence on the law </p>
<p>(2:17, 18, 20, 23), dishonors God by breaking it (2:23).</p>
<p>Torah study was central to Pharisaic and presumably other Jewish </p>
<p>teachers’ piety (2:17–20), but intellectual and spiritual prociency risked </p>
<p>generating pride in one’s accomplishments, then as now. Certainly today </p>
<p>some have used such prociency to diminish their concern with corre-</p>
<p>sponding failure in the area of praxis. is Jewish teacher’s fundamental </p>
<p>problem, twice repeated, is nding security in or “boasting” in the law </p>
<p>(2:17, 23; cf. Sir 39:8). Ancients oen considered unqualied boasting ob-</p>
<p>13. Already used in Greek-speaking Judaism (e.g., Josephus Ant. 16.103, 212; idem </p>
<p>J . W. 4.189, 193; T. Reu. 4:3; Wallis 1974–75; idem 1975).</p>
<p>14. In moral senses, e.g., Xenophon Mem. 4.4.19; Aristotle Rhet. 1.15.6, 1375ab; </p>
<p>Cicero Inv. 2.22.65; 2.53.161; Seneca Ben. 4.17.4; Musonius Rufus 16, p. 104.35–36; </p>
<p>Epictetus Disc. 2.16.27–28; Horsley 1978. Philo viewed Moses’s law as a written version </p>
<p>of the law of nature (Najman 2003).</p>
<p>15. E.g., Jub. 7:20; t. ‘Abod. Zar. 8:4–8; b. Sanh. 56a, bar.; Pesiq. Rab Kah. 12:1; Gen. </p>
<p>Rab. 34:8.</p>
<p>16. Reductio ad absurdum was a familiar line of argument (cf. e.g., Lysias Or. 4.5–6, </p>
<p>§101; Seneca Ep. Lucil. 83.9; 113.20; Heath 1997: 93–94).</p>
