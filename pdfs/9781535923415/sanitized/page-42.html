<p>their situation, and the fact that half of the explicit biblical citations found </p>
<p>in all his writings appear in this one letter suggests that this presentation </p>
<p>of the gospel is directed toward a situation concerned with the status of </p>
Gentile believers vis-à-vis the law (likely a major point of division in a
<p>conict between Jewish and Gentile factions).</p>
<p>Romans and Pauline eology</p>
<p>Whereas Paul’s rhetoric in addressing the law is combative and hyperbolic </p>
<p>in Galatians, it seems more nuanced in Romans, where he writes to per-</p>
<p>suade rather than to rebuke. (Both kinds of letter and rhetoric are known </p>
<p>in antiquity, and Paul shows skill in writing in both styles where neces-</p>
<p>sary.) He addresses a setting less polemical than in Galatians (although he </p>
<p>is still ready to address opponents on the issue polemically in Philippians </p>
<p>[3:2, 18–19], which in my view was written aer Romans). Paul may have </p>
<p>critics in Rome (perhaps those mentioned in 3:8), but it seems less likely </p>
<p>that he has actual opponents (unlike he did in Galatia), despite those he </p>
<p>denounces in 16:17–18. Here he deploys some arguments familiar to us </p>
<p>from the earlier letter, while he avoids leaving misimpressions on the </p>
<p>many believers in Rome who (in contrast to those in Galatia) lack fuller </p>
<p>acquaintance with his teaching. Still, even in Romans Paul can presup-</p>
<p>pose familiarity with common early Christian teaching, explanations if </p>
<p>necessary by colleagues who know him (such as Priscilla and Aquila), and </p>
<p>more detailed explanations from the letter bearer, Phoebe.</p>
<p>While the situation calls for a particular articulation of Paul’s mes-</p>
<p>sage that is characteristic of Romans, as opposed to, say, First or Second </p>
<p>Corinthians, its theme does reect a broadly characteristic Pauline em-</p>
<p>phasis. e letter’s central theme is the gospel that is the same for Jew and </p>
<p>Gentile alike, a gospel emphasizing dependence on God’s initiative rather </p>
<p>than weak human power (1:16–17). In Romans, Paul argues that Jews </p>
<p>cannot boast that their law keeping or election makes them superior to </p>
<p>Gentile believers; God produces true righteousness not by ethnic identity </p>
<p>or human observance of regulations, but by the transformed life of a new </p>
<p>humanity empowered directly by him.</p>
Scholars have sometimes been divided between those who think that
<p>Paul addresses a universal human problem and those who think he ad-</p>
<p>dresses a specic local one, but this dichotomy is unnecessary. Although </p>
<p>Paul focuses much attention specically on the law because of the Jewish-</p>
