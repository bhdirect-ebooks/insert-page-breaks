<p>Closing of Romans</p>
<p>175</p>
<p>summons to the believers to oer themselves as living sacrices “pleas-</p>
<p>ing” to God (12:1) by engaging in humble cooperation (12:3). Drawing </p>
<p>on an image from the law, Paul is careful to attribute the consecration </p>
<p>(using the verb hagiazō) to the same source as all new life (8:2–13), the </p>
<p>Holy (hagios) Spirit (cf. the connection between the “Holy” Spirit and </p>
<p>holiness, or separation to God, also in 1 ess 4:7–8.) Believers become </p>
<p>consecrated to God at conversion in Christ (1 Cor 1:2; 6:11), hence are </p>
<p>called “saints” (hagioi, holy or consecrated ones; Rom 1:7; 8:27; 16:2, 15), </p>
<p>but as in 6:11 Paul wants to help them “be” what they “are” (cf. 2 Cor 7:1; </p>
<p>1 ess 3:13).</p>
<p>While Paul has disavowed all boasting in works (2:23; 3:27; 4:2),</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>he</p>
<p>is ready to boast in what Christ has worked</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> through him (Rom 15:17–</p>
<p>19; cf. 1 Cor 1:31; 2 Cor 10:17). Paul is explaining the importance of the </p>
<p>“grace given to him” to share with them (15:15), hence why they should </p>
<p>heed him. e goal of his ministry (presenting Gentiles as an oering to </p>
<p>God, 15:16) is Gentiles’ obedience in word and deed</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>(15:18), precisely</p>
<p>what Paul wishes to accomplish among them (1:5; 16:26). Christ has been </p>
<p>achieving this obedience through Paul by means of the power of the Spirit </p>
<p>(15:19), the same “power” active in believers’ lives and ultimately in their </p>
<p>resurrection (cf. Rom 1:4; 15:13; 1 Cor 2:4; 1 ess 1:5).</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>is power of</p>
<p>the Spirit (cf. Acts 10:38) was also expressed in “signs and wonders” (as </p>
<p>in 2 Cor 12:12; cf. Acts 2:22, 43; 14:3; 15:12). If Paul’s hearers had not </p>
<p>caught earlier prophetic allusions in his comparisons with Moses (Rom </p>
<p>9:3) or Elijah (Rom 11:2), the mention of “signs and wonders” should </p>
<p>have evoked the exodus and ministry of Moses (Exod 7:3; 11:9–10; Deut </p>
<p>4:34; 6:22; 7:19; 11:3; 26:8; 34:11; Jer 32:20–21; Wis 10:15–16; Bar 2:11). </p>
<p>Paul not only theologized about a new exodus (Rom 8:14–17), he was an </p>
<p>agent demonstrating its current reality (cf. the comparison with Moses </p>
<p>18. ough Paul spoke “daringly” (tolmēros, 15:15) about Christ, he would not “dare” </p>
<p>(tolmaō) to boast of himself (15:18). On the impropriety of boasting, see e.g., Plutarch </p>
<p>De laude; Forbes 1986.</p>
<p>19. In 7:8, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, sin “worked” (katergazomai) in the person under law, </p>
<p>beyond the person’s volition; here Paul credits Christ for the good work in him (cf. Christ </p>
<p>working through him in Col 1:29, albeit with a dierent verb).</p>
<p>20. “Word and deed” appears throughout ancient sources as a way of summarizing all </p>
<p>behavior or demonstrating behavioral consistency with verbal claims.</p>
<p>21. On the connection of “power” and the Spirit in Paul, see also Gräbe 1992; else-</p>
<p>where, e.g., Ps. Sol. 17:37 (for the Messiah); L.A.B. 27:10; but especially Mic 3:8; Zech </p>
<p>4:6.</p>
