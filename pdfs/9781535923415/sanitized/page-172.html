<p>Romans 12:1–8</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>Paul’s central point, however, is that each believer has something to con-</p>
<p>tribute to the proper functioning of Christ’s body. From this observation </p>
<p>it seems not too much to infer that the body would oen fail to function </p>
properly when individual members fail to recognize their value and con-
<p>tribute their gi, or when other members try to usurp roles not suited for </p>
<p>their particular grace or faith. A large number of scholars argue strenu-</p>
<p>ously that “proportion [analogia] of faith” in 12:6 represents a standard </p>
<p>for faith, useful for evaluating prophecy. (Paul did use gospel teaching as </p>
<p>a standard for evaluating teachers, 6:17; 16:17.) Nevertheless, the Greek </p>
<p>word is commonly equivalent to Paul’s “measure” of faith in 12:3; Paul is </p>
<p>again emphasizing that God apportions faith for dierent gis to dierent </p>
<p>believers.</p>
<p>Again as elsewhere (1 Cor 12:8–10, 28, 29–30; 14:26), Paul provides </p>
<p>a mostly ad hoc list of gis (Rom 12:6–8), though he values prophecy </p>
<p>particularly highly (Rom 12:6; 1 Cor 12:28; 14:1).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Dividing the gis into</p>
<p>“natural” (like giving) and “supernatural” (like prophecy) misses Paul’s </p>
<p>point, since all reect God’s activity. “Service” is a broad term potentially </p>
<p>including ministries like Paul’s (Rom 11:13; 15:25, 31; 2 Cor 4:1; 5:18) </p>
<p>or even any grace-gi (1 Cor 12:5; cf. Eph 4:12; Col 4:17). Whereas Paul </p>
<p>counts “teaching” as a gi just like prophecy, prophecy probably depends </p>
<p>more directly on inspiration for its message (in its ultimate form, oen </p>
<p>rst-person declaration from God, as in Rev 2–3). Divine empowerment </p>
in teaching probably works more through divinely guided cognitive pro-
<p>cesses (on which cf. Rom 8:5–7; 12:2–3). Earlier Scripture (Rom 15:4; cf. </p>
<p>1 Tim 4:13) and the message about Jesus (Eph 4:21; Col 1:28; 2:7; 2 ess </p>
<p>2:15) are probably important bases for teaching, although like other gis </p>
<p>the ministry of teaching was subject to abuse or pride (cf. Rom 2:20–21).</p>
<p>Whatever else “exhortation” (note parakaleō and paraklēsis, 12:8) </p>
<p>might include, it surely includes exhortations like Paul’s own in this letter </p>
<p>(12:1; 15:30; 16:17). One of its sources could be Scripture (15:4), although </p>
<p>prophecy could also serve this function (1 Cor 14:3). Although “giving” </p>
<p>(metadidōmi) can have a broader sense (cf. the same verb for Paul’s spiri-</p>
<p>tual giving to them, 1:11), it may at least include money (cf. Eph 4:28). e </p>
<p>term oen translated “generosity” (haplotēs) can mean simply “sincerity,” </p>
<p>but could apply to monetary benefaction (2 Cor 8:2; 9:11, 13). ose gied </p>
<p>16. On these gis, see further e.g., Turner 1998; Keener 2003a.</p>
