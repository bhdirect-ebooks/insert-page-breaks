<p>Life in Christ and the Spirit</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>e deliberately lopsided contrast is developed more fully in 5:18–</p>
<p>19. Adam’s transgression introduced death to all humanity (all born as </p>
<p>Adam’s descendants, dependent on him as esh). By contrast, Jesus’s act of </p>
<p>obedience and righteousness introduced righting, life, and righteousness </p>
<p>to all who are in him (baptized into solidarity with him, 6:3; dependent </p>
<p>on him through the Spirit, 8:1–11).</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> (“e many”</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>in this context refers</p>
<p>to all who are dened by their relationship to either Adam or Christ.)</p>
<p>Jesus’s act of obedience that reverses Adam’s disobedience (5:18–19) </p>
<p>alludes back to his death for us in the Father’s loving design (5:6–10). </p>
<p>Paul elsewhere denes Jesus’s obedience in terms of humbling himself to </p>
<p>the point of shameful execution on a cross, perhaps in contrast to Adam </p>
seeking divinity (Phil 2:6–8; cf. Gen 3:5). Adam, by seeking greater life,
<p>brought death, whereas Jesus by dying brought life. Just as Adam intro-</p>
<p>duced sin, Jesus now introduces true righteousness (5:19) that stems from </p>
<p>solidarity with his obedience. Paul’s understanding is not that Jesus mere-</p>
<p>ly reverses Adam’s punishment (although his accomplishment includes </p>
<p>that),</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>but that Jesus came to form a new basis for humanity, enabling</p>
<p>people to serve God fully from the heart (cf. 8:2–4, 29).</p>
<p>In 5:20 Paul returns to the role of the law that he introduced in 5:13: </p>
<p>as God’s righteous standard, it more visibly exposes sin to condemna-</p>
<p>tion.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>Because law did not transform Adamites from the heart, it merely</p>
<p>intensied their problem. Because Jewish people believed that the law </p>
<p>as moral instruction enabled them to be more righteous than Gentiles </p>
<p>(cf. 6:15; 7:12, 14a, 16, 22), statements like this (and 6:14; 7:5, 8–9) were </p>
<p>meant to shock them into paying attention. e law was perfect (7:12), </p>
<p>but meant to inform rather than transform, unless written in the heart by </p>
<p>29. Some read these verses universalistically, in tension with statements about the </p>
<p>eschatological destruction of some (2:5; 9:22; Phil 3:19; 1 ess 5:3), but the context </p>
<p>delimits the application of Adam’s and Christ’s work to those who are in each of them, re-</p>
<p>maining consistent with texts about destruction. e future tense of “being righteoused” </p>
<p>here suggests completion eschatologically.</p>
<p>30. e phrase refers to the elect at Qumran (1QS 6.6–21; cf. Dan 12:3; Marcus 1956), </p>
<p>but is here used also for the “many” in Adam (5:19a), parallel with “all humanity” (5:18); </p>
<p>the phrase can refer to “the multitudes” (e.g., Epictetus Disc. 1.2.18; 1.3.4; 2.1.22). It is not </p>
<p>impossible that Paul alludes to the justication of the “many” in Isa 53:11–12 (though </p>
<p>“many” is frequent in the lxx).</p>
<p>31. Despite Paul’s possible use of some cognates in this section for purposes of varia-</p>
<p>tion, dikaiōsis in 5:18 is clearly forensic, contrasted with the “condemnation” brought by </p>
<p>Adam’s sin.</p>
<p>32. Cf. 2 Bar. 15:5–6; see excursus on the law, preceding 7:7–13.</p>
