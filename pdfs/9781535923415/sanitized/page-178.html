<p>Romans 13</p>
<p>Living the Christian Life (12:1—15:13), cont.</p>
<p>Respecting the State (13:1–7)</p>
<p>is passage continues the preceding ethical exhortation about how to </p>
<p>behave toward outsiders, and as such makes sense in its context. Yet Paul </p>
<p>elaborates it at much greater length than even the exhortations for nonre-</p>
<p>taliation in 12:14, 17, 19–21. Why? Perhaps we should think of a chiastic </p>
<p>approach:</p>
<p>A Exhortations regarding fellow believers (12:9–13)</p>
<p> B Exhortations regarding outsiders (12:14–21)</p>
<p> B´ A detailed issue regarding outsiders (13:1–7)</p>
<p>A´ A detailed question regarding fellow believers (14:1—15:7)</p>
<p>Such an approach is possible (though weakened by its asymmetry and fail-</p>
<p>ure to account for 13:8–14), but even if it is correct, it begs the question. </p>
<p>Why does Paul elaborate on this particular issue regarding outsiders?</p>
<p>Ancient writers oen addressed the topic of societal relationships, </p>
<p>in terms of relationships to the state, parents and elders, wives, children, </p>
<p>and household slaves.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Where parts of this conventional topic appear in</p>
<p>early Christian sources, they oen relate to concern how outsiders will </p>
<p>view believers (1 Tim 5:14–15; 6:1; Titus 2:5, 8, 10).</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>at is, the authors</p>
<p>write at least partly from apologetic concern for the reputation of this </p>
<p>1. See concisely Isocrates Demon. 16, Or. 1; Cicero Inv. 2.22.65; Diogenes Laertius </p>
<p>8.1.22–23; further, Lührmann 1980; Malherbe 1986: 89–90, 135, 145–47. For Stoic loy-</p>
<p>alty to the state, see e.g., Erskine 1990: 181–204; for Judaism, e.g., m. ’Abot 3:2; Tobin </p>
<p>2004: 397–98; Stuhlmacher 1994: 199–200. e frequency of the topic challenges the in-</p>
<p>terpretation that this passage is directed toward submission to synagogue authorities (the </p>
<p>argument of Nanos 1996: 289–336, despite many other strong features in his work).</p>
<p>2. See e.g., discussion in Padgett 1987.</p>
