<p>Romans 2</p>
<p>Made Right by Trusting Christ (1:18—5:11), cont.</p>
<p>God’s Impartial Judgment (2:1–16)</p>
<p>In this section (and some others, most obviously 3:1–9; 9:14–24) Paul </p>
<p>employs a lively rhetorical style called diatribe, commonly used for teach-</p>
<p>ing. is style typically includes an imaginary interlocutor, who may or </p>
<p>may not be explicitly identied, who raises objections. ese objections </p>
<p>allow the speaker or writer to develop the argument, demolishing the </p>
<p>objections one at a time while holding the audience’s attention.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Scholars</p>
<p>debate whether Paul begins addressing a specically Jewish interlocutor </p>
<p>here (2:3) or only at 2:17 (where it is explicit); most likely he implicitly </p>
<p>addresses the Jewish interlocutor throughout the chapter, since what “we </p>
<p>know” (2:2), what the interlocutor should know (2:4), and the continuity </p>
<p>of subject matter (cf. 2:9–10, 12–15; with 2:25–29) all suggest a Jewish </p>
<p>hearer. Nevertheless, Paul remains subtle in the rst section, springing his </p>
<p>rhetorical trap only gradually as he shows that Jew and Gentile alike are </p>
<p>condemned. Singling out a hearer (rhetorical “apostrophe”), as Paul does </p>
<p>with “O man” (2:1, 3; cf. 9:20), was a common rhetorical device,</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>again</p>
<p>eective for holding audience attention.</p>
<p>Because those who commit all kinds of sins (1:29–31) recognize that </p>
<p>such behavior merits death under God’s standard (1:32), they deserve di-</p>
<p>vine judgment (2:3, 5). Whether they (like morally lax Gentiles) excuse </p>
<p>or (like strict Jews) condemn such behavior, they are condemned (2:15). </p>
<p>In 1:32 they excuse it, and in 2:1 they condemn it, but both approaches of </p>
<p>sinners are inexcusable (1:20; 2:1–5).</p>

<p>2. E.g., Isa 22:17; Mic 6:8; Epictetus Disc. 1.1.23 and passim; Marcus Aurelius Med. </p>
<p>5.36.1; 11.15. For the interlocutor including Jews, see e.g., Augustine Exp. prop. Rom. </p>
<p>7–8 (Bray 1998: 52).</p>
