<p>Made Right by Trusting Christ</p>

<p>15:4; 1 Cor 10:11).</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>We have already noted how Paul shapes his telling</p>
<p>of Abraham’s story to prepare for resurrection faith in 4:24. In 4:25 Paul </p>
<p>summarizes his gospel (grounded in Scripture, cf. 1 Cor 15:3–4). Paul </p>
<p>may use parallel clauses here (dia + the accusative = “on account of”) </p>
<p>simply for rhetorical eect, even though the rst clause notes the cause </p>
<p>requiring Jesus’s death and the second the goal (hence an ultimate, te-</p>
<p>leological cause) of his resurrection.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>In view of his abundant allusions</p>
<p>to Isaiah in Romans, his language in 4:24–25 may allude to the suering </p>
<p>servant of Isa 53:5–12.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Paul’s new term paraptōma (“transgression”) prepares for the six </p>
<p>uses of the term in 5:15–20, as Paul’s use of the rare term dikaiōsis (“ac-</p>
<p>quittal”) prepares for his only other use of it in 5:18 (where it contrasts </p>
<p>with paraptōma). Paul’s teaching in the following units seems to esh out </p>
<p>more explicitly what Jesus’s death on account of sin means, both in terms </p>
<p>of Jesus’s martyrdom turning away God’s wrath (5:9) and his perfect obe-</p>
<p>dience in death reversing Adam’s disobedience (5:18–19).</p>
<p>21. Paul’s approach here is to argue from analogy, not to “allegorize” like Philo, </p>
<p>though he employs the same “on our account” in 1 Cor 9:10 (regarding a law; see e.g., </p>
<p>discussion in Keener 2005b: 78–79).</p>
<p>22. ose who trust in Jesus’s resurrection are righted in 4:24. God rights believers </p>
<p>both because of Jesus’s death (4:25) and his resurrection (5:9). Although his focus is </p>
<p>more oen on the resurrection, Paul emphasizes dierent aspects at dierent points for </p>
<p>rhetorical balance.</p>
<p>23. Oen noted: e.g., Hunter 1955: 54; Stuhlmacher 1994: 75; Dunn 1988: 1:241; </p>
