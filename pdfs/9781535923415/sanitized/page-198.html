<p>Romans 15:1–13</p>
<p>172</p>
<p>to the Father’s “glory” (15:7) ts the exhortation to “glorify” God together </p>
<p>(15:6), a model relevant for Gentile believers (15:9).</p>
<p>Lest we suppose that Paul envisions the need for unity in the Roman </p>
<p>church in a purely abstract or theoretical way, Paul appeals to Christ’s </p>
<p>example as one who served both Israel (15:8) and the Gentiles (15:9). In </p>
<p>15:8 he returns to his emphasis on God’s faithfulness to his promises to </p>
<p>the ancestors (9:4; 11:26–27; cf. God being “true” in 3:4), though Gentile </p>
<p>believers have also been graed into these (4:13–16; cf. Gal 3:14–29). </p>
<p>(Although Paul will oer other biblical support rst, citing Christ as a </p>
<p>“servant” for Gentiles as well as for Israel may also pregure his citation </p>
<p>about the suering servant in 15:21, and recall 10:15–16.) In 15:9 he be-</p>
<p>gins his nal major collection of citations, a rhetorical climax and his </p>
<p>most compelling exegetical case for Gentile inclusion, reserved for the </p>
<p>nale of his letter’s body.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Jewish interpreters oen linked biblical texts</p>
<p>based on a common key term or concept, and Paul here links four texts </p>
<p>about Gentiles, implying their faith. Many texts revealed God’s interest </p>
<p>in Gentiles praising him, sometimes along with his people (15:9–10) </p>
<p>and under the same king of Israel in whom even Gentiles would hope </p>
<p>(15:12).</p>
<p>Paul thus summons believers to common, cross-cultural worship of </p>
<p>the one God (15:6–12; cf. 3:30). In glorifying God, Gentile believers (15:9) </p>
<p>along with Jewish ones (15:6) would follow the faithful steps of their an-</p>
<p>cestor Abraham (4:20). Gentiles glorify God for his mercy (15:9) as Paul </p>
<p>did in 11:33–36—Paul has already shown how Gentiles receive “mercy” </p>
<p>(9:15–24) as part of God’s plan that includes Israel as well (11:30–32). </p>
<p>In 15:9 Paul cites Ps 18:49, which illustrates that God would be gloried </p>
<p>among the nations.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>In 15:10 he cites Deut 32:43, a context familiar from</p>
<p>10:19 and 12:19; that Gentiles rejoice “with his people” (in the Greek ver-</p>
<p>7. Verse 4 shows the emphasis Paul places on biblical support. For clinching nales, </p>
<p>see e.g., Isaeus Hagnias 50; Cicero Quinct. 25.78–80. For the sake of the most biblically </p>
<p>literate, he apparently samples the major parts of the canon (writings, law, and prophets; </p>
<p>Jewett 2007: 893) to show how pervasive the interest is in Scripture. lxx Isaiah in par-</p>
<p>ticular exhibited an ethnically universalist agenda (Roetzel 2003: 52).</p>
<p>8. He might also cite it as a Davidic psalm. It might also be understood as the </p>
<p>Messiah’s prayer (as in Rom 15:3), given the lxx mention of “Christ” in the next verse </p>
<p>(cf. also Johnson 2001: 219). See for this Hays 2005: 102 (who notes on 107 that Paul’s </p>
<p>repertoire of psalms applied to Christ’s prayers share the superscription eis to telos, “for </p>
<p>the end,” which early Christians may have viewed as eschatologically signicant).</p>
