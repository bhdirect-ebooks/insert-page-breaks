<p>Introduction</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>as the ultimate display of God’s power (Rom 1:4; 1 Cor 6:14; 15:43; Eph </p>
<p>1:19–20; Phil 3:10, 21). Jesus’s followers, however, recognize this resur-</p>
<p>rection as not merely a theoretical hope for the future, but a future reality </p>
<p>already initiated in history: Paul speaks literally here of Jesus’s resurrec-</p>
<p>tion “from among the dead ones,” implying that Jesus’s resurrection is the </p>
<p>rst installment of the future promise of resurrection for the righteous </p>
<p>(cf. Acts 4:2). Paul elsewhere associates God’s Holy Spirit</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>with power</p>
<p>(Rom 15:13, 19; 1 Cor 2:4; Eph 3:16; 1 ess 1:5; cf. also Mic 3:8; Zech </p>
<p>4:6; Luke 1:35; 4:14; Acts 1:8; 10:38), and arms that the same Spirit who </p>
<p>raised Jesus will also raise all believers (Rom 8:11).</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Paul stresses Jesus’s</p>
<p>resurrection as a prominent element of the good news (4:24–25; 6:4–5, 9; </p>
<p>7:4; 8:11, 34; 10:9).</p>
<p>rough Jesus Paul has received “grace” for his apostolic mission </p>
<p>(1:5). Each believer received God’s generous, unmerited giing or “grace,” </p>
<p>empowering them for their own special role or purpose in serving his </p>
<p>people (Rom 12:6; cf. 1 Cor 1:7; 12:4, 9, 28–31; Eph 4:7); Paul’s grace is </p>
<p>expressed in this letter by serving them (12:3; 15:15). Paul’s mission is to </p>
<p>bring Gentiles to the obedience of faith, hence his desire to share his mes-</p>
<p>sage with Christ’s followers in Rome, who are among the Gentiles (1:5; </p>
<p>cf. 1:13–15).</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>What does Paul mean by “obedience of faith”? e Greek</p>
<p>phrase could be understood in several ways, but Paul is concerned that </p>
<p>believers obey God rather than sin (6:12, 16–17; cf. 5:19), and elsewhere </p>
<p>speaks of their obedience (16:19) and his mission to bring Gentiles to </p>
<p>obedience (15:18). Paul also emphasizes “faith” oen in Romans (some </p>
<p>forty times, plus twenty-one uses of the cognate verb). He is clear from </p>
<p>the beginning that genuine faith in Christ (itself obedience to the gospel; </p>
<p>cf. 6:17) should, if carried out, produce a righteous lifestyle (see ch. 6).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> </p>
<p>13. “Spirit of holiness” may associate the Spirit with being set apart for God (1 ess </p>
<p>4:7–8; cf. Dunn 1970: 105–6; Smith 2006: 98; Keener 1997: 8–10) but is also simply a </p>
<p>good Semitic way of speaking of the “Holy Spirit” (for both concepts together, cf. e.g., </p>
<p>1QS 3.7; 4.21).</p>
<p>14. For the Spirit and resurrection, see also m. Sotah 9:15.</p>
<p>15. Some take “among the Gentiles” as indicating that they were predominantly </p>
<p>Gentile. Literally, it might simply locate them in the Diaspora; one may infer their largely </p>
<p>Gentile status, however, in 1:13–15.</p>
<p>16. Cf. also discussion in Schlatter 1995: 11; Jewett 2007: 110. For the nations’ prom-</p>
<p>ised obedience, cf. Gen 49:10; Isa 45:14; 49:23; 60:14. Paul’s vision of Gentiles’ incorpora-</p>
<p>tion as Abraham’s children (see ch. 4) contrasts with the empire’s subjugation of nations </p>
<p>(see Lopez 2008).</p>
