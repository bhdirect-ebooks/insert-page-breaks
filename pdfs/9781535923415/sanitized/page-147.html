<p>Israel’s Role and Salvation</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>of how God saved Israel in the rst exodus (see comment on 8:14–17), </p>
<p>so is the pattern in this passage. In 9:22–23 the wrath against the Gentile </p>
<p>Pharaoh pregures the eschatological wrath (cf. 2:5; 5:9), but the mercy </p>
<p>(evoking 9:16–18 and especially the text in 9:15) involves salvation, for </p>
<p>both Gentiles and ultimately Israel (11:30–32; 15:9).</p>
<p>Paul must show from Scripture that God did not use an ethnic cri-</p>
<p>terion that guaranteed salvation for Jews and damnation for Gentiles. </p>
<p>As Paul backs up his claim in 9:24 with Scripture in 9:25–26, he again </p>
<p>shocks those familiar with traditional readings of the text by inverting </p>
<p>those readings. He quotes Hos 2:23 and then 1:10, both of which con-</p>
<p>textually reverse the judgment of Hos 1:9.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>In context, God had rejected</p>
<p>his people and annulled the covenant (Hos 1:9, presumably involving the </p>
<p>coming exile), but would restore them one day (1:10–11; 2:1, 23), a res-</p>
<p>toration the ultimate fulllment of which appeared future in Paul’s day. </p>
<p>Perhaps Paul uses this text to justify the Jewish remnant in 9:24, but he </p>
<p>would probably also seek to justify the more controversial incorporation </p>
<p>of Gentiles on which that verse climaxes. How could Paul (who knows </p>
<p>the context well enough to cite two key restoration texts from it) apply to </p>
<p>Gentiles a text about Israel’s restoration?</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Perhaps he reasons that if God</p>
<p>could temporarily reject his people, he might meanwhile welcome mem-</p>
<p>bers of other peoples (cf. 10:19); such an inference would t Paul’s larger </p>
<p>understanding of God’s plan, articulated in similar terms (cf. 11:30–32). </p>
<p>Certainly Paul will go on to speak of a current remnant (9:27–28) and </p>
<p>a future restoration of the Jewish people as a whole to God (11:26–27). </p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, Paul reasons that if Israel, rejected from being </p>
<p>God’s people, could again become God’s people, God could also welcome </p>
<p>others who were not his people.</p>
<p>Aer quoting Hosea, Paul in Rom 9:27–28 quotes Isa 10:22–23. Paul </p>
<p>can link this text with the one just cited (Hos 1:10) because both mention </p>
<p>Israel being “like the sand of the sea.” (Linking texts based on a com-</p>
<p>mon key term or phrase was a common Jewish interpretive technique, </p>
<p>and Paul goes so far as to blend the two texts, importing “sons of Israel” </p>
<p>18. Paul adapts the wording, inserting kaleō (“call,” 9:24–26; cf. 8:30; 9:12) from his </p>
<p>quotation in Rom 9:7 (Hays 1989: 66).</p>
<p>19. Some early Christian interpreters thought Hosea referred to Gentiles (John </p>
<p>Chrysostom Hom. Rom. 16; Augustine Exp. prop. Rom. 65); others that it had been trans-</p>
<p>ferred to Gentiles (eodoret Interp. Rom. on 9:25; Bray 1998: 266–67). Hays 1989: 67, </p>
<p>argues that Paul simply inverts the text’s plain meaning (as he oers other inversions in </p>
<p>Rom 9).</p>
