<p>Life in Christ and the Spirit</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>e present tense verbs, then, would simply serve to accentuate rhe-</p>
<p>torical vividness, something like the use of the historical present in nar-</p>
<p>rative.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Essentially Paul already outlined this contrast before depicting it:</p>
<p>the past life “in the [sphere of] the esh,” when the law stirred the body </p>
<p>for death (7:5), diers from current freedom from the law in living by the </p>
<p>Spirit (7:6). Ideally, Paul’s depiction cannot refer to a believer, least of all </p>
<p>to one who embraces Paul’s theology of new life in Christ. at is not to </p>
<p>claim that no believer would ever share any elements of the description, </p>
<p>but any believer who did so would be thinking in a manner incompat-</p>
<p>ible with Paul’s teaching on the law. For Paul, anyone struggling to be </p>
<p>made righteous by following God’s standard, rather than relying on God’s </p>
<p>transforming gi of righteousness, might experience the sort of tension </p>
<p>between knowing right and being right described here.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> Paul’s descrip-</p>
<p>tion here, however, is hyperbolic (as in 2:17–24): complete inability to do </p>
<p>right and involuntarily compulsion to do wrong (7:15–20) sounds like </p>
<p>possession rather than mere moral frustration!</p>
<p>e sort of struggle depicted in 7:14–25 would resonate with many </p>
<p>people in antiquity. Some philosophers depicted the struggle between rea-</p>
<p>son and the body’s passions,</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>an image relevant here (especially 7:22–23).</p>
<p>Judaism spoke of an evil impulse (yetzer),</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>and later teachers argued that</p>
<p>learning Torah would strengthen one’s good impulse to defeat the evil im-</p>
<p>Isa 50:1), and “delivering” them aerward (e.g., Judg 2:16, 18; 3:9).</p>
<p>19. E.g., Mark 1:12, 21, 37, 40, 41, though not consistently; Cicero Quinct. 4.14; 5.20; </p>
<p>more consistently, Caesar Bell. civ. passim. For using present tense for vivid depiction, </p>
<p>see Rowe 1997: 143–44. Speeches-in-character sought to vary tense (from present to </p>
<p>past to future in Hermogenes Progymn. 9, On Ethopoeia, 21–22, though this diers from </p>
<p>here).</p>
<p>20. For both assurance of righteousness and consciousness of sin appearing together </p>
<p>in some early Jewish texts, see e.g., Talbert 2002: 199–200 (though before Paul’s conver-</p>
<p>sion the former seems to have predominated for him, Phil 3:4–6).</p>
<p>21. E.g., 4 Macc 1:1, 9, 29; 2:18–22; 3:2–5; 13:1–2 (cf. further Krieger 2002: 87–88); </p>

<p>33.3; cf. Sallust Bell. Cat. 51.3; the continuing struggle in Seneca Ep. Lucil. 20.6; Maximus </p>
<p>of Tyre Or. 38.6; the Aristotelian theory in Engberg-Pedersen 2000: 52; idem 2003: 612; </p>

<p>Deut. 32.3.1; 45.1.3; cf. Gen 6:5; Sir 37:3. e evil yetzer was not strictly associated with </p>
<p>the body (Urbach 1979: 1:472), though it aected the body (’Abot R. Nat. 16A; Pesiq. Rab </p>
<p>Kah. Sup. 3:2).</p>
