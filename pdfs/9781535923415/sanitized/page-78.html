<p>Romans 3:1–8</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>picks the subject up in 9:4–5. Certainly he revisits the present issues more </p>
<p>fully in chs. 9–11.)</p>
<p>e interlocutor again objects in 3:3: surely Israel’s lack of faith does </p>
<p>not negate God’s faithfulness to his covenant, does it? (Unbelief and faith-</p>
<p>fulness in this verse are both cognates of “entrusted” in 3:2.) Indeed, some </p>
<p>Jewish teachers were at great pains to show that no matter how Israel </p>
<p>behaved, God always counted them as his children.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> Paul exclaims, es-</p>
<p>sentially, “No way!” (3:4).</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>But he identies God’s covenant faithfulness</p>
<p>with his righteousness (see comment on 1:17), and insists that it is God </p>
<p>as Israel’s judge, rather than disobedient Israel, who will be shown righ-</p>
<p>teous.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>(at his righteousness and faithfulness also include a continuing</p>
<p>plan for Israel will be claried later in 11:1–32, esp. 11:25–32.)</p>
<p>“Everyone is a liar” (3:4) comes from Ps 116:11 (115:2 lxx), antici-</p>
<p>pating Paul’s texts for human sinfulness in 3:10–18 (esp. 3:13). Because it </p>
<p>comes from the “Hallel” psalms used in festivals (at least in Jerusalem), </p>
<p>its wording may have been familiar. But Paul more explicitly cites Ps 51:4, </p>
<p>where the psalmist admits his guilt and God’s righteousness. Because the </p>
<p>current version of the psalm already identied it with David’s repentance, </p>
<p>Paul probably anticipates here God’s forgiveness of David without works </p>
<p>in Rom 4:6–8.</p>
<p>Reducing the now desperate objections of his imaginary interlocu-</p>
<p>tor to the absurd, Paul poses the objection that since Israel’s sin and false-</p>
<p>hood reveal God’s righteousness and truth,</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>such misbehavior ought not</p>

<p>ese rabbis taught in the late second century, but may reect earlier ideas.</p>
<p>4. Like interlocutors, such a negation is familiar in diatribe, with this phrase in the </p>
<p>late rst-century Stoic Epictetus (Malherbe 1989: 25–26; also Demosthenes Aristog. 1.30; </p>
<p>Gen 44:7, 17; Josh 22:29; 24:16); but in other language also elsewhere (e.g., Plato Charm. </p>
<p>175A; Cicero Rosc. Amer. 1.2; Seneca Ep. Lucil. 94.32; Dio Chrysostom Or. 55.3).</p>
<p>5. Cf. Ps. Sol. 8:23, 26; perhaps Gen 18:25; Sir 18:2. at God is “true” (cf. Pss 25:10; </p>
<p>31:5) means that he is “faithful”; the same Hebrew conception stands behind both Greek </p>
<p>terms (the Hebrew term elsewhere translated “faithful” is rendered “true” in the Greek </p>
<p>version of Psalms; so Dunn 1988: 1:133; e.g., Ps 40:10–11). For theodicy arguing that </p>
<p>deity is not responsible for sin, see e.g., Jas 1:13–14; Aeschines Tim. 190. “What shall we </p>
<p>say?” (3:5; cf. 4:1; 6:1; 7:7; 8:31; 9:14, 30) was a common expression (e.g., Fronto Ad M. </p>
<p>Caes. 3.17).</p>
<p>6. ese contrasts echo the contrasts between Israel’s faithlessness and God’s faithful-</p>
<p>ness in 3:3, and their deception and God’s truth in 3:4 (see Hays 2005: 54). On reductio </p>
<p>ad absurdum, see the note on Rom 2:17–24.</p>
