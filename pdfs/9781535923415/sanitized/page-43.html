<p>Introduction</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Gentile issue in Rome, the rest of his theology makes clear that the fun-</p>
<p>damental principle from which he reasons extends far beyond the law. </p>
<p>He is clear that the problem is not with the content of the law, but with </p>
<p>sin (2:14–16) and the esh—weak humanity’s inability to reect God’s </p>
<p>righteousness (Rom 7:7–8, 13–14; 8:2–4; Gal 2:21; 3:3; 5:16–21). e new </p>
<p>life of Christ and the Spirit should evidence a deeper and more complete </p>
<p>righteousness, because God empowers it. Pauline theology involves de-</p>
<p>pendence on God not only for forensic justication, but for new life (e.g., </p>
<p>8:2–17), giing for ministry to one another (12:3–8), love (13:8–10), and </p>
<p>everything else.</p>
<p>Useful Commentaries</p>
<p>A number of useful commentaries exist for English readers, each helpful </p>
<p>in its own way. I oer here a mere sample of some of these commentaries </p>
<p>below. (I have included here a few works that are not commentaries in </p>
<p>the traditional sense, yet cover most of the text of Romans.) I have omit-</p>
<p>ted some older works (though some, like Barrett 1956, Craneld 1975, </p>
<p>and Käsemann 1980, are particularly noteworthy) in order to emphasize </p>
<p>more recent ones; I also omit useful and important reference works on </p>
<p>Romans (e.g., Donfried 1991; Donfried and Richardson 1998; Haacker </p>
<p>2003; Das 2007). Among commentaries, the present commentary falls </p>
<p>within the popular to midrange categories (more so the former, if one </p>
<p>skips the notes).</p>
<p>Popular commentaries (or works covering many passages) include </p>
<p>Grieb 2002; Hunter 1955; Robinson 1979; and Wright 2004. Midrange </p>
<p>works include Byrne 1996; Johnson 2001; Stowers 1994; Stuhlmacher </p>
<p>1994; Talbert 2002; and Tobin 2004. Heavily academic works (all impres-</p>
<p>sive) include Dunn 1988; Fitzmyer 1993; Jewett 2007; Moo 1996; and </p>
<p>Schreiner 1998. I also cite some others later in the commentary itself. </p>
<p>For a survey of early readings of Romans, see, e.g., Reasoner 2005; Gaca </p>
<p>and Welborn 2005; and at greater length and reproducing many relevant </p>
<p>texts (from which I have drawn most patristic opinions mentioned in </p>
<p>this commentary), Bray 1998; for readings through history more broadly, </p>
<p>Greenman and Larsen 2005; also ad loc. in Fitzmyer 1993.</p>
