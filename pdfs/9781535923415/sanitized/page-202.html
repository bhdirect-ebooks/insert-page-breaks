<p>Romans 15:14–33</p>
<p>176</p>
<p>in 2 Cor 3:7–18). Miraculously, Paul had preached from Jerusalem</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>far as Illyricum (Rom 15:19), just as he planned to evangelize in Spain </p>
<p>(15:24, 28). Illyricum was on the eastern coast of the Adriatic, across from </p>
<p>Italy. e province was technically north of Macedonia, but he may mean </p>
<p>Illyris Graeca in western Macedonia,</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>or simply that he went “up to” (the</p>
<p>border of) Illyricum.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>(His belief that the full measure of Gentiles will</p>
<p>precede Israel’s deliverance, articulated in 11:25–26, undoubtedly moti-</p>
<p>vated his Gentile mission, including nally Spain,</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>which was oen said</p>
<p>to be at the ends of the earth.)</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Why then has Paul not come to them in person? It is obvious that </p>
<p>he does not underestimate their strategic importance; people in antiquity </p>
<p>simply would not write letters of this length without a signicant pur-</p>
<p>pose. But while Paul is eager to bring good news to believers in Rome, </p>
<p>his primary mission is to bring the good news to unevangelized regions </p>
<p>(15:20–22),</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>hence only now that he had completed this ministry is</p>
<p>he ready to come to them (15:23). Paul was a foundation layer (1 Cor </p>
<p>3:10), and did not want to squander his ministry time simply building </p>
<p>on a foundation already laid (Rom 15:20; cf. 2 Cor 10:13–16).</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>Paul did</p>
<p>22. e ideal starting point in Acts 1:8; cf. Paul’s ministry there in Acts 9:28–29. </p>
<p>Paul was converted and did some ministry near Damascus (Acts 9:19–22; Gal 1:17; 2 </p>
<p>Cor 11:32), but counts his mission from Jerusalem. His language here indicates clearly </p>
<p>a circuitous route (e.g., Moo 1996: 895), but some think that it also suggests that he </p>
<p>had “circled” around in an arch, which could make sense on the Jewish tradition that </p>
<p>Jerusalem was the world’s center (Schreiner 1998: 769; Jewett 2007: 913; cf. Ezek 5:5; </p>
<p>38:12; Jub. 8:12, 19; Sib. Or. 5.249–50; more sources in Scott 1994: 526; Keener 2003b: </p>
<p>729–30). Paul’s systematic approach to reaching all peoples was distinctive (Bowers 1980: </p>
<p>318–19).</p>
<p>23. Hengel and Schwemer 1997: 261; cf. Bruce 1977: 316.</p>
<p>24. Either way, he presumably ministered near it during his recent visit to Macedonia </p>
<p>(2 Cor 2:13).</p>
<p>25. See Aus 1979; cf. Munck 1967: 98.</p>

<p>dawn.</p>
<p>27. Riesner 1998: 248, compares “have not heard my name” in the Greek version of </p>
Isa 66:19, a passage also mentioning a divine “sign.”
<p>28. He apparently knew of others missionizing other regions to the south and east </p>
<p>(Latourette 1970: 82; on rst-century mission see esp. Schnabel 2004). e “founda-</p>
<p>tion” image coheres well with “building” the church (cf. 14:19; 15:2; here, Derrett 1997); </p>
<p>Qumran sectarians employed some analogous images. e image was, of course, a com-</p>
<p>mon one in cities (cf. White 1996: 1:27).</p>
