<p>Romans 1:18–23</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>Acts 7:42).</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>As God’s righteousness appears in the truth of the gospel</p>
<p>(1:16–17), their unrighteousness (1:18) appears in suppressing the truth </p>
<p>of God’s character (1:19–23). Saving faith (1:16–17) is thus not a guess or </p>
<p>wishful thinking, but embracing the genuine truth in contrast to lies that </p>
<p>seem progressively more plausible to depraved humanity.</p>
<p>Whereas some philosophers believed that true knowledge would </p>
<p>lead to right living, Paul believes that knowledge merely increases moral </p>
<p>responsibility (“without excuse,” 1:20; cf. 2:1, 15). God revealed enough for </p>
<p>Gentiles to be damned, though people who know the Scriptures are more </p>
<p>damned than those who have only nature and conscience (2:14–18). God </p>
<p>revealed the truth about God within people (1:19), an internal knowledge </p>
<p>based on being made in God’s image (Gen 1:26–27). More generally, God </p>
revealed his power and divinity, as well as benevolence in providing cre-
<p>ation, so those who fail to recognize his power and character, worshiping </p>
<p>mere idols or human conceptions, are without excuse (1:20).</p>
<p>Even Gentile intellectuals could have followed Paul’s argument here. </p>
<p>Apart from the more skeptical Epicureans, most Greek and Roman intel-</p>
lectuals recognized divine design in nature;
<p>62</p>
<p>many reckoned as absurd</p>
<p>the alternatives, namely, that the universe resulted from chance or human </p>
<p>activity.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p> Various philosophers armed that the supreme deity was pres-</p>
<p>ent in and known by his works.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>Many of these writers also armed, like</p>
<p>Paul, that one could infer much about God’s character from creation. For </p>
<p>example, some believed that God’s character transcended merely human </p>
<p>religion,</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> or that deities were benevolent and cared for people.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>Paul</p>
<p>would not have endorsed all their inferences;</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> many of these philoso-</p>
<p>phers still accepted their culture’s belief in many deities. But many Stoic </p>
<p>61. e judgment of consequences of false belief appears elsewhere (cf. Isa 29:9–14; </p>
<p>Jub. 21:22; Josephus J . W. 5.343; Epictetus Disc. 1.12.21–22; 3.11.1–3; Porphyry Marc. </p>
<p>22.348–360).</p>
