<p>Israel’s Role and Salvation</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>with God’s word in the Torah (19:7–11).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Alternatively, Paul may make</p>
<p>a simple analogy about the gospel message becoming pervasive just as </p>
<p>creation’s testimony is (Rom 15:18–19; cf. Col 1:23).</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>More intelligible are the texts Paul cites for Israel’s disobedience in </p>
<p>10:19–21, each of which Paul applies to God welcoming outsiders in re-</p>
<p>lation to Israel’s disobedience. In 10:19 Paul quotes Deut 32:21, where </p>
<p>Israel made God jealous with idols, so God will make them jealous by a </p>
<p>nation that lacked his law.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>is concept becomes foundational for Paul’s</p>
<p>eschatological strategy: he believes that his successful Gentile mission </p>
<p>will provoke Israel’s jealousy, to motivate them to conversion (11:11, 14). </p>
<p>Paul then (in 10:20–21) cites Isa 65:1–2, where a nation not seeking God </p>
<p>(like the Gentiles of Rom 9:30) found him, an outcome that he contrasts </p>
<p>with Israel who rebelled.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>In Isaiah 65 the second verse may be parallel</p>
<p>to the rst, so that even 65:1 may originally refer to Israel rather than </p>
<p>Gentiles (cf. Rom 9:25–26). Nevertheless, Isaiah does include indications </p>
<p>of Gentile adherents being incorporated into Israel (Isa 56:3–8), even </p>
<p>nations welcomed as God’s people (Isa 19:24–25). Paul’s exegesis in this </p>
<p>section invites the objection that perhaps God has rejected Israel, an ob-</p>
<p>jection that he hastens to refute in 11:1–32.</p>
<p>12. Johnson 2001: 174, thinks it refers to reading of Scripture with messianic signi-</p>
<p>cance in the synagogues, not Christian proclamation (a task Paul still strove to complete, </p>
<p>15:20–24).</p>
<p>13. One could speak hyperbolically of a message spread “throughout the world,” not </p>
intending that every individual has heard (Pliny Ep. 6.10.3). Paul could thus intend “rep-
<p>resentative preaching” to all regions (Munck 1967: 98; Morris 1988: 393; Sanders 1993: </p>
<p>107).</p>
<p>14. Hays (1989: 83) notes that Paul may thus implicitly echo Israel’s lack of faith in </p>
<p>Deut 32:20 lxx.</p>
<p>15. By contrast, elsewhere in Romans Paul speaks of Gentiles’ obedience (1:5; 15:18; </p>
<p>16:25). For Paul’s use of Isaiah’s restoration theme, see further Wagner 2002: 29–33. </p>
<p>Because another part of Isa 65:1 speaks of “calling on the Lord’s name,” Paul possibly </p>
<p>connected it implicitly with Joel 2:32 cited in Rom 10:13, at least in his own mind (cf. </p>
<p>Grieb 2002: 104).</p>
