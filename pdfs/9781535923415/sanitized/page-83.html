<p>Made Right by Trusting Christ</p>

<p>dard way of driving home a theme. e cognate verb dikaioō also ap-</p>
<p>pears repeatedly (3:24, 26, 28, 30), providing an alternative for the lack </p>
<p>of justication provided by works of the law in 3:20. Paul shows how at </p>
<p>this juncture in salvation history (“now,” 3:21) God’s righteousness has </p>
<p>been revealed through faith (in contrast to attempts to be “righteoused” </p>
<p>by law; 3:20).</p>
<p>God’s righteousness is through the “faith of Jesus Christ” (3:22; also </p>
<p>3:26)—an expression that has occasioned enormous debate. e Greek </p>
<p>construction can mean Jesus’s own faith(fulness), or it can mean faith </p>
<p>in Jesus, and scholars have oered compelling arguments for both posi-</p>
<p>tions. Greek authors before and aer Paul felt free to use genitives both </p>
<p>subjectively (i.e., here “faith of Jesus”) and objectively (i.e., here “faith </p>
<p>in Jesus”).</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> In favor of it referring to Jesus’s own faith(fulness)</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>is the</p>
<p>centrality of his work (3:24–25); the parallel expression regarding God’s </p>
<p>faithfulness earlier in the chapter (3:3); and most compellingly, the pre-</p>
<p>cisely parallel expression to believers being of the faith of Jesus (3:26) and </p>
<p>the faith of Abraham (4:16).</p>
<p>In favor of the reading, “faith in Jesus” (the objective genitive),</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> </p>
<p>the noun is plainly connected with the verb in 3:22, where it involves </p>
<p>believers’ faith (also Gal 2:16).</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Although cognate nouns and verbs do</p>
<p>not always carry the same signicance, it seems likelier than not that they </p>
<p>do here (the verb appears six times in ch. 4), and in Romans Jesus is al-</p>
<p>ways the object of this verb rather than its example. In forty-two uses of </p>
<p>the verb in Romans we regularly read of believers’ faith in Jesus, yet we </p>
<p>nowhere in unambiguous terms read of Jesus’s own faith. Although Paul </p>
<p>could have written “faith in Jesus” more obviously, the genitive construc-</p>
<p>23. Harrisville 2006; objective genitives are more common with God’s name. us, </p>
<p>e.g., “knowledge of Jesus” is objective in Phil 3:8, allowing the same approach to “faith of </p>
<p>Jesus” in Phil 3:9 (Schreiner 1998: 183); but subjective genitives with faith dominate the </p>
<p>context of Rom 3–4 (3:3; 4:12, 16).</p>

<p>25. See e.g., Origen, Augustine, Abelard, T. Aquinas, M. Luther, B. Byrne, J. Dunn, J. </p>
<p>Fitzmyer, A. Hultgren, R. B. Matlock, D. Moo, T. Schreiner, T. Tobin; cf. F. Watson. Some </p>
<p>believe that Paul included both senses, though inclining toward the objective reading </p>
<p>(e.g., A. Schlatter, L. Morris, M. Reasoner, R. Jewett); another option is a genitive of </p>
<p>origin (faith enabled by Christ; D. Rusam; cf. Gal 2:20). For one history of views, see </p>
<p>Reasoner 2005: 7, 24, 27, 30, 38.</p>
<p>26. Far from being superuous on the objective genitive reading, it is emphatic (in </p>
<p>Rom 3:22; Gal 3:22; Phil 3:9).</p>
