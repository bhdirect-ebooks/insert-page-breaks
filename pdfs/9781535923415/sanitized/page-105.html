<p>Romans 6</p>
<p>Life in Christ and the Spirit (5:12—8:39), cont.</p>
<p>Dead to Sin, Alive in Christ (6:1–11)</p>
<p>As Paul in 5:1–11 applied to believers’ lives insights gleaned from </p>
<p>Abraham’s example in ch. 4, so in 6:1–11 Paul applies insights gleaned </p>
<p>from the contrast with Adam in 5:12–21. Paul’s detractors, who believe </p>
<p>that Gentiles should keep the law, consider him antinomian (3:8; Acts </p>
<p>21:21), apparently fearing that his view of the law will generate more sin. </p>
<p>Paul instead argues that by revealing sin law increased the level to which </p>
<p>sin is knowing revolt against God (Rom 5:20a)—but that God provided </p>
<p>grace more than commensurate with the sin (5:20b). Paul’s focus on grace </p>
<p>raises the objection: is Paul saying that one should sin all the more so all </p>
<p>the more grace may be added (6:1)? Paul retorts that the opposite is true: </p>
<p>grace delivers not merely from punishment, but from sin’s power. It is </p>
<p>empowering grace rather than law (as a standard), that transforms. It is </p>
<p>thus God’s gi rather than his standard that produces genuine righteous-</p>
<p>ness from the heart.</p>
<p>Why does Paul suddenly shi to speak of having “died” to sin in </p>
<p>Christ (6:2–11)? He has been pointing out how Adam introduced death to </p>
<p>humanity, whereas Christ brought life (5:12–21). ose who are in Christ </p>
<p>share his death (6:3–4), a death justly incurred by Adamic humanity’s </p>
<p>transgression (5:12, 15, 17, 21). But because Christ himself was righteous </p>
<p>yet embraced Adamic esh and death (8:3), he not only embodies death </p>
<p>to the old way, but inaugurates a new way of righteousness and life for </p>
<p>those united with him (5:18–19). ose who are in Christ are no longer </p>
<p>in the sphere of Adam, hence are “dead” to their former sin (6:5–7) and </p>
<p>even to death (6:8–10), at least in a proleptic way that will eect their </p>
<p>resurrection someday (6:5, 8; 8:23); Christ does not need to die again </p>
<p>(6:9–10). us the palaios anthrōpos, the “old person” crucied with </p>
