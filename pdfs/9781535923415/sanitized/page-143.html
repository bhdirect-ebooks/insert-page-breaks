<p>Israel’s Role and Salvation</p>
<p>117</p>
though Paul more oen prefers the divine title “Lord” for him (10:9–13; 1
<p>Cor 8:5–6; Phil 2:9–11 [with Isa 45:23]).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>By elsewhere applying most of these benets to all believers, Paul is </p>
<p>not denying the relationship of these benets to Israel’s heritage. Rather, </p>
<p>Gentiles who submit to Israel’s God-ordained king are graed into the </p>
<p>covenant, whereas Jews who do rebel against him are broken o. It is not </p>
<p>the covenant that changed, but some members of Israel (as throughout </p>
<p>Israel’s history) did not maintain their side of the covenant.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>In the ot,</p>
<p>Gentile adherents to the covenant were a smaller minority, but the obedi-</p>
<p>ent remnant of Israel could be either large (as in Joshua’s or David’s day) </p>
<p>or small (as in Moses’s or Ahab’s day). at so many Gentiles would be </p>
<p>welcomed (and without circumcision) might be a “mystery,” but it can be </p>
<p>made known from Scripture precisely because Gentiles had always been </p>
<p>welcome to join the covenant (16:25–26).</p>
<p>God’s Choice Not Bound by Ethnicity (9:6–29)</p>
<p>e conjunction of God’s promises (9:4–5) with Israel’s tragic alienation </p>
<p>(9:1–3) raises the issue of theodicy: has God’s promise failed (9:6)? Paul </p>
<p>responds that God’s covenant is secure, but it does not apply automatically </p>
<p>to all of Israel’s ethnic descendants (9:6).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>He demonstrates this premise</p>
<p>from unexpected yet undisputed historic examples: not all of Abraham’s </p>
<p>children received the promise (9:7–9), nor did all of Isaac’s (9:10–13). </p>
<p>(Ishmael was blessed, but not the primary line of descent; Esau received </p>
<p>even more limited blessing.)</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>e echoes of the Greek text of 9:7 in 9:29</p>
6. e matter is debated, but the title ts Pauline Christology of Jesus as divine,
<p>even though he usually prefers other wording (cf. e.g., comment on Rom 1:7). ose </p>
<p>skeptical that it refers to Christ include Byrne, Dunn, Johnson, Käsemann, Stuhlmacher; </p>
<p>those favoring a reference to Christ (currently the majority) include Origen; Craneld; </p>
<p>Cullmann 1959: 313; Fahy 1965; Jewett; Moo; Sanday and Headlam; Schlatter; see at </p>
<p>length Harris 1992: 143–72.</p>
<p>7. Cf. Hays 1989: 96–97 (Israel remains Israel, rather than there being a “new Israel,” </p>
<p>but Gentile believers are absorbed into it).</p>
<p>8. Paul could have also cited for this point judgment on the wilderness generation (as </p>
<p>in 1 Cor 10:5–10); Deuteronomy’s blessings and curses, and so forth.</p>
<p>9. Later rabbis counted both Ishmael and Esau as cha, but insisted that none of </p>
<p>Jacob’s sons were (Sipre Deut. 312.1.1; 343.5.2; Tg. Ps.-J. on Gen 35:22; cf. Jub. 15:30). </p>
<p>Esau appears particularly negatively in Jewish sources (e.g., Philo Alleg. Interp. 3.88; T. </p>
<p>Jud. 9:2; Pesiq. Rab Kah. 3:1), and later sources use him as a cipher for Rome (probably </p>
<p>4 Ezra 6:7–10; pervasively in third century and later rabbis; cf. Freedman 1995; Hadas-</p>
<p>Lebel 1984).</p>
