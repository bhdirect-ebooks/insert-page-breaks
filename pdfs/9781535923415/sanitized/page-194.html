<p>Romans 14:13–23</p>
<p>168</p>
<p>Just as the spirit of the law will never contradict a life genuinely fol-</p>
<p>lowing God’s Spirit (Gal 5:18, 23), it is by Spirit-lled character (Rom </p>
<p>14:17) rather than debates about foods that one serves Christ properly </p>
<p>(Rom 14:18; cf. Heb 13:9). Paul describes this service as “pleasing” to God </p>
<p>(as in 12:1–2) and tested and approved by people, a conventional combi-</p>
<p>nation for describing what is honorable to everyone (2 Cor 8:21).</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>Since</p>
God’s way is peace (Rom 14:17), believers (divided in Rome, as we have
<p>noted) should seek</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> “peace” (cf. Rom 12:18; 1 ess 5:13), hence recon-</p>
<p>ciliation and unity, and beyond that to “build one another up” (14:19). </p>
<p>“Building up”</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>contrasts with “tearing one another down” over foods</p>
<p>(14:20).</p>
<p>In light of the priorities specied in 14:19–20, foods are clean,</p>
<p>41</p>
<p> </p>
<p>hence neutral, but they become agents of evil if used in such a way as to </p>
<p>provoke another’s apostasy. Better to avoid not only unclean food, but </p>
<p>even (perhaps hypothetically in this case) all meat and wine, or anything </p>
<p>that could destroy a fellow believer (Rom 14:21; cf. 1 Cor 10:31–33). By </p>
<p>faith one can know that food is clean, so that one is not condemned un-</p>
<p>less through causing another to stumble (14:22). But the one who cannot </p>
<p>eat with condence that God has approved the food will disobey what </p>
<p>they genuinely believe is God’s will, hence fall into sin (14:23).</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>For</p>
<p>Paul, then, sin is not only a matter of behaviors, but of motives. A weak </p>
<p>conscience with weak faith would be healthier if it were strong, but such </p>
<p>maturation must come by persuasion regarding what is God’s will, not by </p>
<p>38. Prov 3:4 lxx; Polybius 22.10.8; 27.8.4; Chariton Chaer. 1.10.3; t. Šeqal. 2:2; Sipre </p>
<p>Deut. 79.1.1.</p>
<p>39. Possibly “pursue” here evokes 9:30–31, again implying faith as the right way to </p>
<p>pursue righteousness. “Pursuing peace” also evokes Ps 34:14, as in 1 Pet 3:11. Both the al-</p>
<p>lusion and the context support reading the subjunctive “let us” rather than the indicative </p>
<p>“we do” here (mishearing a vowel was a common scribal error, as we noted at 5:1).</p>
<p>40. A frequent Pauline metaphor regarding God’s people (15:20; 1 Cor 3:9; 8:1, 10; </p>
<p>10:23; 14:3–26; 2 Cor 10:8; 12:19; 13:10; 1 ess 5:11), borrowed from the ot (Jer 1:10; </p>
<p>24:6; 31:28; 42:10).</p>
<p>41. A Stoic could speak of some foods as “pure” in the sense that they were not heavy, </p>
<p>weighing down the soul (Musonius Rufus 18A, p. 112.27–28), but the idea in 14:20 is </p>
<p>the Jewish idea of ritual purity, since speaking of koinos in 14:14 makes sense only on </p>
<p>Jewish terms.</p>
<p>42. Some other Jewish teachers addressed the concern of doubtful issues that, while </p>
<p>not necessarily sinful in themselves, could allow a negligent person to slide into sin (e.g., </p>
<p>’Abot R. Nat. 30A; ’Abot R. Nat. 32, §72B; cf. the rabbinic “fence around the Torah” in m. </p>
<p>’Ab ot 1:1; Moore 1971: vol. 1, 259).</p>
