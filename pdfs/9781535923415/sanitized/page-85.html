<p>or generosity) would imply benefaction; their coupling here underlines </p>
the emphasis on the divine initiative on which believers can depend.
<p>e content of the benefaction involves “redemption,” a term denoting </p>
<p>the liberation of slaves, as in the exodus.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>(e cognate verb in the lxx</p>
<p>sometimes, but not always, includes a ransom price, as typically in earlier </p>
<p>Greek; the context here might suggest Jesus’s blood as such a price.)</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>experience of redemption is completed in the future (Rom 8:23; cf. Eph </p>
<p>1:14; 4:30; Luke 21:38; 1QM 15.1–2), but here involves what Christ has </p>
<p>already done, lled out in the freedom from slavery image of 6:6–23 (cf. </p>
<p>7:25; 8:15, 21).</p>
<p>God’s righteousness attested by Scripture (3:21) and involving faith </p>
<p>in Jesus (3:22) was demonstrated in Jesus’s redemptive death (3:24–25). </p>
<p>Whereas God had previously displayed mercy, he now demonstrated his </p>
<p>righteousness by being both righteous (or just) and by putting believers </p>
<p>in Jesus right with him (3:25–26; see comment on 1:17).</p>
<p>Paul then appeals to a dierent biblical image, namely, the cover of </p>
<p>the ark of the covenant (hilastērion in 3:25; see Exod 25:17–22 and else-</p>
<p>where in the lxx; Heb 9:5), a translation earlier recognized by Origen, </p>
<p>Luther, and Tyndale, among others. God “planned”</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>Jesus as the “mercy</p>
<p>seat” or ark cover. But what is the point of Paul’s comparison? Granted, </p>
Jesus is the locus of the divine presence, but, as many have noted, the
<p>following mention of his “blood” strongly suggests an allusion to the an-</p>
<p>nual consecration of this holy place through sacricial blood on the Day </p>
<p>of Atonement (Lev 16:14–15).</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>By Jesus’s own blood, God consecrated</p>
<p>29. In 1 Cor 1:30 Paul may associate redemption with other salvic concepts; the </p>
<p>dierent term in Gal 3:13 and 4:5 might carry a similar sense, except emphasizing the </p>
<p>cost. Eph 1:7 and Col 1:14 (which I treat as Pauline, and which are otherwise our earliest </p>
<p>extant interpretation of Paul) associate redemption with forgiveness.</p>
<p>30. Cf. redemption by Jesus’s sacricial blood in Heb 9:14–15; 1 Pet 1:18–19; perhaps </p>
<p>Rev 1:5; 5:9. Many church fathers viewed Christ’s death as a ransom from the devil, but </p>
<p>this interpretation seems inconsistent with the sacricial connotations of Jesus’s death in </p>
<p>this context (which they also could recognize).</p>
<p>31. e same term appears with this sense in Rom 1:13; Eph 1:9; the term also means </p>
<p>“display publicly.” Although some suggest levitical connotations (Exod 29:23; 40:4, 23; </p>
<p>Lev 24:8; 2 Macc 1:8), it has a broader sense.</p>
<p>32. Cf. Jesus’s death and cognate atonement language in Heb 2:17 (in view of Heb </p>
<p>7:27; 9:26; 10:10–12); 1 John 2:2; 4:10. It might also allude to the eschatological re-con-</p>
<p>secration (Ezek 43:20). Against Dodd and those who have followed him, who doubt that </p>
<p>the lxx used cognate language for genuinely propitiating God’s wrath, as in pagan Greek, </p>
<p>Scripture spoke both of God’s wrath and of particular oerings propitiating it, a nuance </p>
