<p>Fusing the Horizons: Boasting against Other Branches</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>faithfulness expressed in his covenant with Israel, Paul’s concern about ar-</p>
<p>rogance against Jewish branches (11:18) also offers relevant advice for any </p>
<p>peoples who treat God’s favor as a permanent ethnic possession. Historically, </p>
<p>Christianity itself shifted from especially north Africa and Anatolia to Europe </p>
<p>and east Africa, and later elsewhere. In the past century its center has shifted </p>
<p>from the West to the Global South. Paul’s concern is relevant even more gener-</p>
<p>ally to interactions between believers and nonbelievers: those who were saved </p>
<p>by grace dare not look down on others, but should welcome them graciously </p>
<p>as they have been welcomed.</p>
