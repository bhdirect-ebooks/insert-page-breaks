<p>Romans 2:17–24</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>Ancients considered temple robbery (2:22) the epitome of impiety.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many Gentiles suspected Jews of this crime because they knew that they </p>
<p>did not regard pagan temples as sacred,</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> though Jewish apologists em-</p>
<p>phasized that good Jews would do no such thing.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Here Paul’s hyperbolic</p>
<p>opponent, far from abhorring idols, apparently nds their sale lucrative. </p>
<p>Profaning God’s name (2:23–24) was among the most heinous of oens-</p>
<p>es.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>e sort of hypocritical Jew who discredited God and his people</p>
<p>depicted here could be familiar enough to Paul’s audience: a generation </p>
<p>earlier, one Jewish charlatan, who professed to teach Moses’s laws but did </p>
<p>not obey them, had exploited Roman women, leading to scandal in Rome </p>
<p>(Josephus Ant. 18.81–84).</p>
<p>As at some other points in Romans (e.g., 3:10–18), Paul uses the </p>
<p>Scriptures in what may be a deliberately unexpected way. In the context </p>
<p>of Isa 52:5 God’s name was blasphemed among Gentiles because of his </p>
<p>people’s suering; here, Paul complains, God is blasphemed because of </p>
<p>their sin! ey were exiled to begin with, however, because of their sin </p>
<p>(cf. Ezek 36:18–20). Paul might connect this passage with many of his </p>
<p>people’s rejection of the good news of Isa 52:7 (cited in Rom 10:15.)</p>
<p>Inward Jewishness (2:25–29)</p>
<p>Responding to one boasting in his Jewish ethnicity and virtues (2:17–24), </p>
<p>Paul counters that Jewishness (here embodied in circumcision) is valu-</p>
<p>able only if one truly keeps the covenant. Gentiles who follow the moral </p>
<p>demands of the law, even if they lack knowledge of the written law (or </p>
<p>are uncircumcised Godfearers attached to the synagogue), will be reck-</p>
<p>oned more within the covenant than Jews who break the law. Although </p>
<p>Paul again speaks in principle of any Gentile, in practice those who could </p>
<p>fulll this standard, from Paul’s perspective, are those who are in Christ, </p>
<p>since they are the ones who have the Spirit (cf. 2:29 with 7:5–6; 8:9).</p>
