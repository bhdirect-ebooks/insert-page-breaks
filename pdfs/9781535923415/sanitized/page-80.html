<p>Romans 3:9–20</p>

<p>conclusion he draws: those who sin are lost, even if they belong to the </p>
<p>chosen people.</p>
<p>One could not counter Paul’s argument in 3:1–8 with the objection </p>
<p>that Jews were morally superior</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>to Gentiles (3:9). While on points like</p>
<p>sexual immorality Jews generally were morally superior, Paul holds those </p>
<p>with greater knowledge of the law to a higher standard (2:12), and includes </p>
<p>sins of the heart (cf. 2:16), which are stirred all the more by repressing </p>
<p>them (7:7–8). Paul notes in 3:9 that he has already established that both </p>
<p>Jews and Gentiles are under sin; there was little point claiming to be su-</p>
<p>perior to another when both were under sin’s dominion. While Paul has </p>
<p>already oered a general argument to this eect based on a hypothetical </p>
<p>Jewish sinner (2:17–29), he now argues more generally from Scripture.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>In 3:10–18 Paul piles up texts (most of them from the Psalms) about </p>
<p>the common sinfulness of humanity.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Apart from a few collections of</p>
<p>ancient texts (such as at Qumran), few directly linked texts at such great </p>
<p>length as here, and even the longer collections oen addressed sections </p>
of Scripture rather than topics, and rarely “blended” diverse texts into a
<p>medley. Yet just as Jewish midrash regularly linked texts based on a com-</p>
<p>mon key word or concept, Paul links all these texts not only by their refer-</p>
<p>ence to sin but by other means as well. First, some of these texts allude </p>
<p>somehow to death (3:13ac, 15–17), a theme that will recur (5:12, 14, 17, </p>
<p>21; 6:16, 21, 23; 7:5, 10, 13, 24; 8:6).</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Second, most allude to body parts:</p>
<p>eyes (3:18), feet (3:15–17), and perhaps appropriately rst and at great-</p>
<p>est length, the mouth (3:13–14).</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Mention of parts of the body might</p>
<p>11. Technically, Paul’s use of the middle here probably signies protecting oneself </p>
<p>rather than superiority, hence might involve the notion of protection from God’s wrath </p>
<p>(BDAG). Alternatively, if read as a passive, the interlocutor objects that Paul’s argument </p>
<p>puts Jews at a disadvantage, but Paul equalizes all.</p>
<p>12. Others also used quotations to argue that sin was widespread (Seneca Ben. 5.15.3; </p>
<p>Nat. 4.pref. 19), though Paul’s argument here seems more forceful. An argument claim-</p>
<p>ing “all” when it proved only “most” could be technically defective (Rhet. Her. 2.20.32), </p>
<p>though hyperbole would stand in both diatribe and polemical rhetoric.</p>
<p>13. In rhetoric, repeating a thought reinforced it.</p>
<p>14. Graves’ uncleanness might also suggest deling speech; on the danger of tongues </p>
<p>like serpents, e.g., Pliny Nat. 18.1.4; Rhet. Her. 4.49.62; perhaps Ps 58:3–4.</p>
<p>15. Paul has just mentioned slander (3:8)! Signicant for rhetorical eect, Paul also </p>
<p>links some texts with an initial “there is not” (six lines) and a closing “their” in Greek </p>
<p>(four lines; Jewett 2007: 254), though in some cases he adapts the wording slightly (as </p>
<p>was common) to t the rhetorical pattern.</p>
