<p>Romans 13:1–7</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>cept with trust in God’s gracious providence.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>But no one assumed that</p>
<p>such language was absolute; Stoics themselves would not compromise </p>
<p>their integrity for the state, but submitted to what they believed the state </p>
<p>should be.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Paul speaks here of the moral function of civil government in</p>
<p>restraining evil (13:3–5), a function shared with laws in general, which </p>
<p>includes their role in punishing errant citizens (13:4).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>While believers</p>
<p>must not avenge themselves (12:19), the state is right to avenge wrong-</p>
<p>doing (13:4), at least for the sake of public order (cf. Deut 13:11; 17:13; </p>
<p>19:20; 21:21). Christians must submit to the state not only because of such </p>
<p>punishments, however, but because they recognize that God appointed </p>
<p>such rulers (13:5). Writing a few years before nationalist Judeans sought </p>
<p>liberation from Rome by military means, Paul articulates instead a dif-</p>
<p>ferent prophetic view, that God expects his people to live in the societies </p>
<p>where he has placed them (Jer 29:4–7).</p>
<p>Clearly Paul does not believe that Christians must always agree </p>
<p>with governments. He would have warned against participation in the </p>
“patriotic” emperor cult (cf. 3:29–30), and he recognized Moses’s divinely
<p>commanded opposition to Pharaoh (cf. 9:15–17). But as a general rule, </p>
<p>including in a pagan and unjustly structured society like the Roman </p>
<p>Empire, he expected Christians to be model citizens. is does not mean </p>
<p>that they should not work for change by evangelizing and seeking justice, </p>
<p>but we should keep in mind that Paul’s audience did not have all the same </p>
<p>recourses for political transformation available in a modern democracy, </p>
<p>and they were a small minority movement in any case.</p>
<p>Moral exceptions like abstention from the emperor cult do not ab-</p>
<p>solve Christians from paying taxes or customs (13:6–7). Taxes helped to </p>
<p>fund Roman armies, which did evil as well as maintained order, and state </p>
<p>cults. Nevertheless, Christians had to support their societies. In a society </p>
<p>that emphasized honor and shame, showing honor to leaders was impor-</p>
<p>tant (believers obeying 12:10 would already have practice relinquishing </p>
<p>honor to others). Some noncitizens in Rome may have resented the taxes </p>
<p>levied on them. Some have pointed out that the Jews expelled by Claudius </p>
<p>would have been taxed as immigrants once they returned to Rome, and </p>
<p>10. Cf. e.g., Seneca Lucil. 96.1–2; Marcus Aurelius Med. 4.25; 5.27.</p>
<p>11. E.g., for disputes about obeying orders not in the giver’s own interests or intentions, </p>
<p>see e.g., Musonius Rufus 16, p. 102.28–31 (with parents); Aulus Gellius Noct. att. 1.13.</p>
<p>12. Probably also the “condemnation” of 13:2. During the Empire Rome decapitated </p>
<p>citizens by the sword (Seneca Dial. 3.18.4; m. Sanh. 7:3).</p>
