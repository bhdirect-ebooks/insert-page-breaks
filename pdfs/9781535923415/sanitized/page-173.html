<p>Living the Christian Life</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>to “lead” or “manage” (proistēmi) in house churches received respect for </p>
<p>their position (1 ess 5:12), though even most well-endowed homes did </p>
<p>not seat beyond forty persons. Finally, “showing mercy” reects compas-</p>
<p>sionate help, including alms;</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Paul elsewhere associates “cheerfulness”</p>
<p>with economic charity (2 Cor 9:7). at at least two members of the ad </p>
<p>hoc list may be associated with nancial help to others might suggest that </p>
<p>some Roman believers had resources (cf. also Rom 15:24). ough all </p>
<p>believers are called to share nancially (12:13), God has gied some in </p>
<p>particular with means and the heart to do it abundantly.</p>
<p>Loving Everyone (12:9–21)</p>
<p>In 12:9–21 Paul oers “paranesis,” a series of loosely tted exhortations, </p>
<p>most of them widely paralleled elsewhere in the ancient world.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Although</p>
<p>by their nature such exhortations are of general signicance, Paul still </p>
<p>writes with the Roman believers in mind. In 12:9–13 he urges loving and </p>
<p>serving fellow believers; in 12:14–21 he addresses relationships with peo-</p>
<p>ple more generally, preparing for relationships with the state in 13:1–7. </p>
<p>Paul frames 12:9–21 with exhortations to choose “good” rather than evil </p>
<p>(12:9, 21); he has already shown that what is “good” is the will of God </p>
<p>(12:2), and will continue encouraging them to do “good” in 13:3–4.</p>
<p>Because of the limited size of this commentary and the number of </p>
individual exhortations, I address only some of these individually. First,
<p>in 12:9–10 Paul addresses the character of sincere love (a theme revisited </p>
<p>in 13:8–10), which expresses itself in part in honoring others above one-</p>
<p>self (a value that ran counter to most conventional Mediterranean values </p>
<p>for men.)</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>In 12:10–12 Paul employs an accepted form of repetition (here, start-</p>
<p>ing each Greek clause with a dative noun) to drive home his emphasis </p>
<p>17. e term involves helping the needy (sick, poor, etc.; T. Iss. 5:2; T. Benj. 4:4; </p>
<p>Craneld, Romans, 2:627). Paul’s normal use of the term for God’s activity, including in </p>
<p>Romans, seems relevant, if at all, at most as a model here.</p>
