<p>cutting themselves o through apostasy. Judaism was thus a religion of </p>
<p>grace, and works conrmed rather than earned a place in the covenant.</p>
<p>One complication of revisiting ancient Judaism’s approach to works </p>
<p>and grace is that one must then revisit Paul’s approach to the views of </p>
<p>his contemporaries on these matters. Paul does in fact sound like he re-</p>
<p>gards his contemporaries’ approach as based on human eort rather than </p>
<p>grace, so New Testament scholars set out to reinterpret Paul based on this </p>
<p>new interpretation of ancient Judaism. Many found Sanders’s reconstruc-</p>
<p>tion of ancient Judaism more plausible than his interpretation of Paul, </p>
<p>but James D. G. Dunn, Hans Hübner, Heikki Räisänen, Francis Watson, </p>
<p>N. T. Wright, and others also oered new readings of Paul in his Jewish </p>
<p>setting.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Some of these new interpretations became known as the “New</p>
Perspective,” but the new perspectives are in fact so diverse on various
<p>points of detail that the main characteristic of their newness is that they </p>
<p>reject the older caricature of Judaism.</p>
<p>While Sanders’s challenge to caricatures of Judaism proved to be </p>
<p>an important watershed, many of the details of his approach have come </p>
<p>under increasing challenge. Sanders’s primary thesis, the prevalence of </p>
<p>grace in Judaism (and perhaps especially rabbinic Judaism, where it was </p>
<p>oen least appreciated), won the day, and there is little likelihood, barring </p>
<p>a nuclear holocaust or other cataclysmic event that wipes out the cur-</p>
<p>rent generation of scholars and our work, that the bulk of nt scholarship </p>
<p>will backtrack on that point. Yet scholars have increasingly noticed that </p>
<p>another side of the picture, “works righteousness,” remains in the Jewish </p>
<p>sources. A number of scholars argue that Sanders’s way of framing the </p>
<p>questions (in response to more traditional ways of framing them) and </p>
<p>arranging the data downplayed the sources’ emphasis on earning merit or </p>
<p>even eschatological salvation.</p>
