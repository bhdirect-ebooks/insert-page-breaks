<p>Introduction</p>

<p>ence was “among the Gentiles” (Rom 1:5); they were least partly Gentile </p>
<p>(11:13) and probably mostly Gentile (1:13; cf. 16:4). Many contend that </p>
<p>Jewish believers and God-fearing Gentiles</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>remained in the synagogues</p>
<p>in Rome for some time, explaining why Paul can presuppose so much </p>
<p>knowledge of Scripture and Jewish perspective in the letter (cf. 7:1). At </p>
<p>some point in the 40s CE the Jewish community in Rome was apparently </p>
divided over questions of the identity of the Messiah, probably Jesus. As
<p>a result, the emperor Claudius followed the precedent of the earlier em-</p>
<p>peror Tiberius and banished the Jews from Rome (cf. the garbled account </p>
<p>in Suetonius Claud. 25.4). Given the context in our sources, this may have </p>
<p>happened in about the year 49 CE.</p>
<p>Scholars debate whether the entire Jewish community actually le; </p>
<p>it would be dicult to reclaim property, hence dicult to imagine gen-</p>
<p>erations of Jewish occupation coming to a complete end, then resuming </p>
<p>their lives in Rome aer Claudius’s edict was repealed (on his death in 54 </p>
<p>CE). Certainly the many Jews who were Roman citizens would not have </p>
<p>been expelled. Nevertheless, Luke, like Suetonius, speaks of Jews being </p>
<p>expelled (Acts 18:2, though prudently omitting the cause). Whether all </p>
<p>were expelled (and whether all who were ocially expelled actually le), </p>
<p>at least those visible in the original conict must have le. Luke indicates </p>
<p>that Priscilla and Aquila, Jews in Rome who were apparently already be-</p>
<p>lievers (and possibly church leaders) when Paul met them, had le. It is </p>
<p>likely that a substantial number of Jewish Christians, and perhaps all their </p>
<p>leaders, le Rome at this point. is means that Gentile Christians had </p>
<p>probably constituted the bulk of the Roman church and its leadership </p>
<p>for at least ve years, and may represent a number of the house churches </p>
<p>greeted in Romans 16. (ose with Jewish leaders, as in 16:5, 7, may have </p>
<p>organized aer many Jews returned.)</p>
<p>Given the dierent cultural orientation of congregations in the same </p>
<p>city, probably at least as loosely connected as the dierent synagogues, </p>
<p>it is not surprising that misunderstandings would arise between groups </p>
<p>with a predominantly Jewish ethos. Some Gentiles (especially former </p>
<p>24. Rome’s synagogues had many Godfearers to begin with; proselytism and at-</p>
<p>traction to Judaism constituted major causes of resentment among traditional Romans </p>
<p>against Roman Judaism (see Parkes 1979: 25–26; Gager 1983: 55–56). For proselytes in </p>
<p>Rome, see e.g., Leon 1960: 250–56. Nanos (1996) argues that the believers in Rome, who </p>
<p>are Gentiles, remain in the synagogues, so that Paul encourages them to honor Jewish </p>
<p>concerns.</p>
