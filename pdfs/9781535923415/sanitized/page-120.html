<p>pulse.</p>

<p>Some Diaspora Jews also argued that the law enabled one to rule</p>
<p>one’s passions.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Here, by contrast, evil so dominates the person that the</p>
<p>law known to the mind cannot stave o sin’s exploitation of the law in the </p>
<p>esh. Some of Paul’s language ts the portrayal of pathetic enslavement to </p>
<p>passion in Greek sources (most oen compared with wicked Medea’s or </p>
<p>Phaedra’s submission to passion rather than reason).</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>Paul’s application</p>
<p>of the language in this context, however, shockingly applies to a pious Jew </p>
<p>trying to observe God’s law.</p>
<p>e mind and inner person recognizes what is right, knowing God’s </p>
<p>law (7:16, 22–23).</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>But whereas many ancient thinkers (especially Stoics)</p>
<p>felt that proper knowledge would produce transformation,</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>Paul denies</p>
<p>that knowledge apart from God’s Spirit can produce righteousness (cf. </p>
<p>8:2–4). Righteousness must be God’s gi alone (4:11; 5:17; 10:3), and hu-</p>
<p>mans cannot boast in their own righteousness before God (3:27; 4:2).</p>
<p>e inability to submit to God’s law in this passage is summarized </p>
<p>as characteristic of the mental framework dominated by the esh in 8:5. </p>
<p>While the mind and inner person of 7:22–23 knows what is good, it is </p>
<p>dominated by issues raised by the bodily members (7:23), hence is the </p>
<p>mindset of the esh (8:5). Like one enslaved by sin in 6:16–20, the mind </p>
<p>here is defeated in battle (contrast 6:13; 13:12) and made a prisoner of </p>
<p>war.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> Prisoners of war were normally enslaved if they were not ran-</p>
<p>23. E.g., Sipre Deut. 45.1.2; ’Abot R. Nat. 16A; b. Qidd. 30b, bar.; Tg. Qoh. on 10:4; for </p>
<p>the law vs. sin, cf. also m. ’Abot 4:2; m. Qidd. 1:10. God’s help was needed (e.g., 4Q436 </p>
<p>f1a+bi:10; Sipre Num. 40.1.3).</p>
<p>24. 4 Macc 2:21–23. One destroys the evil impulse by good works in T. Ash. 3:2.</p>
<p>25. See e.g., Euripides Med. 1077–80; Seneca Med. 926–30, 988–90; see more ex-</p>
<p>tensively Renehan 1973: 24–26; Gill 1998: 121, 137; Stowers 1994: 260–63; Tobin 2004: </p>
<p>232–34. Given the denigration in some ancient sources of the feminine as irrational (cf. </p>
<p>Gemünden 1997), the analogy would be all the more shocking.</p>
<p>26. e more positive portrayal of the inner person in 2 Cor 4:16 (cf. also Eph 3:16) </p>
<p>depicts Paul’s state as a believer (in contrast to here); on the background of “inner per-</p>
<p>son,” see the views in Aune 2001: 220–22; Markschies 1994; Betz 2000.</p>
<p>27. Cf. Epictetus Disc. 1.28.6; 2.17.21–22; Tobin 2004: 235; but note Arius Didymus </p>
<p>Epit. 2.7.10a, pp. 56–57.24–33; Musonius Rufus 6, p. 52.15–17. Stoics also armed the </p>
<p>value of law (Arius Didymus Epit. 2.7.11d, p. 68.1–7; 2.7.11i, p. 76.30–37).</p>
<p>28. If 6:16–20 involves self-enslavement, as many commentators think, the experi-</p>
<p>ence under the law here might be more brutal. Others also employed the image of waging </p>
<p>war with the passions (Xenophon Mem. 1.2.24; Dio Chrysostom Or. 8.20; Ps.-Diogenes </p>
<p>Ep. 5, 12; cf. m. ’Abot 4:1; Schechter 1961: 272–73) and passions taking one as an enslaved </p>
<p>prisoner (Maximus of Tyre Or. 36.4), including of war (Dio Chrysostom Or. 32.90; </p>
