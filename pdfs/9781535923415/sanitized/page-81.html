<p>Made Right by Trusting Christ</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>prepare for Paul’s later treatment of “esh” (cf. 6:6; 7:5, 24–25; 8:10, 13; </p>
<p>Col 3:5).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul rst quotes Ps 14:1–3 (13:1–3 lxx); because it has two identical </p>
<p>lines (“there is no one who does kindness,” 14:1, 3), Paul changes the rst </p>
<p>to “no one righteous” (probably based on Eccl 7:20), underlining the link </p>
<p>with his own larger argument.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>en Paul quotes Pss 5:9; 140:3; 10:7; Isa</p>
<p>59:7–8; and nally Ps 36:1. Only Paul’s use of Isa 59:7–8 in Rom 3:15–17 </p>
<p>in its original context applied to Israel as a whole (at least in Isaiah’s gen-</p>
<p>eration); perhaps the midrashic linking of these texts allows Paul to apply </p>
<p>that principle to the other references as well. While the psalm texts con-</p>
<p>textually addressed the psalmist’s enemies, Paul uses them to indict Israel </p>
<p>as a whole on the principle that Scripture proclaims these matters to those </p>
<p>who are under the law (3:19). Again, it especially indicts those who have </p>
<p>the greatest knowledge and responsibility (cf. Amos 3:2).</p>
<p>Because the law condemns those under it,</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>every mouth, including</p>
<p>Jewish ones, will be silenced (3:19). Like the rest of the world, the hypo-</p>
<p>thetical objector of 3:5–8 will have nothing to argue in the day of judg-</p>
<p>ment, when God will be shown righteous in his judgment (3:4, 6, 8).</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e law is not meant to transform sinners into righteous people (cf. 8:3), </p>
<p>but to reveal God’s righteous standard (3:20; though see also comment on </p>
<p>3:21; 8:2). at is, the law shows people their sinfulness, as Paul has just </p>
<p>exemplied in 3:10–18. Paul’s words also allude to Ps 143:2, which pleads </p>
<p>for God’s mercy because “no one living [here, no esh] will be reckoned </p>
<p>righteous” in his sight.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>16. Cf. this use of body parts in Maximus of Tyre Or. 7.7; Porphyry Marc. 33.506–7; </p>
<p>Amoraim in Urbach 1979: 1:473. In the rhetorical gure synecdoche, a part could stand </p>
<p>for the whole (Anderson 2000: 112).</p>
<p>17. Some manuscripts of our current Greek translation of Ps 14:3 are considerably </p>
<p>longer than a normal verse and essentially include the rest of Paul’s quotation, in contrast </p>
<p>to the Hebrew version; but this expanded version presumably reects Christian scribes’ </p>
<p>knowledge of Paul’s quotation here.</p>
<p>18. e law’s speech reects the rhetorical device prosōpopoiia.</p>
<p>19. Cf. also the mouths in 3:13–14 (and slander in 3:8), but the silencing of humanity </p>
<p>before God’s judgment is a wider motif (Isa 41:1; Zeph 1:7; 2:13; cf. Beale 1999: 446–52). </p>
<p>e view that Paul addresses only Gentiles here runs precisely counter to Paul’s point </p>
<p>(3:9, 19–20).</p>
<p>20. As Hays (1989: 51–52) points out, the context in Ps 143:1 appeals to God’s </p>
<p>righteousness and faithfulness, relevant to this context (Rom 3:3, 5), and especially to </p>
<p>Scripture revealing God’s righteousness in Rom 3:21 (see also Hays 1980: 114–15).</p>
