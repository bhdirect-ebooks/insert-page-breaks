<p>Israel’s Role and Salvation</p>

<p>Jewish members (11:18).</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>(e Gentile boast in 11:19 might be a sort of</p>
<p>predestinarian parallel to the exaggerated Jewish boast in 2:17–20.) e </p>
<p>key issue was faith, which was why Gentiles as well as Jews could qualify </p>
<p>(11:20, 23). Gentile anti-Judaism was common (including Roman con-</p>
<p>tempt for circumcision and foreign customs in Rome), and Paul may seek </p>
<p>to head o its presence among Gentiles in the church (perhaps especially </p>
<p>threatening since churches formed without most of their Jewish element </p>
<p>between 49 and 54 CE).</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>God’s “kindness” (11:22) recalls his patient mercy bringing some </p>
<p>to repentance (2:4), while his “severity” involves cutting o unbeliev-</p>
<p>ing branches (hence those unfaithful to the covenant). Essentially, Paul </p>
<p>compares believing Gentile branches to vessels of mercy like Moses, and </p>
<p>unbelieving Jewish branches to objects of wrath like Pharaoh (9:15–18, </p>
<p>22–23). e issue, however, is faith (faithfulness to the covenant, depend-</p>
<p>ing on God) rather than ethnicity, as Paul will make clear in 11:23–24. </p>
<p>When he describes Israel as “natural” branches (11:21, 24; cf. 2:27) he </p>
<p>is not demeaning such connections, though they matter less than spiri-</p>
<p>tual connections (2:29). God also designed what accords with “nature” </p>
<p>(1:26–27; 2:14).</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Perhaps thinking of cultural heritage, Paul contends that Jewish </p>
<p>believers t more naturally into the covenant than Gentile believers do </p>
<p>(11:23–24). Plant images for Israel (e.g., Jer 24:6; Jub. 36:6) or the rem-</p>
<p>nant (e.g., 1QS 8.5) were common,</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>including as an olive tree (Jer 11:16,</p>
<p>Hos 14:6).</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> As current commentators note, sources from Paul’s day con-</p>
<p>rm that branches from wild olive trees could be graed into cultivated </p>
<p>trees; in the same way, foreigners to Israel’s covenant could become part </p>
<p>18. Katakauchaomai means “boast against,” but hearers of the letter in Greek would </p>
<p>not mistake the connection with kauchaomai earlier in the letter. In Pauline theology, </p>
<p>“boasting” (possible in Jewish practice, Gal 6:13–14; Phil 3:3) is in no way a particularly </p>
<p>Jewish oense (1 Cor 1:29–31; 3:21; 4:7; 2 Cor 11:12). Although Paul employs harsher </p>
<p>terms for arrogance and boasting in Rom 1:30, the hearer might also recall these.</p>
<p>19. e temptation was present; as Grieb notes (Grieb 2002: 108), Marcion severed </p>
<p>Christian beliefs completely from Judaism in Rome less than a century later.</p>
<p>20. Less attering is Paul’s language of connections according to the “esh” (2:28; 4:1; </p>
<p>9:3; 11:14; esp. 9:8), but this, too, need not be negative (1:3; 9:5; 15:27).</p>
<p>21. See also Tiller 1997.</p>
<p>22. A synagogue in Rome was apparently called the olive tree (though Leon 1960: </p>
<p>146–47 thinks the reason obscure); on tree symbolism generally, see Goodenough </p>
<p>1953–68: 7:87–134.</p>
