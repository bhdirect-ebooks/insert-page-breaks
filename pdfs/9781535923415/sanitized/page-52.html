<p>Romans 1:16–17</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>ture (1 Cor 1:18–23).</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>e world’s hostility could provide temptation to</p>
<p>be ashamed (cf. 2 Tim 1:8, 12, 16; 1 Pet 4:16), but God’s servants could </p>
<p>trust that they would not be shamed eschatologically (Rom 5:5; 9:33; </p>
<p>10:11).</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>“Unashamed” may also constitute litotes; Paul is positively eager</p>
<p>to preach this message (cf. Phil 1:20; Heb 2:11; 11:16).</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>God’s “power” for salvation might recall his “power” to create (1:20), </p>
<p>act in history (9:17, 22), or provide miraculous attestation (15:19). But it </p>
<p>especially recalls his power to raise the dead (1:4, including a central point </p>
<p>of the gospel message; cf. Eph 1:19–20), hence to transform by providing </p>
<p>new life (cf. Rom 15:13; 1 Cor 1:18). He may also think of the Spirit’s </p>
<p>activity in the gospel to convince people of the truth of the message (1 </p>
<p>Cor 2:4–5; 1 ess 1:5).</p>
<p>In the context (Rom 1:5, 13–15), Paul certainly wants to emphasize </p>
<p>that the gospel is for all peoples, Jew and Gentile alike.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>Yet there is also</p>
<p>a sense in which the good news, rooted in promises to Israel, is “to the </p>
<p>Jew rst”; it will take Paul all of chapters 9–11 to resolve the tension be-</p>
<p>tween these emphases. Paul’s evangelistic prioritization of ethnic Israel </p>
<p>ts Jesus’s teaching (Mark 7:27) and the portrayal of Paul’s own ministry </p>
<p>in Acts (e.g., 13:5; 28:17), yet he will argue that God saves both Jew and </p>
<p>Gentile by the same means.</p>
<p>Paul’s audience in Rome may inuence him in speaking of the gos-</p>
<p>pel going next to the “Greeks”:</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>they are mostly Gentiles (1:13), which</p>
<p>includes Greeks and barbarians (1:14), and of these two groups they are </p>
<p>largely the former (1:16). e Roman congregations were mostly Greek </p>
<p>speaking at this time (as the earliest Christian inscriptions and leader-</p>
<p>ship lists show). Romans also oen considered themselves “Greek” rather </p>
<p>than “barbarian,” which was not a attering designation. But Paul oen </p>
<p>employs the contrast between “Jew” and “Greek” (2:9–10; 3:9; 10:12), and </p>
<p>36. Cf. similarly Apollinaris of Laodicea (Bray 1998: 29); John Chrysostom. Hom. </p>
<p>Rom. 2.</p>
<p>37. Paul drew on Isa 28:16 lxx in two of these texts, and knew Isaiah’s broader expec-</p>
<p>tation (Isa 45:17; 54:4; 65:13; 66:5; see more fully Hays 1989: 38–39). He may have also </p>
<p>known Jesus’s saying in Mark 8:38 (cf. John 12:26).</p>
<p>38. E.g., Porter 1997: 579; cf. again John Chrysostom Hom. Rom. 2; on litotes, Rowe </p>
<p>1997: 128.</p>
<p>39. So also Origen Comm. Rom. on 1:16 (in Bray 1998: 30).</p>
<p>40. Paul may speak of the gospel going next to Greeks possibly because Greeks </p>
<p>(broadly dened, since Alexander) were the next ones to receive it; “Greeks” constituted </p>
<p>the primary mission eld of Paul’s day, at least in his cultural sphere.</p>
