<p>Introduction</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>not only in this letter (see 1 Cor 1:22, 24; 10:32; 12:13; Gal 3:28; Col 3:11; </p>
<p>cf. Acts 14:1; 18:4; 19:10, 17; 20:21), as equivalent to “Jew” and “Gentile” </p>
<p>(Rom 3:29; 9:24; 1 Cor 1:23). “Greek” provided a natural metonymy for </p>
<p>the larger category of “Gentile.” Josephus oen uses “Greeks” for all non-</p>
<p>Jewish urban residents,</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>and Jews had longstanding severe conicts with</p>
<p>Greeks, the dominant urban culture in the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>As the introductory “for” (gar) indicates, Paul now explains why </p>
<p>the good news brings salvation to Gentiles as well as Jews: God’s way of </p>
<p>implementing his righteousness is through faith (1:17). Scholars read this </p>
<p>explanation, however, in dierent ways, regarding both “God’s righteous-</p>
<p>ness” (dikaiosunē) and “faith” (pistis). Both are clearly key concepts: if </p>
<p>we include their cognates, Paul employs each term over y times in </p>
<p>Romans. Here I must digress to address dikaiosunē more fully.</p>
<p>Excursus: Dikaiosune¯ in Romans</p>
<p>In common Greek, dikaiosune¯ normally meant “justice.”</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>In what sense</p>
<p>would God’s “justice”</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>or “righteousness” (Rom 1:17; 3:5, 21–22; 10:3)</p>
<p>put people right with him (cf. 3:26)? Scripture often connects God’s righ-</p>
<p>teousness with his faithfulness and/or covenant love (e.g., Pss 36:5–6, 10; </p>
<p>40:10; 88:11–12; 98:2–3; 103:17; 111:3–4; 119:40–41; 141:1; 143:1, </p>
<p>11–12; 145:7). In the Psalms, God’s righteousness causes him to act justly </p>
<p>(e.g., Pss 31:1; 35:24) or mercifully (Pss 5:8; 71:2, 15–16, 19, 24; 88:12) </p>
<p>in favor of his servant. When forgiven, the psalmist will praise God’s righteous-</p>
<p>ness (Ps 51:14).</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>41. Rajak 1995: 1, 11–13; cf. Josephus Ant. 19.278. is is oen true of Luke as well </p>
<p>(e.g., Acts 14:1; 16:3).</p>
<p>42. For ethnic conicts between Jews and Greeks, see Stanley 1996.</p>
<p>43. Certainly appropriate in a thesis statement such as Rom 1:17; “justice” came </p>
<p>to be viewed as a standard category of reasoning for developing a thesis (Hermogenes </p>
<p>Progymn. 11, On esis 26).</p>
<p>44. “Justice” may depict an aspect of God’s nature as do God’s wrath (1:18) and God’s </p>
<p>power (1:20). Elliott (2008: 76–77) nds in God’s justice a critique of human injustice, </p>
<p>focusing on the empire.</p>
<p>45. God answering in righteousness (Ps 143:1) need not include judging, since no </p>
<p>mortal could meet God’s standard (Ps 143:2).</p>
