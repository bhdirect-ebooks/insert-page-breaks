<p>Life in Christ and the Spirit</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>live in a period of what some call “eschatological tension”: already they </p>
<p>walk in newness, delivered from sin, but they still await the resurrection </p>
<p>of their bodies (6:5; 8:23). As suggested in 5:12–21, once believers shared </p>
<p>the “image” or “likeness” of Adam (cf. 1:23; 5:14; 8:3; Phil 2:7; a cognate </p>
<p>in Gen 1:26), but now they share the likeness (homoiōma) of Jesus’s death </p>
<p>and will also share his resurrection (Rom 6:5; cf. 1 Cor 15:49).</p>
<p>In 6:6, Paul introduces the slave metaphor, which he will develop in </p>
<p>6:12–21 (cf also 7:6, 25; 8:15).</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Both slavery and manumission (freeing</p>
<p>slaves) were extremely common in Rome. Slavery was a common meta-</p>
<p>phor; ancient thinkers oen warned against being enslaved by passions </p>
<p>or false ideologies.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Like manumission, death ended one’s slavery (6:6),</p>
just as divorce (literally “freeing”) or death ended one’s being bound by
<p>marriage (7:2–3).</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Sin was the source of death (5:12–21). us, because</p>
<p>believers have been freed by Christ’s death from sin (6:6–7), their union </p>
<p>with Christ, who died once and now remains alive forever, guarantees </p>
<p>them future resurrection and eternal life (6:8–10).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>In 6:11, Paul climactically evokes his earlier arguments about righ-</p>
<p>teousness. Eleven times Paul speaks of God “reckoning” righteousness to </p>
<p>someone’s account in chapter 4. In 6:11, however, he summons believers </p>
<p>to agree with God’s perspective; as God has “reckoned” righteousness to </p>
<p>them, they must reckon themselves righteous. ey are righteous because </p>
<p>they are in Christ, in whom they both died to their identity as sinners </p>
<p>preceding context.</p>
<p>5. Dikaioō in 6:7 may continue the image of freedom if it plays on both Paul’s usual </p>
<p>sense of the term (making one right) and another possible (albeit related) sense, to “free” </p>
<p>one from claims against. Some note here a Jewish tradition that death cancels one’s </p>
<p>debts.</p>
<p>6. See e.g., the survey of metaphoric uses (with references) in Keener 2003b: 749–51. </p>
<p>For ideologies, see e.g., Plutarch Superst. 5, Mor. 167B; Ps.-Crates Ep. 16; for passions </p>
<p>or pleasure, see e.g., Xenophon Apol. 16 (Socrates on bodily passions); Plato Phaedrus </p>
<p>238E; Isocrates Ad Nic. 29 (Or. 2); Let. Aris. 277–78; T. Jos. 7:8; Josephus Ant. 1.74; idem </p>
<p>J . W. 1.243; Philo Heir 269; for the body, Philo Abraham 241; for sin, see e.g., T. Sim. 3:4; </p>
<p>T. Jud. 15:2.</p>
<p>7. Some point out how conversion, insofar as it eected a new identity, could theo-</p>
<p>retically eect manumission if not prevented (cf. b. Yeb am 45b–47b; Bamberger 1968: </p>
<p>127; Buchanan 1970: 206; for broader discussion of slaves’ immersion, see Hezser 2005: </p>
<p>35–41). Wright 1999: 28–29, citing 1 Cor 10:2 and the context of salvation history in </p>
<p>Romans, views Rom 6 as related to the exodus (also Allen 1964: 31; Daube 1969: 59–60; </p>
<p>for slavery and the exodus, see Hezser 2005: 363–76).</p>
<p>8. For martyrs “alive to God,” cf. 4 Macc 7:18–19.</p>
