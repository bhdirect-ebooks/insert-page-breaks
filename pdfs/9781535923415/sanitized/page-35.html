<p>Introduction</p>

<p>Jewish teacher (2:17–24) and his recycling of several more general texts </p>
<p>to regard all Jews as sinful (the Psalm texts in 3:10–20) would not ac-</p>
tually condemn every individual Jewish person. To notice this apparent
<p>anomaly is not to suggest that Paul would have relinquished his view that </p>
<p>all people were sinners (a view that most Jews shared anyway), but to </p>
<p>suggest that if had he written for a modern audience he sometimes would </p>
<p>have used a dierent style of argumentation. His rhetoric, no less than </p>
<p>his use of Greek language, is constructed to appeal specically within </p>
<p>a particular cultural setting. Such polemical rhetoric was expected and </p>
<p>necessary for successful debate in Paul’s day. Indeed, Paul fashions his </p>
<p>polemic in such a way that even his detractors would have been forced to </p>
<p>condemn the gure he caricatures. Today we can learn from Paul’s mes-</p>
<p>sage while aesthetically appreciating his plethora of gures of speech and </p>
<p>rhetorical devices that displayed his brilliance while holding his original </p>
<p>audience’s attention.</p>
<p>Some of Paul’s arguments reect earlier Christian tradition, and </p>
<p>some may have generated such tradition. For example, the polemic re-</p>
<p>garding true children of Abraham (4:11–17; cf. 9:6–13) reects a debate </p>
<p>already found in the early Palestinian gospel tradition (Matt 3:9/Luke </p>
<p>3:8; cf. John 8:39–41). Likewise, Paul’s treatment of faith and works (here </p>
<p>or more generally) seems to have been caricatured (either to exploit it </p>
<p>or to denigrate it; cf. 3:8), inviting a rejoinder to that caricature in Jas </p>
<p>2:18–24.</p>

<p>The Setting of the Church in Rome</p>
<p>Even letter-essays sometimes addressed the receiver’s situation or inter-</p>
<p>ests (e.g., the need for consolation), and other sorts of letters did so even </p>
<p>more regularly. Ancient orators and writers tried to be sensitive to the </p>
<p>settings they were addressing, and (contrary to what some scholars argue </p>
<p>in the case of Romans) Paul is no exception. Paul writes this letter from </p>
<p>Corinth (cf. Rom 16:1; Acts 20:2–3), a colony closely tied with Rome (e.g., </p>
<p>merchants regularly traveled between them). Given the list of people Paul </p>
<p>knew in Rome (see Rom 16:3–15), he was undoubtedly well-informed </p>
<p>about issues there. is does not mean that Paul lacks interest in larger </p>
<p>principles (he does in fact work from a larger argument that resembles </p>
<p>15. For the point-by-point, sequential comparison, see Dunn 1988: 1:197.</p>
