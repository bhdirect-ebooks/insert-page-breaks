<p>Romans 5:12–21</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>dicates explicitly in 5:15a).</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Paul’s use of paired antithesis drives home the</p>
<p>point more fully, stirringly building to a rhetorical crescendo (as is readily </p>
<p>evident if one reads the letter aloud, the way Paul expected believers in </p>
<p>Rome to hear it). Paul argues from lesser to greater (on the superiority of </p>
<p>the “second man,” see 1 Cor 15:45–47), a common Jewish argumentative </p>
<p>technique (qal vaomer)</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>but one also common throughout the ancient</p>
<p>world. Some patristic interpreters and many scholars today argue that </p>
<p>Paul personies Sin and Death, and personication was also a familiar </p>
<p>rhetorical technique.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>e six uses of paraptōma in 5:15–20 recall 4:25, and might recall </p>
<p>the transgression of Adam in Wis 10:1. e term also typically implies </p>
<p>violation of a particular standard, hence it may prevent the hearer from </p>
<p>losing sight of the recurring topic of violation of the law. e allusion </p>
<p>back to 4:25 is most explicit in 5:18, which also repeats dikaiōsis (the only </p>
<p>other use in the Pauline corpus or nt). is passage, then, continues to </p>
<p>esh out the meaning of the gospel summary in 4:24–25.</p>
<p>Emphasizing the superiority of Christ over Adam, Paul repeatedly </p>
<p>stresses “grace” and the “free gi” (eight times in 5:15–17, and twice in </p>
<p>5:20–21). Righteousness is not earned, but bestowed; those who are in </p>
<p>Christ should live righteousness, but because of God’s gi rather than in </p>
<p>order to achieve it. In contrast to death reigning through Adam’s trans-</p>
<p>gression, those who are in Christ will reign in life (5:17). is expression </p>
<p>may refer to the eschatological kingdom,</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>and in the context of Adam</p>
<p>might allude to regaining the role that he lost (cf. Gen 1:26–28; cf. the </p>
<p>restoration of the image in Rom 8:29). “Life” (contrasting with Adam’s </p>
<p>legacy of death) appears in 5:17, 18, and 21, as in much Jewish usage as </p>
<p>shorthand for the resurrected “life of the coming age” (see 2:7; 4:17; 5:10; </p>
<p>6:10, 22–23; 8:11, 13).</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>24. Some later rabbis also expected God’s benet to the world through the righteous </p>
<p>to exceed the multiplication of death through Adam (Sipra VDDeho. par. 12.65.2.4). For </p>
<p>rhetorical reasons, Paul includes a series of -ma terms in the Greek of 5:14–16, especially </p>
<p>5:16.</p>
<p>25. E.g., Longenecker 1975: 117.</p>
<p>26. For death personied, see e.g., Hos 13:14; Sir 41:1–2; 2 Bar. 21:23; Horace Sat. </p>
<p>2.1.58; on personication generally, see e.g., Rhet. Her. 4.53.66. On sin as a power, see </p>
<p>Gaventa 2004.</p>
<p>27. Cf. 4:13; Dan 7:22; 1QM 1.5; 12.16; Jub. 22:11–12.</p>
<p>28. Such life belonged properly to the righteous (1:17; 10:5), which here means those </p>
<p>made righteous in Christ.</p>
