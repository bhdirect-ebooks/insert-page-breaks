<p> In 15:11 he cites Ps 117:1.</p>

<p>Paul’s nal citation</p>
<p>of Isa 11:10 (in Rom 15:12) is particularly compelling; no one disputed </p>
<p>that this root of Jesse (the restored stump of David’s line) was messianic </p>
<p>(Isa 11:1–11; cf. Rom 1:3).</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>is messiah would bring salvation and the</p>
<p>knowledge of God to all nations (Isa 11:9–10; though he would remove </p>
<p>the wicked, 11:4), and would likewise precipitate the restoration of the </p>
<p>scattered Jewish people (Isa 11:11–16). Paul follows the common Greek </p>
<p>translation, in which the Gentiles will hope on him, which Paul undoubt-</p>
<p>edly understands salvically (cf. Rom 5:2–5; 1 Cor 15:19).</p>
<p>Paul concludes these texts with a prayer for them: as he has spoken </p>
<p>of Scripture providing hope (15:4) and Gentiles hoping in Christ (“will </p>
<p>hope” being the nal term in 15:12), he now invokes the God of hope </p>
<p>(15:13). Earlier in the letter he has established that the way of faith allows </p>
<p>Gentiles to be accepted alongside Jews. Now he speaks of joy and peace </p>
<p>in this way of believing (15:13). As Paul has already argued, it is not laws </p>
<p>but the Spirit that brings “joy and peace” (14:17), here available through </p>
<p>trust (like righteousness elsewhere in Romans, cf. 5:1); the Spirit also ul-</p>
<p>timately sustains hope (5:5; Gal 5:5). “Peace” is partly relational (with one </p>
<p>another, 12:18; 14:19).</p>
<p>Closing of Romans (15:14—16:27)</p>
<p>As in some other letters, Paul concludes with important closing business </p>
<p>(Rom 15:14–33; cf. 1 Cor 16:1–18) before turning to nal greetings (Rom </p>
<p>16:1–16, 21–23), exhortations (16:17–20), and praise (16:25–27).</p>
<p>Paul’s Missionary Program (15:14–33)</p>
<p>Having completed the body of his argument, Paul now turns to some-</p>
<p>thing more like a normal letter closing.</p>

<p>15:9) and “truth” (relevant to 15:8). Hays (1989: 71–72) notes that “mercy” also appears </p>
<p>in Ps 18:50, aer the verse cited in Rom 15:10.</p>
