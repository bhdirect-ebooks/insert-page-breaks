<p>Closing of Romans</p>
<p>185</p>
<p>Not all names require equal comment for this short volume. </p>
<p>Particularly signicant and dierent from some churches in the east is </p>
<p>the dominance of women explicitly involved in some forms of ministry </p>
<p>(16:1–7, 12).</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>is is not surprising, since women exercised much more</p>
<p>freedom in Rome (and in a Roman colony in Macedonia, Phil 4:2–3) than </p>
<p>in much of the Greek east. Although Paul greets over twice as many men </p>
<p>as women, he commends more women than men for ministry, perhaps </p>
<p>partly because even in Rome their ministries still faced more challenges </p>
<p>than men, hence invited more armation.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Paul begins with Prisca and Aquila (16:3–5), his close coworkers in </p>
<p>Corinth and Ephesus (1 Cor 16:19; Acts 18:1–2, 18, 26) who have now </p>
<p>returned to Rome. It was unusual for a wife to be named rst, as Prisca </p>
<p>(a Latin name that had a more familiar form, Priscilla) usually is by Paul </p>
<p>and Luke; this sequence signied either higher social status (as normally </p>
<p>in antiquity)</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>or higher status in the church (as possibly relevant in the</p>
<p>churches).</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Paul calls them his “fellow workers,” a title that, along with</p>
<p>diakonos (16:1), is among Paul’s most common designation for his col-</p>
<p>leagues in ministry (Rom 16:9, 16, 21; 2 Cor 8:23; Phil 2:25; 4:3; Col 4:11; </p>
<p>1 ess 3:2; Phlm 1, 24).</p>
<p>“Risking necks” was an idiom for risking lives (employing the image </p>
<p>of beheading, 16:4).</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Somehow they may have protected Paul, whether</p>
<p>in Corinth or (more oen proposed) Ephesus, so that those touched by </p>
<p>his Gentile mission owe gratitude to them. at the church meets in their </p>
<p>“house” (16:5) may simply mean that it meets in their dwelling; the vast </p>
<p>majority of dwellings in Rome itself were tenement apartments, the larger </p>
<p>homes being nearer the ground oor.</p>

<p>many of the patristic opinions in Bray 1998: 368–72.</p>

<p>18. ough husband-and-wife teams are well-known in business, possibly Aquila </p>
<p>now supervised more of the business and Prisca more of the house church ministry.</p>

<p>Deissmann 1978: 117–18. One being beheaded would “lay down” the neck (Seneca the </p>
<p>Elder Suas. 6.17; Seneca the Younger Nat. 2.59.7; Epictetus Disc. 1.1.18–25; cf. Tg. Neof. </p>
