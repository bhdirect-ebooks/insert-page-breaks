<p> Diaspora Jews followed the same approach of submis-</p>
<p>sion to traditional structures, oen to undermine Gentile suspicions of </p>
<p>their subversiveness.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Synagogues, like other associations in Rome, had</p>
<p>to remain apolitical or face dissolution;</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> the political relevance of a “mes-</p>
<p>sianic” claim may have led to the banning of Jewish believers from Rome </p>
<p>a few years earlier (Suetonius Claud. 25.4).</p>
<p>Paul clearly is concerned how others in Rome will view the church </p>
<p>there (12:17–18; cf. 14:16, 18; 15:2). If we grant an apologetic element in </p>
<p>Paul’s purpose, the question remains as to why he focuses on relations with </p>
<p>the state rather than other societal relationships. e local situation in </p>
<p>Rome may help answer that question. Probably less than a decade earlier, </p>
<p>the emperor had apparently punished a conict in the Jewish community </p>
<p>over the identity of the Messiah, a conict that had probably included </p>
<p>Jewish believers in Jesus.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> is could have le Jewish messianists’ reputa-</p>
<p>tion tenuous, inviting special attention to this issue. (It could also t the </p>
<p>warning not to seek their own revenge; see comment on 12:17–21.) at </p>
<p>Nero scapegoated and massacred Christians beginning less than a decade </p>
<p>(and perhaps just six years) aer Paul wrote this letter suggests that Paul’s </p>
<p>apologetic concern was a viable one.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Having established God’s sovereignty in history in chapters 9–11, </p>
<p>Paul now recognizes that God also appoints rulers for his purposes </p>
<p>(13:1–2, 4).</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> Paul elsewhere appeals to God’s sovereign plan when exhort-</p>
<p>ing believers to remain content (2 Cor 9:8; Phil 4:11) and to remain in </p>
<p>one’s situation (unless opportunity arises to change the situation, 1 Cor </p>
<p>7:21–24); this bears some resemblance to Stoic submission to fate, ex-</p>
<p>3. For 1 Pet 2:13—3:7, see Balch 1981; idem 1988; for the household codes in Eph </p>
<p>5:21—6:9, see Keener 1992: 139–224 (esp. 146–47).</p>

<p>pire, many “patriotically” xenophobic elements remained in the city itself.</p>
<p>8. It is also possible that the conict had involved some messianists’ actual retalia-</p>
<p>tion against synagogue opponents, hence Paul’s insistence on nonretaliation (12:17–19), </p>
<p>hoping that the state would punish perpetrators and not pure victims. While plausi-</p>
<p>ble, however, we lack sucient information to treat this proposal as more than mere </p>
<p>speculation.</p>
