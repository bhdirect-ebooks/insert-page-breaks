<p>Closing of Romans</p>

<p>ning with his own ministry; see 1 Cor 15:5–7; Gal 1:19; 1 ess 2:7 [with </p>
<p>1:1]). Detractors to Junia being an apostle note that Paul speaks twice of </p>
<p>apostles (commissioned agents) of churches; yet these are always speci-</p>
<p>ed as such (2 Cor 8:23; Phil 2:25). One cannot insist that Paul speaks </p>
<p>here merely of “agents of churches” as opposed to his normal sense of </p>
<p>“apostles,” since he oers no such specication here, unless one argues </p>
<p>on the basis that women could not be apostles (which would constitute a </p>
<p>circular argument here, assuming what it is designed to prove). e other </p>
<p>uses in Romans apply to himself (1:1; 11:13). We should keep in mind, </p>
<p>however, that Paul’s broader usage for an agent commissioned by Christ </p>
<p>does not specify, as people sometimes assume, “members of the Twelve” </p>
<p>or “writers of Scripture.”</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>It does seem to imply special authorization and</p>
<p>is normally accompanied by suering (1 Cor 4:9) and signs and wonders </p>
<p>(2 Cor 12:12).</p>
<p>Although Paul could employ “fellow prisoners” guratively,</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>he</p>
<p>later employs the language for those who were with him at least somehow </p>
<p>in his captivity (Col 4:10; Phlm 23); given Paul’s “many imprisonments” </p>
<p>(2 Cor 11:23), we cannot be sure where (in view of 1 Cor 15:32, perhaps </p>
<p>Ephesus?). at they were “in Christ” before Paul, however, suggests that </p>
<p>they belonged to the Jerusalem church. eir Greek (Andronicus) and </p>
<p>Latin (Junia) names suggest that they hailed from Diaspora families in </p>
<p>Jerusalem, possibly in Junia’s case descended from freed slaves of Roman </p>
<p>citizens (as Paul likely was; thus they may have attended the same “syna-</p>
<p>gogue of freedpersons” mentioned by Luke in Acts 6:9).</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>But while it</p>
<p>might therefore be tempting to envision Junia as Paul’s “relative” in a </p>
<p>closer sense, Paul uses the term “kin” (suggenēs) here for all fellow Jews </p>
<p>(Rom 9:3; 16:11, 21).</p>
<p>“Ampliatus” and “Urbanus” (16:8–9) were common slave names; if </p>
<p>Paul met them in the east, they are probably freedmen.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> Given the move-</p>
<p>ment’s birth in Rome’s Jewish community, many think that the “household </p>
<p>23. Given the culture, we also cannot be certain as to the sphere of ministry; per-</p>
<p>haps Andronicus and Junia each focused on ministry to their own gender (but cf. Acts </p>
<p>16:13–15; 18:26).</p>
<p>24. Cf. perhaps Phlm 23; gurative captivity in e.g., Pliny Ep. 2.8.2.</p>
<p>25. Alternatively, Bauckham (2002: 165–94) suggests that Junia was a Roman citizen </p>
<p>follower from Jesus’s Galilean ministry, namely Joanna, who likely remarried aer Chuza’s </p>
<p>death (Luke 8:3). On Junia as an apostle, see also e.g., Bruce 1990: 262; Epp 2005.</p>
<p>26. Urbanus’s Latin name probably suggests that he had been named by a Roman </p>
<p>citizen; on manumission he probably achieved citizenship.</p>
