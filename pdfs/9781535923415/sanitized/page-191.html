<p>not observe it. Perhaps for Paul the spirit of setting aside time for rest </p>
<p>and worship was the point behind the day, hence took precedence over </p>
<p>literal observance especially when, as just noted, literal observance was </p>
<p>impossible (cf. circumcision in 2:25–29, though this, like food customs, </p>
<p>was particular to Israel). For Paul, in any case, the issue is a secondary one </p>
and not a basis for dividing believers, and this is his primary point.
<p>20</p>
<p>Romans also had festivals</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> and regarded particular days as inauspi-</p>
<p>cious.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>But while the Roman world took o regular market days every</p>
<p>eight or nine days, they lacked a weekly Sabbath.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>e Sabbath was central</p>
<p>to Jewish practice throughout the ancient world.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Gentiles were widely</p>
<p>aware of the Jewish Sabbath,</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> and some Gentiles attracted to Judaism ap-</p>
<p>parently avoided pork and honored the Sabbath in symbolic ways, such as </p>
<p>lighting lamps.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Judaism was rife with debates about festival days, though</p>
<p>normally these conicts involved simply the correct date for observance </p>
<p>(especially stemming from dierences between the solar and lunar cal-</p>
<p>endars). Perhaps within two generations of Paul’s writing some of Jesus’s </p>
<p>followers were clashing with traditional Jews over fast days (Did. 8.1).</p>
<p>Whether regarding special worship days or food customs, the issue </p>
<p>is motivation: one should observe or not observe such customs “to the </p>
<p>Lord” (14:6).</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>For Paul, this issue simply reects the larger principle of</p>
<p>doing everything for the Lord. at principle, rather than an outward </p>
<p>regulation, is the real criterion for true religion (14:7–9). e “Lord” for </p>
<p>whom believers are to live and die (14:7–8) is Jesus, who died and rose </p>
<p>20. Cf. prophets who regarded Sabbath observance as meaningless without justice </p>
<p>(Isa 1:13; cf. Amos 8:5; Hos 2:11).</p>
