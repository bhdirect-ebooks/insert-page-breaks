<p>Romans 13:8–14</p>

<p>of the Lord” (1 ess 5:2), and the day as the time for being awake (Rom </p>
<p>13:11) and sober (13:13) was a commonplace Paul’s audience could have </p>
<p>understood (cf. 1 ess 5:5–7). Believers thus need to live in the light </p>
<p>of the eschatological reality they have already entered in Christ (Rom </p>
<p>12:2; cf. 2 Cor 5:5). Others used the image of awakening intellectually or </p>
<p>morally,</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>and being awake also contrasts with the spirit of stupor in 11:8</p>
<p>(Isa 29:10) and those darkened in 11:10.</p>
<p>Many connect the image of “putting o” and “putting on” with </p>
<p>waking from sleep in the morning; whatever was worn during the night, </p>
<p>certainly people did clothe themselves in the morning.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Although Paul’s</p>
<p>audience may think in terms of praetorian soldiers stationed just outside </p>
<p>Rome, the “armor of light” (Rom 13:12; cf. 1 ess 5:8; Eph 6:11–17) for </p>
<p>him might recall additionally a sectarian Jewish expectation of an end-</p>
<p>time battle between the children of light and the children of darkness </p>
<p>(1QM 1.1, 11; cf. 1 ess 5:5). Here, however, the exhortation is not to </p>
<p>ght but to stand guard, to watch; ancients regularly condemned guards </p>
<p>who would fall asleep or get drunk on duty.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Paul envisions not a literal physical battle but a </p>
<p>spiritual one;</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>staying alert here means avoiding the sorts of deeds done</p>
<p>in darkness, at night or in secret. Such deeds include drunkenness, sexual </p>
<p>immorality, and mistreatment of others (13:13; cf. Gal 5:21; 1 Pet 4:3).</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul has earlier warned of war with the passions (7:23) and condemned </p>
<p>the premeditated following of the esh and its lusts. Now he reiterates </p>
<p>the only solution: “putting on” the new person, Christ (13:14; cf. Rom </p>
<p>5:12—8:13). Christ, then, is their “armor of light” (13:12). Paul’s meta-</p>
<p>22. E.g., Valerius Maximus 7.2.3; Seneca Ep. Lucil. 20.13; Tacitus Hist. 3.55; Lucian </p>
<p>Hermot. 71, 83; Maximus of Tyre Or. 10.6; Marcus Aurelius Med. 6.31; in prophetic or </p>
<p>eschatological settings, Isa 51:17; 52:1; Joel 1:5; 1 En. 82:3; Rev 3:2; cf. the quotation in </p>
<p>Eph 5:14. It might also prepare for eschatological resurrection (Dan 12:2).</p>
<p>23. Cf. the conjunction of “awake” and “clothe” in Isa 52:1, which Paul would apply to </p>
<p>that eschatological time (cf. Isa 52:7 in Rom 10:15).</p>
<p>24. For gurative armor for rhetorical “battles,” see e.g., Horace Ep. 1.18.15–16; </p>
<p>Seneca the Elder Controv. 9, pref. 4; Fronto Eloq. 1.16; for moral or philosophic ones, </p>
<p>Seneca Ep. Lucil. 109.8; 117.7, 25; Ps.-Diogenes Ep. 19; Dio Chrysostom Or. 16.6; 49.10; </p>
<p>cf. Malherbe 1989: 101–5; 2 Cor 10:3–5. It is prayer in Wis 18:21.</p>
<p>25. Sexual immorality was sometimes available at drinking parties (e.g., Valerius </p>
<p>Maximus 4.3. ext. 3a; Quintus Curtius 5.7.2; Alciphron Courtesans 13, frg. 6), though the </p>
<p>warning here is doubtless broader, given “jealousy.”</p>
