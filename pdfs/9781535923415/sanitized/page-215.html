<p>Closing of Romans</p>

<p>unity. He sends greetings from the churches of the east (16:16) and will </p>
<p>oer more specic greetings in 16:21–23.</p>
<p>Beware Selsh Teachers (16:17–20)</p>
<p>Paul oers a nal, closing exhortation.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>While it is framed in general</p>
terms, its warning against those who cause division (dichostasia, “factious
<p>hostility”; 16:17) is relevant to the problems among believers in Rome </p>
<p>(see particularly 14:1—15:7), especially since these schismatics also cause </p>
<p>“stumbling” (16:17; cf. 14:4, 13, 21). Paul also earlier held as a standard </p>
<p>the teaching they had received (including the gospel, 6:17); this message </p>
<p>oered the criterion for evaluating other teachings.</p>
<p>at such contentious persons who hurt others’ faith were “slaves </p>
<p>not of Christ but of their own bellies” (16:18) recalls Paul’s earlier teaching </p>
<p>about being slaves of God rather than sin (6:6, 16–22; 7:6; 12:11; 14:18) </p>
<p>and comments on passions and desires (1:24, 26; 6:12; 7:5, 7–8; 13:14). </p>
<p>It might also hint at those reluctant to forgo foods for the sake of others’ </p>
<p>faith (14:21), but need not be construed so narrowly; moralists regularly </p>
<p>mentioned “bellies” (originally as a metonymy for gluttony) for self-in-</p>
<p>dulgence (also in 1 Cor 6:13; Phil 3:19).</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>Because Paul has not mentioned</p>
<p>“opponents” elsewhere in this letter (despite 3:8), he might warn about a </p>
<p>potential external threat (cf. Phil 3:2), or he might envision the possibility </p>
<p>of some current leaders being corrupted (cf. Acts 20:29–30). ough sen-</p>
<p>sitive to build rapport, Paul disclaimed attery (1 ess 2:5); his rhyming </p>
<p>“ne” and “blessing” speech (chrēstologia, eulogia) warns against those </p>
<p>who would merely encourage and pander to hearers’ desires (cf. 2 Tim </p>
<p>4:3; 2 Pet 2:1–3, 10–14). Especially if it is connected with the following </p>
<p>context (16:20), Paul’s mention of deception in 16:18 might echo the kill-</p>
<p>ing role of sin exploiting the law in 7:11 (which some see as an echo of </p>
<p>how the devil destroyed Adam; cf. Gen 3:13).</p>
<p>31. A minority of scholars treat the paragraph as an interpolation, because it inter-</p>
<p>rupts greetings; but textual evidence is against this proposal, and Paul’s letters are full of </p>
<p>digressions. Paul may break up the greetings sections deliberately with this reminder; </p>
<p>closing exhortations (e.g., Fronto Ad M. Caes. 3.16.2) and summaries were common </p>
<p>toward a work’s conclusion. Some material could follow a closing summary (e.g., Isaeus </p>
<p>Cleon. 48 with 49–51).</p>
<p>32. E.g., 3 Macc 7:11; Philo Spec. Laws 1.148, 192, 281; 4.91; further sources in Keener </p>
<p>1999: 342; hence “slave of the belly” in Maximus of Tyre Or. 25.6; Achilles Tatius Leuc. </p>
<p>Clit. 2.23.1; Philostratus Vit. Apoll. 1.7 (cf. also Sallust Bell. Cat. 2.8).</p>
