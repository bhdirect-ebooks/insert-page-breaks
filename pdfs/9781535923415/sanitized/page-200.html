<p>Romans 15:14–33</p>

<p>demand otherwise, speakers and writers liked to build rapport with their </p>
<p>audience, assuring them of condence in them.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Paul thus assures the</p>
<p>believers in Rome that he does not assume that they need all his exhorta-</p>
<p>tions; he is simply reminding them of values that he trusts they already </p>
<p>know and share (15:14–15).</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>ey were “full” of goodness and had been</p>
<p>“lled” with knowledge (both in contrast to the wicked of 1:29). ey thus </p>
<p>would be able to admonish one another on their own (Rom 15:14; cf. 1 </p>
<p>ess 5:14; contrast 1 Cor 4:14).</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If Paul has written “boldly,” it is not because he thinks ill of them </p>
<p>but because God has given him special grace to impart to them in this </p>
<p>way (15:15; cf. 1:11–12).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>He had earlier spoken through “the grace given</p>
<p>to me” in calling them to humble cooperation (12:3), “grace given” rep-</p>
<p>resenting a ministry giing from God (12:6). God has graced Paul in a </p>
<p>special way as a minister to Gentiles (1:13; 11:13), hence his ministry to </p>
<p>them, both by this letter now and eventually in person (15:24, 28–29). </p>
<p>In particular, God has called him to oer the good news as a priest </p>
<p>(hierourgeō), so he might oer the Gentiles as a “pleasing oering” to God, </p>
<p>consecrated by the Holy Spirit (15:16). By reminding Gentiles to remain </p>
<p>in unity with their Jewish siblings, hence their sacred “root” (11:16), Paul </p>
<p>seeks to fulll his (guratively) priestly oce.</p>

<p>His words recall his earlier</p>
<p>159; Talbert 2002: 327; Harvey 1998: 138; Jewett 2007: 902). For the “apostolic parousia” </p>
<p>structure here, see Funk 1967: 251–53; this ts letters’ interest in announcing the writer’s </p>
<p>coming.</p>
<p>13. See Olson 1985; Stowers 1986: 128–30; in antiquity, John Chrysostom Hom. Rom. </p>
<p>29; Ambrosiaster. Such expressions of condence were also common before requests (cf. </p>
<p>15:24–28; see Olson 1985: 286).</p>
<p>14. See e.g., epistolary “reminders” in Cicero Fam. 13.75.1; Pliny Ep. 8.24.1, 10; </p>
<p>in other exhortation, e.g., Isocrates Demon. 21; Cicero Font. 13.28; idem Amic. 22.85; </p>
<p>Epictetus Disc. 4.4.29; 4.13.23; dierent sources in Aune 1987: 191.</p>
<p>15. A role usually assigned to teachers and elders (e.g., Iamblichus Pyth. Life 22.101; </p>
<p>33.231), but among Epicureans shared by all (Jewett 2007: 904–5; cf. Malherbe 1986: </p>
<p>48). Notably, Paul assigns the role to all members, not to the “strong” (Jewett 2007: 905). </p>
<p>For “letters of admonition,” see Stowers 1986: 125–32. “All knowledge” is conventional </p>
<p>hyperbole (e.g., Let. Aris. 139, 239) in contrast to the ideal Stoic (which involves idealiza-</p>
<p>tion; e.g., Arius Didymus Epit. 2.7.11m, p. 94.5).</p>
<p>16. Admitting that he has spoken “boldly” may reect the rhetorical technique of </p>
<p>parrēsia (cf. Anderson 2000: 94).</p>
<p>17. We should not read into this depiction later sacerdotal functions borrowed from </p>
<p>Gentile civic religion, though Paul probably applies the image to gospel ministry (cf. </p>
<p>1 Cor 9:13) in a manner somewhat dierent from the “priesthood of believers” more </p>
<p>generally (Rom 12:1; also the evocation of Exod 19:6 in 1 Pet 2:9; Rev 1:6; 5:10).</p>
