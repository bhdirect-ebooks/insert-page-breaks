<p>Romans 12:9–21</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>rhetorically: three clauses in 12:10–11 end with -oi, and seven successive </p>
<p>clauses in 12:11–13 conclude with plural participles ending in -ontes or </p>
<p>-ountes.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Scholars debate whether Paul in 12:11 speaks of being fervent</p>
<p>“in spirit” or “in the Spirit” (cf. Acts 18:25). Because “spirit” in Romans </p>
<p>usually refers to God’s Spirit (sometimes even when linked with disposi-</p>
<p>tions or abstract nouns, 8:2, 15), I think it is more likely God’s Spirit here. </p>
<p>“Serving” the Lord recalls Paul’s earlier emphasis on slavery to God (cf. </p>
<p>6:22; 7:6; 14:18). In 12:12, “rejoicing in hope” and “enduring in aiction” </p>
<p>recall especially 5:2–5. Paul has modeled “persevering in prayer” (12:12) </p>
<p>in his prayers to see them (1:10), and will seek them to keep praying for </p>
<p>him (15:30).</p>
<p>In 12:13, “sharing with the needs of the saints” prepares for Paul’s </p>
<p>mention of his misson to provide for the needy saints in Jerusalem (15:25–</p>
<p>27).</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>e term translated “hospitality,” one of the highest of ancient social</p>
<p>values, meant providing for strangers, oen by taking them in.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>(As such</p>
<p>a practice could be dangerous even in antiquity, Jewish travelers oen </p>
<p>carried letters of recommendation.) At least one case of such provision </p>
<p>may be for Paul when he visits (15:24, 28).</p>
<p>In a culture that emphasized honor and shame, blessing those who </p>
<p>cursed you might not come naturally. Although many ancient think-</p>
<p>ers valued nonretaliation and avoiding revenge (12:14, 17, 19–21),</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> </p>
<p>the wording of 12:14 could reect Jesus’s teachings (Luke 6:28; cf. Matt </p>
<p>5:44).</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Perhaps Paul’s focus on nonretaliation and blessing those who</p>
<p>curse addresses a local issue (not impossibly related to the Jewish conict </p>
<p>over messiahship and consequent expulsion from Rome, reported in a </p>
<p>20. Paul also connects 12:13 and 12:14 with the same verb diōkō, though using it in </p>
<p>two dierent senses (“pursue” and “persecute”).</p>
<p>21. Employing some of the same vocabulary; although koinōneō could involve “shar-</p>
<p>ing” more generally, early Christians oen employed it in an economic way (also Gal 6:6; </p>
<p>Phil 4:15).</p>

<p>Jos. Asen. 23:9; 29:3; b. Ber. 17a; Shab. 88b, bar.; Flusser 1988: 485, 506. But some limited </p>
<p>this to their own community (cf. Sipra Qed. pq. 4.200.3.6; Stendahl 1962) and valued </p>
<p>vengeance (e.g., Jdt 9:2; 1 Macc 2:67; T. Levi 5:3).</p>

<p>Ladd 1974: 514; Kim 2002: 264–69; Wenham 1984: 15–17. Even so, epistolary genre did </p>
<p>not lend itself to many direct citations (Stuhlmacher 1991: 16–19; Gerhardsson 1991), </p>
<p>and the textual nature of Scripture aorded simpler quotation material.</p>
