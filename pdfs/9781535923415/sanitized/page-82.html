<p>Romans 3:9–20</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>Scholars today debate the precise sense of “works of the law” in 3:20. </p>
<p>Some argue that it indicates specically Jewish identity markers such as </p>
<p>circumcision (cf. chs. 4, 14), while others contend that the phrase should </p>
<p>include obedience to all the law unless specied otherwise. (e precise </p>
<p>sense of the parallel phrase in the Qumran text 4QMMT is similarly de-</p>
<p>bated; cf. 1QS 6.18.) Given biblical texts about “doing” the law, “works” </p>
<p>of the law presumably may encompass the whole.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Jewish</p>
<p>distinctives would emphasize Paul’s case particularly well, as his point </p>
<p>here is to emphasize that the written law does not make Jewish people </p>
<p>more righteous before God than Gentiles (3:9, 22–23, 29–30). It is also </p>
<p>such distinctives that Gentiles joining Israel in the traditional way would </p>
<p>be most compelled to adopt (as exemplied in the emphasis on circumci-</p>
<p>sion in Gal 2:3–12; 5:2–11; 6:12–15), advantages Jews inherited as part of </p>
<p>their culture.</p>
<p>God’s Solution for All (3:21–31)</p>
<p>Humanity has sinned and merited judgment (3:9–20), but God remains </p>
<p>faithful and righteous (3:21–31; cf. 3:1–8), so that people can also be </p>
<p>set right with him through faith. e law revealed sin but did not make </p>
<p>people righteous (3:20). We should not take this limitation to mean that </p>
<p>the law itself is bad (7:7, 14). e problem is not the law, but using it in </p>
<p>a way that it was never intended to be used. e law teaches right from </p>
<p>wrong but does not provide, nor does it claim to provide, self-justication </p>
<p>by one’s own religious achievement. e law and the prophets do in fact </p>
<p>teach the right way to be put in right relationship with God and made </p>
<p>righteous (3:21): not by boasting in one’s achievement, but by faith, i.e., </p>
<p>depending on God (3:27, 31). Paul will go on to specify that at this stage </p>
<p>in salvation history the faith must be in God’s ultimate work, Jesus the </p>
<p>Messiah (3:26).</p>
<p>Paul has been addressing God’s righteousness to some degree since </p>
<p>the key statement in 1:17, where God’s righteousness was also “revealed” </p>
<p>(despite the dierent term) in terms of faith.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>His development of the</p>
<p>concept will, however, cluster here (3:22, 25, 26); repetition was a stan-</p>
<p>21. Cf. Gathercole 2002: 92–93, 238; Watson 2007: 19, 128, 212.</p>
<p>22. Paul’s likely conclusion suggests that Gentiles’ salvation is an important part of </p>
<p>God’s righteousness now revealed from Scripture (16:26), inverting traditional expecta-</p>
<p>tions of what his righteousness involved (3:3–5).</p>
