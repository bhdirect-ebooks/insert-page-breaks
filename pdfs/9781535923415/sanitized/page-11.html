<p>Preface</p>
<p>Romans is well-served with strong academic commentaries, but sparser </p>
<p>on the end of concise, academically informed commentaries for a general </p>
<p>audience. I hope that this brief commentary will contribute to that niche. I </p>
<p>trust that readers will recognize that I could not cover every point in a com-</p>
<p>mentary this size. I have covered what I could, but retain research notes to </p>
<p>produce a much larger commentary on Romans if time permits. I am grate-</p>
<p>ful to my co-editor for allowing me more space than some shorter volumes </p>
<p>in the series, so that I did not need to end my comments, like some early </p>
<p>manuscripts of Romans, with chapter 14 (or at least to omit the cover).</p>
<p>I have included only a fraction of my research documentation in the </p>
<p>notes for interested readers to follow up, endeavouring at the same time </p>
<p>to avoid distracting readers who choose such a volume for its concise-</p>
<p>ness.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Less technical readers should not feel intimidated by the footnotes,</p>
<p>but should simply feel free to ignore them. Use of footnotes allowed me </p>
<p>to keep the main text more readable, focused on the points that seemed </p>
<p>most central to Paul’s case.</p>
<p>To keep the series balanced, the editors’ rst two choices for a </p>
<p>Romans commentator oered perspectives and backgrounds dierent </p>
<p>from mine; I have oered mine here only because our rst choices’ other </p>
<p>commitments precluded their participation. I am grateful to E. P. Sanders </p>
<p>for conversation in the fall of 2008 about my understanding of the rheto-</p>
<p>ric of Paul’s argument, and editorial feedback from my Palmer colleague </p>
<p>Julia Pizzuto-Pomaco regarding Romans 16. anks to Chris Spinks </p>
<p>and Heather Carraher at Wipf and Stock. Special thanks go to Michael </p>
<p>Bird, my co-editor for the series, hence the only objective editor for this </p>
<p>volume. Michael is the series’ original designer, but having invited my </p>
<p>participation, negotiated very exibly both with respect to the series as </p>
<p>a whole and with regard to my own volume (while reminding me of the </p>
<p>series constraints where necessary).</p>
<p>1. Because I treated the background for some topics in Romans in greater de-</p>
<p>tail in other works, I refer readers there at appropriate points to conserve space here. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, readers will nd many of my primary references new to Romans research.</p>
