<p>Romans 2:25–29</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>e genuine Jew, Paul says, seeks his or her praise from God (2:29), </p>
<p>like the righteous people of 2:7, 10. Paul might be oering a wordplay </p>
<p>that some of his audience would recognize: the name of the Jews’ ancestor </p>
<p>“Judah” meant “praise” (though translated dierently in Gen 29:35; 49:8). </p>
<p>For the contrast between Spirit and letter, see the comment on 7:6.</p>
