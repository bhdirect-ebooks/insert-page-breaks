<p>Romans 1:18–23</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>us, humanity “knew” God, but because they refused to “glorify” </p>
<p>him (1:21),</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>they ended up exchanging his “glory” and image for that of</p>
<p>mortal, earthly creations (1:23). ey were God’s image (Gen 1:26–27), </p>
<p>but by corrupting God’s image in worshiping things other than God they </p>
<p>gave up and lost his glory (cf. Rom 3:23).</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>God punished their failure</p>
<p>to act according to the truth by delivering them to their moral insan-</p>
<p>ity (1:21–22).</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>Jewish people considered idolatry the climax of human</p>
<p>evil.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>Even Greeks, whose deities looked human, disdained the Egyptian</p>
<p>animal images also mentioned here.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>Sexual Sin (1:24–27)</p>
<p>Paul has narrated that humanity exchanged the truth about God for </p>
<p>idolatry (1:19–23), which he here calls a “lie,” the opposite of truth (1:25). </p>
<p>A direct consequence of this behavior was that God handed them over to </p>
<p>dele their own bodies sexually (1:24), including in same-sex intercourse, </p>
<p>which was “against nature” (1:26–27), i.e., (for a Jew) against the way God </p>
<p>created things to be. In the primeval era of the “creation” (Rom 1:20), God </p>
<p>revealed his character and made humanity in his image (Gen 1:26–27); </p>
<p>yet they distorted God’s image by worshiping other images (Rom 1:23).</p>
<p>83</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Exchanging God’s truth for lie involved idolatry (1:23, 25), but also a per-</p>
<p>version of right sexuality in God’s image to distorted sexuality (1:24, 26).</p>
<p>78. For humanity abandoning gratitude toward God, see also Josephus Ant. 1.72. </p>
<p>Ingratitude was among the most despised vices in Mediterranean antiquity (e.g., </p>
<p>Xenophon Cyr. 1.2.6; Mem. 2.2.2–3; Cicero Att. 8.4; Heraclitus Hom. Prob. 4.4; Seneca </p>
<p>Ben. 1.10.4; Ep. 81.1; ’Abot R. Nat. 46, §128 B).</p>
<p>79. Useful for Paul’s audience, Greeks and Romans also believed that humanity had </p>
<p>declined from a primeval golden age (Hesiod Op. 110–201; Ovid Metam. 1.89–312), but </p>
<p>Paul’s biblical allusions and polemic against idolatry infuse his narrative with the Jewish </p>
<p>subtext of Genesis (without claiming detailed allusions to Adam’s fall here, as some do). </p>
<p>e glory and image are restored in Christ (Rom 8:29–30).</p>
<p>80. e term mataios (“vain,” “futile”) in 1:21 was sometimes associated with idols </p>
<p>(e.g., Acts 14:15; 1 Kgs 16:26 lxx; Jer 8:19; 10:3, 15; Ezek 8:10; Wis 13:1; Sib. Or. 3.29, </p>
<p>547–48, 555), though the language here echoes Ps 94:11.</p>
<p>81. E.g., Wis 14:27; t. Bek. 3:12; Mek. Pisha 5.40–41; Sipre Deut. 43.4.1; 54.3.2. Later </p>
<p>rabbis said it was the nal stage to which the evil impulse would lead one.</p>
<p>82. E.g., Lucian Imag. 11; Philostratus Vit. Apoll. 6.18–19; Let. Aris. 138; Josephus Ag. </p>
<p>Ap. 2.81, 128, 224.</p>
<p>83. “Beginning” included the entire primeval period, including the rst people (e.g., </p>
<p>Mark 10:6; L.A.B. 1:1).</p>
