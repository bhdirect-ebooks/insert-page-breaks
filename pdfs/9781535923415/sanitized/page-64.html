<p>Fusing the Horizons: Homosexual Activity</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>Views Regarding Homosexual Behavior in Antiquity</p>
<p>Some Gentiles criticized homosexual behavior, for various reasons. Some </p>
<p>criticized it out of personal preference; some Romans considered it unmanly </p>
<p>or un-Roman.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>Many Roman philosophers associated the pursuit of boys</p>
<p>with excesses like gluttony and drunkenness. Some also criticized it as being </p>
<p>against nature (a point we will address more thoroughly, given its relevance </p>
<p>in 1:26–27).</p>
<p>More often, people regarded it as a personal preference or a common </p>
<p>practice. Some even defended it as being preferable to heterosexual affection, </p>
<p>which was said to be driven by animal passion rather than philosophic appre-</p>
<p>ciation. Anal intercourse was common enough that men also used it at times </p>
<p>with women (perhaps prostitutes), as attested on some of the many ancient </p>
<p>vase paintings that would today be classiﬁed as pornographic.</p>
<p>Jewish people, however, unanimously rejected homosexual behavior. </p>
<p>Some Diaspora Jews in contact with Greek culture considered it against na-</p>
<p>ture.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> Contrary to what some have argued, Jewish people included homo-</p>
<p>sexual behavior among Sodom’s sins. Most characteristically, Jewish people </p>
<p>associated homosexual activity especially (and probably largely accurately) </p>
<p>with Gentiles. Although Jewish sources report Jewish adulterers, johns, and </p>
<p>murderers, Jewish homosexual practice was nearly unknown.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>The obvious</p>
<p>contrast with ancient Greek culture suggests the prominent role played by </p>
<p>socialization in sexual formation.</p>
<p>Interpreting Paul</p>
<p>Could Paul have envisioned the issue of gay marriage? This is not likely. Some </p>
<p>time after Paul wrote Romans, it is reported that the young emperor Nero </p>
<p>“married” both a boy (whom he had castrated) and another man (Suetonius </p>
<p>Nero 28.1; 29; Tacitus Ann. 15.37). Even the reporters, however, offer these </p>
<p>95. Still, it could be better than being accused of adultery with a free matron (Valerius </p>
<p>Maximus 8.1. acquittals 12).</p>
<p>96. Philo Abraham 135–37; Spec. Laws 3.37–39; Josephus Ag. Ap. 2.273–75; Ps.-Phoc. </p>
<p>190–92; T. Naph. 3:4–5; cf. the later recension of 2 En. 10:4. More generally, Lev 18:22; </p>
<p>20:13; Josephus Ag. Ap. 2.199, 215; idem Ant. 3.275; Ps.-Phoc. 3; Sib. Or. 3.764; 4.34; </p>
<p>5.166, 387, 430.</p>
<p>97. On homosexual behavior as a Gentile sin, see e.g., Let. Aris. 152; Sib. Or. 3.185–86, </p>
<p>596–600; Tg. Ps.-J. on Gen 39:1. Later rabbis disclaimed even suspecting this behavior </p>
<p>for Israelites (y. Qidd. 4:11, §6).</p>
