<p>Romans 11</p>
<p>Israel’s Role and Salvation (9:1—11:36), cont.</p>
<p>A Remnant (11:1–10)</p>
<p>Paul has spent much of Romans establishing that God welcomes Gentile </p>
<p>believers as equal members alongside Jewish believers without them </p>
<p>having to observe the law in the traditional Jewish way. Here, however, </p>
<p>he begins to urge Gentile believers (11:13) more explicitly to respect the </p>
<p>Jewish people; he will soon warn them not to despise Jewish customs for </p>
<p>which Gentiles in Rome oen despised them (ch. 14).</p>
While God’s covenant with Israel did not save individual Jewish per-
<p>sons who did not maintain the covenant (ultimately through obeying the </p>
<p>prophet-king God had provided),</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>it did guarantee a special favor toward</p>
<p>this people in other respects (cf. 3:2; 9:4–5). Moreover, God retained a </p>
<p>plan for the Jewish people as a whole. (Indeed, various Gentile observers </p>
<p>through history have viewed the survival of the Jewish people as a clear </p>
mark of divine providence.)
<p>If Israel has rebelled against their own salvation (10:3, 16–21), has </p>
<p>God therefore rejected them (11:1)?</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Paul is adamant that God has not;</p>
<p>his own faith as a Jewish believer is itself a testimony that God has le a </p>
<p>remnant (11:1).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>God foreknew both the present disobedience and the</p>
<p>1. Most Jews would have agreed with this premise based on Scripture; yet many also </p>
<p>held that Israel as a whole would be saved, minus a minority of apostates (see comment </p>
<p>on Rom 11:26).</p>
<p>2. e verb for “casting o” in 11:1–2 applies to Israel in the common Greek transla-</p>
<p>tion (e.g., Judg 6:13; Pss 44:9, 23; 60:1, 10; 74:1; 108:11), including with the title of “God’s </p>
<p>people” as here (1 Sam 12:22; Ps 94:14; on connections with the latter’s context, see Hays </p>
<p>1989: 69–70). By exile, he did (temporarily) cast them o (2 Kgs 17:20; 21:14; 23:27; Jer </p>
<p>7:29; Hos 4:6; 9:17).</p>
<p>3. Aer treating Israel’s failure to embrace God’s way of righteousness (9:30—10:21), </p>
<p>Paul returns to the “remnant” theme raised in 9:27–29 (Tobin 2004: 340; Anderson </p>
<p>1999: 235). For views concerning the biblical “remnant,” see e.g., Davies 1980: 77–79; </p>
