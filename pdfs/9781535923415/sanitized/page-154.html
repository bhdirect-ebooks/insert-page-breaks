<p>Romans 10:11–21</p>

<p>and “salvation” are also synonymous in the day of judgment): “Whoever </p>
calls on the [divine] Lord’s name will be saved” (10:13; Joel 2:32). By “all”
<p>or “whoever” (pas) in both verses, Paul argues that the same Lord (Jesus, </p>
<p>10:9–10) is over all, both Jew and Gentile, who call on him (10:12). (is </p>
<p>is also how he used “no distinction” in 3:22; cf. Col 3:11; Acts 15:9.)</p>
<p>In 10:14–17 Paul recognizes that to call on Jesus presupposed access </p>
<p>to the gospel message (the “word of faith,” 10:8). Paul develops another </p>
<p>rhetorical chain in 10:14–15,</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>concluding with a conrmation in 10:15</p>
<p>from Isa 52:7, which refers to the “good news” of “salvation” and God’s </p>
<p>reign, when God graciously restores his people.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>us access to the gospel message is needed for salvation; yet Israel’s </p>
<p>problem, Paul now argues, is not ignorance, but disobedience (10:16, </p>
<p>18–21). Having quoted Isa 52:7, Paul now skips just a little ahead in the </p>
<p>same context (as even synagogue readers were allowed to do). From the </p>
<p>beginning of a passage about the suering servant, Paul reminds his audi-</p>
<p>ence that Israel itself did not embrace this good news about their restora-</p>
<p>tion (Isa 53:1). is passage belongs to a section (52:13—53:12) that early </p>
<p>Christians regularly applied to Jesus’s mission (see comment on Rom </p>
<p>4:24–25). Salvic faith is available through hearing the “report” about </p>
<p>Christ (10:17), but Scripture warned that Israel would reject this very </p>
<p>report about Christ (10:16). Far from Jewish unbelief posing a credibility </p>
<p>problem for Paul’s Jewish message, it simply fullled what the prophets </p>
<p>had predicted.</p>
<p>Paul demonstrates Israel’s moral accountability (i.e., they are guilty </p>
<p>of rejection, not just less culpable ignorance) in 10:18–21. e interlocu-</p>
<p>tor insists in 10:18–19 that perhaps Israel has never heard (hence should </p>
<p>not be held so accountable), repeating the objection in dierent words </p>
<p>so that Paul can respond with two dierent arguments from Scripture. </p>
<p>e rst, in 10:18, cites Ps 19:4, which might allude back to the testi-</p>
<p>mony of creation available to even Gentiles in Rom 1:19–20.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Or perhaps</p>
<p>Paul appeals to the biblical revelation about Christ; the context in Psalm </p>
<p>19 seems to link the message about God pervasive in creation (19:1–6) </p>
<p>9. See Anderson 1999: 237; idem 2000: 57–58; and comment on 5:3–4.</p>
<p>10. e runners’ feet probably were mostly exposed (hence would have scrapes and </p>
<p>mud from their mission), and other ancient sources comment on the beauty of feet. </p>
<p>e idea here, however, is probably a metonymy (cf. Rhet. Her. 4.32.43), hence a way of </p>
<p>praising the message they bring.</p>
<p>11. Cf. e.g., Ps.-Heraclitus Ep. 4; 3 En. 46:3; and comment at 1:19–20.</p>
