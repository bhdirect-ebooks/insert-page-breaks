<p>Romans 1:1–7</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Paul probably returns to this crucial point in 16:26. Disobedience brings </p>
<p>reproach on Christ (cf. 2:24); God saves a people for his “name,” that is, </p>
<p>for his glory or honor.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>(Roman society had a keen sense of honor and</p>
<p>shame, and would appreciate the importance of God’s honor.)</p>
<p>“Saints” (in some translations of 1:7) means “those who have been </p>
<p>set apart” (cf. 1:1). Scripture portrayed Israel as “beloved” (cf. 11:28), </p>
<p>“called” (cf. 11:29), and as “set apart” for God (cf. 11:16).</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Paul readily</p>
<p>applies all these titles to a majority Gentile congregation (cf. 1:13), since </p>
<p>all who serve Israel’s rightful king (1:3–4) are graed into Israel’s heritage </p>
<p>(cf. 11:16–17). ey, too, are special objects of God’s love (5:5, 8; 8:35, </p>
<p>39; and probably 15:30).</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>It was customary to build rapport with one’s</p>
<p>audience toward the beginning of one’s work, when possible,</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>and clearly</p>
<p>Paul shares this sensitivity.</p>
<p>Signicantly, in 1:7 Paul adapts the conventional greeting of his day </p>
<p>(as elsewhere in his and some other early Christian letters). Greek greet-</p>
<p>ings were normally simply chairein (“greetings”);</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Paul and some other</p>
early Christian writers adapt this to charis (“grace”; divine “generosity”)
<p>and include the typical Judean (and Eastern) greeting “peace” (reect-</p>
<p>ing Hebrew shalom, which is analogous to the contemporary English </p>
<p>greeting “God bless you”).</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Paul’s major adaptation, however, is more</p>
<p>signicant. Letters typically included prayers or wishes invoking dei-</p>
<p>ties on behalf of the recipients’ health or welfare. Paul here blesses the </p>
<p>believers by invoking not only God the Father, but also the Lord Jesus </p>
<p>Christ. Although post-Nicene readers might suppose that Paul envisions </p>
<p>17. Schreiner (1998: 23, 35–36) rightly emphasizes the centrality of God’s glory and </p>
<p>honor in this letter. See e.g., Rom 1:21, 23; 2:24; 3:23; 4:20; 9:17, 23; 11:36; 14:6; 15:6–9.</p>
<p>18. Although the churches in Rome may not have been more unied at this time </p>
<p>than Rome’s synagogues were, we should not read much into Paul’s lack of mention of </p>
<p>“church” here (in contrast to Jewett 2007: 61; cf. Rom 16:5), any more than we should, </p>
<p>say, in Phil 1:1.</p>
<p>19. Also of Paul’s (12:19; cf. 16:5, 8, 9, 12).</p>
<p>20. E.g., Rhet. Alex. 29, 1436b.17–40; Cicero Inv. 1.15.20; idem De or. 1.31.143; idem </p>
<p>Fam. 13.66.1; Statius Silvae 2.preface; Quintilian Inst. 4.1.5.</p>
<p>21. E.g., Demosthenes Epitaph. 1.1; Chariton Chaer. 4.5.8; 8.4.5; Josephus Life 365–</p>
<p>66; Acts 15:23; Jas 1:1; Deissmann 1978: 150–204 passim; Kim 1972: 10–20, esp. 11.</p>
<p>22. Jewish letters in Greek sometimes combined chairein with “peace” (2 Macc 1:1); </p>
<p>a Hebrew letter could combine “mercy” and “peace” in a greeting (2 Bar. 78:2–3). Paul is </p>
<p>not the only early Christian writer to combine “grace” and “peace” (1 Pet 1:2; 2 Pet 1:2; 2 </p>
<p>John 3; Rev 1:4; 1 Clem. title; cf. Ign. Smyrn. 12.2).</p>
