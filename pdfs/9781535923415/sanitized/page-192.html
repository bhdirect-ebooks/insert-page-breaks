<p>Romans 14:1–12</p>
<p>166</p>
<p>as Lord (14:9). (Cf. the emphasis on sharing his death and new life in </p>
<p>6:2–11; on Jesus as risen Lord cf. also 10:9–10.)</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>Because all would stand before God’s judgment seat (14:10), judging </p>
others now was both pointless and dangerous, usurping a divine preroga-
<p>tive and inviting stricter judgment (2:1–3).</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>(Residents of Rome were</p>
<p>familiar with a bēma or judgment seat, corresponding to the rostrum in </p>
<p>the Roman forum.) Verifying the need for “all” (Jew and Gentile) to stand </p>
<p>before God (14:10, 12), Paul cites Isa 45:23: “every” knee and tongue </p>
<p>would acknowledge God at the judgment (Rom 14:11).</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>(e context</p>
<p>in Isaiah, 45:21–24, emphasizes that God is the only savior and source of </p>
<p>righteousness, even for the Gentiles.)</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>Do Not Risk Siblings Stumbling (14:13–23)</p>
<p>Rather than “judging” others, Paul admonishes (playing on senses of </p>
<p>“judge,” cf. 14:10), one should “judge” not to provoke a fellow believer to </p>
<p>fall away from faith (14:13). Food is a secondary matter not worth risking </p>
<p>anyone’s salvation over (14:13, 15). For Paul, foods are neutral, neither </p>
<p>clean nor unclean (14:14; Paul is speaking ritually, according to Lev 11, </p>
<p>not equating all food hygienically or nutritionally).</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>e issue is how one</p>
<p>views the food (14:14), because one must eat “to the Lord” (14:6; cf. 1 </p>
<p>Cor 10:31). To risk grieving or even “destroying”</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>another believer over</p>
<p>food is to fail to walk in love (14:15), hence to violate the true heart of the </p>
<p>28. For “whether we live or die,” cf. 2 Macc 6:26.</p>
<p>29. On judgment before God’s throne (on the analogy with royal thrones), cf. e.g., 1 </p>
<p>En. 47:3; 90:20; 4 Ezra 7:33; by the elect one, 1 En. 55:4; 61:8; 62:3; 69:27–29 (all from the </p>
<p>Similitudes, of uncertain date).</p>
<p>30. at Paul can apply this text directly to Jesus elsewhere (Phil 2:11), as well as </p>
<p>the image of the “judgment seat” (2 Cor 5:10), shows just how closely he connected the </p>
<p>Father and Son.</p>
<p>31. Because God swears by himself in Isa 45:23, Paul summarizes with the common </p>
<p>ot “As I live” (e.g., Deut 32:40, a context cited in 15:10; esp. prominent in Ezek; in Isaiah, </p>
<p>see 49:18), equivalent to other swearers’ “As YHWH lives.”</p>
<p>32. Many nd here a reference to the tradition in Mark 7:15 (e.g., Jeremias 1964: 14; </p>
<p>Dunn 1998: 685; Kim 2002: 264–65); this may well be the case, but we should note that </p>
<p>the application to foods is ambiguous without Mark’s explanation (Mark 7:19).</p>
<p>33. A common Pauline term that can suggest eternal destruction (2:12; 1 Cor </p>
<p>1:18–19; 2 Cor 2:15; 4:3); the closest parallel here, suggesting that Paul preached such </p>
<p>material more than once, is 1 Cor 8:11. is ts the sense of “stumble” in 14:13; cf. John </p>
<p>Chrysostom Hom. Rom. 26.</p>
