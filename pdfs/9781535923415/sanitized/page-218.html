<p>Romans 16:21–23</p>
<p>192</p>
<p>to translate the Latin title aedile.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>Alternatively, aedile may have been a</p>
<p>subsequent oce that Erastus held. Candidates for the oce of aedile had </p>
<p>to be wealthy, since they oered pledges of the funds they would provide </p>
<p>the city if elected.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>Since Paul grants no Christian title, possibly Erastus</p>
<p>was simply a patron for the Christian community rather than a member </p>
<p>(like the Asiarchs in Acts 19:31).</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>e Erastus of Acts 19:22 is clearly a</p>
<p>believer, but a Corinthian political gure probably would not be free to </p>
<p>travel with Paul (though cf. 2 Tim 4:20).</p>
<p>Praising God’s Wisdom (16:25–27)</p>
<p>Paul has been concluding his letter in stages (greetings to Rome, a clos-</p>
<p>ing exhortation, greetings from Corinth), and now oers a nal praise to </p>
<p>God (cf. 1:25; 9:5; esp. 11:33–36). Some manuscripts relocate this closing </p>
<p>doxology to aer 14:23 or elsewhere (or include it in both locations), and </p>
<p>a few omit it (though most early manuscripts have it here, and the wid-</p>
<p>est geographic range also supports its inclusion).</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>e passage provides</p>
<p>such a tting conclusion for Romans, however, it seems likelier designed </p>
<p>by Paul than by a typical scribe.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>As 15:14–33 repeats many themes of</p>
<p>1:8–15, so 16:25–27 recalls earlier material, especially 1:2–5 (the most </p>
<p>important echo being the “obedience of faith”).</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>As 11:33–36 praised</p>
<p>God for his wisdom in designing history (11:1–32), so here Paul again </p>
<p>praises the “only wise God,” the designer of history.</p>
<p>41. Winter 1994: 185–87; Erastus was not a common name in Corinth (cf. Winter </p>
<p>1994: 180, 191–92). A city manager could even be a public slave, though oen a tempo-</p>
<p>rary one merely for the duration of the activity.</p>
<p>42. Winter 1994: 182–83. Erastus apparently promised to pave a street (Winter 1994: </p>
<p>184).</p>
<p>43. See Keener 2006.</p>
<p>44. Some manuscripts of Romans ended with 14:23, probably (as we noted earlier) </p>
<p>due to Marcion’s predilections; if Marcion omitted most of chs. 15–16 but retained the </p>
<p>closing words, this might explain the tradition of this location preserved in some mss. </p>
<p>See textual discussion in Metzger 1975: 533–36, 540.</p>
<p>45. With many, e.g., Marshall 1999: 183; Stuhlmacher 1994: 256; Grieb 2002: 146. </p>
<p>Jewett (2007: 998), himself viewing it as inauthentic, opines that scholars are fairly evenly </p>
divided on the question. As Schlatter (1995: 278) observes, the letter probably did not
<p>end with the greeting to Quartus.</p>
<p>46. Conclusions oen summarized elements of a work (e.g., Rhet. Alex. 36, 1443b.15–</p>
<p>16; Aeschines Tim. 196; Cicero Fin. 5.32.95–96; Dionysius of Halicarnassus uc. 55; </p>
<p>idem Dem. 32; Musonius Rufus 3, p. 42.23–29).</p>
