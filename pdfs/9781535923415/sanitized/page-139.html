<p>Life in Christ and the Spirit</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>Having noted concrete aictions like hunger and martyrdom, Paul </p>
<p>turns now more generally to the powers and the cosmic dimension of </p>
<p>the suering. Because “rulers” (archai) and “powers” (dunameis) occur </p>
<p>in the context of angels and other superhuman powers, many scholars </p>
<p>believe that Paul refers here to heavenly ranks of spiritual authorities that </p>
<p>stand behind the earthly ones.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>Some have taken “height” and “depth” to</p>
<p>refer to astrological</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>or, more simply, astronomical terms; in any case,</p>
<p>the antithesis functions together as a Hebraic merism for all creation </p>
<p>(Isa 7:11)—the greatest extremes could not separate God’s presence (Ps </p>
<p>139:7–12, especially 139:8). Paul’s climactic obstacle is “anything else </p>
<p>created”—a reminder that if everything other than God is God’s creation </p>
<p>(Rom 1:20, 25) and if God is for his people, nothing can be against them. </p>
<p>Indeed, creation itself longs for and will celebrate the deliverance of God’s </p>
<p>people (8:19–22).</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Suffering</p>
<p>Paul’s theological approach to suffering would encourage his Roman audi-</p>
<p>ence. They had faced the trauma of many of their number being expelled </p>
<p>(49 CE), a situation that had ended perhaps less than ﬁve years earlier (54 </p>
<p>CE), and would soon face deadly persecution (c. 64 CE). These believers also </p>
<p>shared broader human experiences like grief for loved ones.</p>
<p>Suffering recalls our attention to God’s faithfulness and promises. </p>
<p>Believers in many parts of the world experience suffering on a dramatic level. </p>
<p>Many have faced deadly persecution, such as (among many other possible </p>
<p>examples) in northern Nigeria, Iran, and the Indian state of Orissa. Others </p>
<p>have suffered from genocide and horriﬁc ethnic conﬂicts, such as in the </p>
<p>eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Even in the face of such intense suf-</p>
<p>fering, though, believers have often learned to cling deeply to God for hope </p>
<p>(cf. 5:3–5). My wife was for eighteen months a refugee during war in Congo-</p>
<p>Brazzaville, and her journal records her experiences of hope in God that gave </p>
<p>her strength to face the anguish.</p>
