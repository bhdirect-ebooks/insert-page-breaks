<p>Romans 8</p>
<p>Life in Christ and the Spirit (5:12—8:39), cont.</p>
<p>Living by the Spirit (8:1–17)</p>
<p>In 8:1–15 Paul contrasts the new life in Christ with the best that law-</p>
<p>informed esh could do in 7:7–25. As 7:7–25 reected life under law in </p>
<p>the esh introduced in 7:5, so 8:1–17 reects the new life of the Spirit </p>
<p>introduced in 7:6. Paul paints this contrast graphically, in the binary </p>
terms standard in his culture. us, for example, Jewish wisdom divided
<p>humanity into the righteous and the wicked, the wise and the foolish; </p>
likewise, Stoic philosophers divided humanity into those who were
<p>perfectly wise and those who were foolish.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Yet all Jews recognized that</p>
<p>most or all people sinned (see comment on 3:9), and even “advanced” </p>
<p>Stoic philosophers recognized that they did not perfectly conform to the </p>
<p>ideal wise person.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>In other words, Paul uses the familiar imagery of ideal</p>
<p>types.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> e issue is not that a person of the Spirit might sometimes suc-</p>
<p>cumb to eshly temptation. Rather, the issue is that a person either had </p>
<p>God’s Spirit in them, hence lived a life oriented toward God, or a person </p>
<p>had nothing more than themselves to depend on, hence could live only </p>
<p>according to the esh.</p>
<p>Whereas the person in bondage to sin in 7:15–25 recognizes that </p>
<p>the law is good and thus that the person stands justly condemned for sin, </p>
<p>1. E.g., Seneca Dial. 7.11.1; Arius Didymus Epit. 2.7.11i, p. 78.12–18. is Stoic ideal-</p>
<p>ization occasioned criticism (e.g., Cicero Fin. 4.24.66–68; Lucian Hermot. 76–77). Stoics, </p>
<p>however, spoke of life according to nature or wisdom, not according to the eschatological </p>
<p>Spirit.</p>
<p>2. E.g., Seneca Ep. Lucil. 87.4–5; idem Dial. 7.18.1; Erskine 1990: 74; Engberg-</p>
<p>Pedersen 2000: 61–62, 72–73; cf. similarly Confucius Analects 14.30.</p>
3. See Keener 2008a: 211, 213–15 (also noting the same division in Qumran, 214; cf.
<p>Flusser 1988: 64–65; additionally new life in CD 16.4–6). One might speak even of two </p>
<p>races of humanity (see e.g., Arius Didymus Epit. 2.7.11g, p. 72.5–18; Philo Alleg. Interp. </p>
<p>2.4).</p>
