<p>Living the Christian Life</p>

<p>garbled way in Suetonius Claud. 25.4). e value of sharing others’ joys </p>
<p>and sorrows was common</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>(though rather than weeping with mourners,</p>
<p>philosophers, in contrast to Paul here, oen advocated not weeping); the </p>
<p>most typical examples were weddings and funerals. Paul probably echoes </p>
<p>a Jewish tradition about mourning with those who mourn (Sir 7:34–35), </p>
<p>and the practice would certainly encourage unity.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>In 12:16 Paul reinforces warnings against wrong thinking that </p>
<p>leads to disunity, twice using “think” (phroneō) and once phronimos; in </p>
<p>other words, appropriate perspectives are crucial (cf. 8:5–7). “inking </p>
<p>the same” (nrsv “live in harmony with one another”) recalls the sound </p>
<p>thinking that does not exalt oneself (12:2–3). e call to harmony that the </p>
<p>phrase entails was a frequent ancient topic (including in the form of “be-</p>
<p>ing of one mind”),</p>
<p>27</p>
and is particularly relevant for this ethnically divided
<p>congregation (cf. 14:1—15:13, esp. 15:6; 16:17; cf. 1 Cor 1:10–12; Phil </p>
<p>2:1–3). Whatever else Paul’s warning against conceit in 12:16 includes, it </p>
<p>includes the corporate sense of superiority expressed by either Gentiles </p>
<p>looking down on Jews (11:20) or the reverse, presumably as well as boast-</p>
<p>ing in one’s own gis (12:3). “Associating with the lowly” again challenges </p>
<p>ancient society’s emphasis on honor, but follows the way of Jesus (cf. e.g., </p>
<p>Mark 9:35–37; 10:42–45). Not counting oneself “wise” contrasts with </p>
<p>those who became fools by this means (Rom 1:22), perhaps including the </p>
<p>Greeks’ belief in their own ethnic superiority (1:14), and certainly Gentile </p>
<p>disdain Jews (11:25, with similar wording).</p>
<p>As noted above, nonretaliation (12:17–20) appears in other ancient </p>
<p>sources. Its unanimity in early Christian sources,</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>however, is striking</p>
<p>and suggests a common background in Jesus, whose submissive death </p>
<p>dependent on God set the example for his early followers. Being consid-</p>
<p>erate toward outsiders’ views of what was right (12:17) oers another ele-</p>
<p>25. E.g., Tob 7:7–8; Josephus Ag. Ap. 2.205; T. Jos. 17:7; cf. friendship in Dio </p>
<p>Chrysostom Or. 1.30–31; Fronto De nepote amisso 2.7; Marshall 1987: 46. In another </p>
<p>culture, cf. the example of Confucius (Analects 7.9; 9.9; 10.16).</p>
<p>26. Perhaps Gentile believers did not mourn when Jewish believers were expelled; </p>
<p>but the practice would now build unity whatever the previous local particulars.</p>
<p>27. Cf. e.g., Xenophon Mem. 4.4.16; Lysias Or. 2.24, §192; Cicero Phil. <span class="_ _5" />6.1.2; <span class="_ _5" />Dionysiu<span class="_ _0" />s </p>
