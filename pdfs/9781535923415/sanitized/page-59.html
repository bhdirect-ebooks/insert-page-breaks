thinkers by Paul’s day ultimately believed in one divine designer behind
<p>everything (including the other gods).</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>us, aer arguing for the necessity of a cause,</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> the late rst-cen-</p>
<p>tury Stoic philosopher Epictetus argues from the structure of objects that </p>
<p>they reect a designer and not mere chance:</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>“Assuredly from the very</p>
<p>structure of all made objects we are accustomed to prove that the work </p>
<p>is certainly the product of some articer, and has not been constructed </p>
<p>at random.”</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>Anyone who observes the facts of nature, yet denies the</p>
<p>existence of a creator, he opines, is stupid.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>Epictetus believed that human</p>
<p>beings, and especially their intellect, most complex of all, particularly </p>
<p>revealed the designer.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> Many others (including Cicero and Seneca) con-</p>
<p>curred: humans,</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> and especially their intellect,</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>were inexplicable apart</p>
<p>from design. Jewish thinkers in the Greek world had adapted such ideas </p>
<p>for a purer monotheism centuries before Paul,</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>making his missionary</p>
<p>job much easier.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>Jewish intellectuals like Paul, however, believed that</p>
<p>such reasonings simply conrmed what was obvious in Genesis.</p>

<p>Some earlier Stoics tended toward pantheism, but Stoicism generally distinguished </p>
<p>between matter and the logical principle (the logos) which organized matter (I explore </p>
<p>some of these ideas further in Keener 2003b: 341–47).</p>

<p>75. E.g., Cicero Nat. d. 2.59.147—61.153; Porphyry Marc. 26.410–11. ey viewed </p>
<p>knowledge of a deity as innate in people (Seneca Ep. Lucil. 117.6; Dio Chrysostom Or. </p>
<p>12.27–28; Iamblichus Myst. 1.3). Some also adduced in favor of deities’ existence the </p>
<p>universal pervasiveness of belief in them (Cicero Tusc. 1.13.30; cf. Maximus of Tyre Or. </p>
<p>11.5).</p>
<p>76. For example, the Jewish philosopher Philo borrows various philosophers’ argu-</p>
<p>ments for God’s existence (Wolfson 1968: vol. 2, 73–93), including Plato’s argument from </p>
<p>creation (p. 74) and material from Stoic sources (pp. 75–83).</p>
<p>77. He may especially draw on the Wisdom of Solomon, a widely circulated Jewish </p>
<p>work in Greek (cf. Wis 13:1–9, including “without excuse” in 13:8); there the conse-</p>
<p>quences of idolatry culminate in a vice list (Wis 14:12–31). Cf. also Jewish stories about </p>
<p>Abram reasoning back to a rst cause and resisting idolatry. For subsequent Christian </p>
<p>approaches to “natural theology” here, see concisely Bray 1998: 34, 37–38; Reasoner </p>
