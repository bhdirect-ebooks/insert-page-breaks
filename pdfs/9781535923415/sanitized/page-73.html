<p>Made Right by Trusting Christ</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>noxious to begin with,</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>but for Paul boasting in one’s works as opposed</p>
<p>to God’s activity is sinful (3:27; 4:2; 5:2–3, 11; 15:17).</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Ancient rhetoric was fond of repetition, which cumulatively reinforces </p>
<p>the overall eect of one’s words. Paul cites about eleven pious Jewish claims </p>
<p>for his interlocutor in 2:17–20, whose righteousness he then challenges </p>
<p>with ve rhetorical questions (as oen in prosecuting or defensive rheto-</p>
<p>ric) in 2:21–23.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>e latter cases each use antithesis and the literary device</p>
<p>of starting and ending with parallel language (x . . . y/x . . . y) to drive home </p>
<p>the point. Evoking prophetic biblical critiques throughout,</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Paul nishes</p>
<p>o the hyperbolic hypocrite with an explicit text in 2:23–24. Ironically, the </p>
<p>righteousness this interlocutor claims in the law of Moses is available only </p>
<p>to those in whose hearts the law is written by the Spirit (8:2–4):</p>
<p>e name “Jew” (2:17) True Jews (2:29), children of Abraham </p>
<p>(4:12, 16–17), and those graed into Israel </p>
<p>(11:17)</p>
<p>Boasting in God (2:17, 23) Boasting in God the right way (5:11; cf. </p>
<p>5:2–3)</p>
<p>Knowing God’s will and </p>
<p>approving the good (2:18)</p>
<p>Knowing God’s will and approving the </p>
<p>good (12:2)</p>
<p>A light to those in darkness </p>
<p>(2:19)</p>
<p>People of light rather than darkness </p>
<p>(13:12)</p>
<p>Teacher of law (2:20) Right use of teaching (6:17; 12:7; 15:4; </p>
<p>16:17)</p>
<p>Having knowledge and truth </p>
<p>in the law (2:20)</p>
<p>Having knowledge of truth (15:8, 14)</p>
<p>17. See discussion in Forbes 1986; Watson 2003; Keener 2005b: 221–22.</p>
<p>18. On boasting here, cf. Gathercole 2002: 162–88, 215. Given possible allusions to </p>
<p>Isa 42:6–7 here, it is not impossible that this Jewish “instructor” is also seeking to reach </p>
<p>(and circumcise) Gentiles (cf. Isa 42:6; those in darkness in Rom 1:21), not unlike the </p>
<p>teacher in Josephus Ant. 18.82. But this leader of the blind was himself blind and in </p>
<p>darkness (cf. Rom 11:8–10).</p>
<p>19. Cf. analogous challenges to hypocrisy in antiquity, e.g., Seneca Controv. 2.6.5; and </p>
<p>many other cases of accumulating rhetorical questions, e.g., Lysias Or. 10.22–23, §118; </p>
<p>Cicero Phil. 3.6.15; Musonius Rufus 11, p. 80.22–25; 13B, p. 90.13–16; 15, p. 98.25–27; </p>
<p>Lucian Tyr. 10. ese add rhetorical force (see Dionysius of Halicarnassus Dem. 54).</p>
<p>20. See e.g., Jer 7:9; Grieb 2002: 32; cf. 1QS 1.23–24; CD 4.16–18; 8.5–8.</p>
