<p>Romans 14:1–12</p>
<p>162</p>
<p>Scholars sometimes demur from a Jewish focus in Romans 14 because </p>
<p>Jews were not restricted to “vegetables” (14:2) or avoiding wine (14:21). </p>
<p>But this may be simply Paul’s hyperbole, given factors supporting a </p>
<p>Jewish focus. It is soon clear that Paul is addressing the issue of Jews and </p>
<p>Gentiles accepting one another (15:7–12); issues of law predominate </p>
<p>in Romans, and “clean” and “unclean” foods do refer to Jewish kashrut </p>
<p>(14:14).</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Nevertheless, whether or not the vegetarianism is hyperbole,</p>
<p>it is grounded in reality: when other kosher food was unavailable for </p>
<p>whatever reason, Jews might resort to gs and nuts (Josephus Life 13–14), </p>
<p>food in the wild (2 Macc 5:27), or vegetables more generally (Josephus </p>
<p>Ant. 10.190).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> It is doubtful that the problem is the lack of kosher butch-</p>
<p>ers, which would have undoubtedly existed in Rome (even if much of </p>
<p>the Jewish community had been expelled, enough members would have </p>
<p>now returned to demand some such accommodations).</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Most people in</p>
<p>antiquity probably could not aord meat very oen, except in connection </p>
<p>with pagan cults;</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>abstaining from such cults (as Paul would expect all</p>
<p>believers to do, 1 Cor 10:19–21) could also curtail available meat (see </p>
<p>discussions of 1 Cor 8–10).</p>
<p>Some Jewish people debated among themselves whether there was </p>
<p>a higher moral signicance to the laws, and what that signicance was.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Philo kept the food laws literally but found in them allegorical signicance </p>
<p>that led to higher moral behavior,</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>and he was not the rst Alexandrian</p>
<p>9. Most commentators do recognize Jewish kashrut here; see especially Barclay 2001: </p>
<p>289–93; earlier, see some ancient commentators like Ambrosiaster and eodoret (in </p>
<p>Bray 1998: 337–38). Jewett (2007: 837) regards “vegetables” as the strong’s stereotype.</p>
<p>10. Some scholars note that one might avoid Gentile wine from which libations had </p>
<p>been poured (m. Abod. Zar. 2:3–4; 3:8—5:11; probably Dan 1:12; Jdt 12:1–2), though </p>
<p>some could also avoid wine as a (voluntary, not expected) partial fast to God (Dan 10:3; </p>
<p>T. Reu. 1:10; T. Jos. 3:5; some cite also T. Jud. 15:4, but cf. 14:6; 16:3–5).</p>
<p>11. Cf. the later Roman butcher in Williams 2002. Rome accommodated Jewish cus-</p>
<p>toms even in their various enclaves (Winter 2001: 288–93).</p>
<p>12. So most scholars, though the case is debated (see the concerns of Meggitt 1994; </p>
<p>information in Frost 1999).</p>
<p>13. Cf. e.g., Sipre Deut. 75.2.1. Cf. the private view attributed to Paul’s contemporary </p>
<p>Yohanan ben Zakkai (but reported much later) in Daube 1956: 142; Flusser 1988: 38 </p>
<p>(surprisingly similar to Mark 7:14–23).</p>
<p>14. See Spec. Laws 4.100–118; Rhodes 2003; Sanders 1990: 273. Philo had a problem </p>
<p>with extreme allegorizers (Migration 89–93; Hay, “Extremism”). Pigs were thought un-</p>
<p>able to control sexual appetites (Xenophon Mem. 1.2.30).</p>
