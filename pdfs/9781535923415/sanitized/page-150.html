<p>Romans 10</p>
<p>Israel’s Role and Salvation (9:1—11:36), cont.</p>
<p>Two Approaches to the Law and Righteousness </p>
<p>(9:30—10:10), cont.</p>
<p>As Paul lamented Israel’s failure in 9:1–3, so he emphasizes his desire for </p>
<p>their salvation in 10:1. He has already noted their failure to be saved be-</p>
<p>cause of their failure to depend on the rock, approaching the law wrongly </p>
<p>as a matter of observance rather than trust in God (9:31–33).</p>
<p>When Paul testies of Israel’s “zeal” yet laments that its object is mis-</p>
<p>informed (10:2), he has experience with this misinformed zeal (Gal 1:14; </p>
<p>Phil 3:6). He contends that they seek righteousness by their means rather </p>
<p>than God’s (10:3); God’s own righteousness includes his saving character </p>
<p>that would put them right (see comment on 1:17). eir failure to “submit </p>
<p>themselves” to God’s righteousness (10:3) was to be expected insofar as </p>
<p>they were not depending on God’s superhuman power; mere esh cannot </p>
<p>submit to God’s law from the heart (8:7). ey could not achieve righ-</p>
<p>teousness by works to fulll the law any more than any law code makes </p>
<p>its non-transgressors truly righteous before God; only in Christ (5:17, 21) </p>
<p>and by the Spirit (8:2–4) are people made righteous.</p>
<p>us, Paul argues, Christ is the “end” (telos) of the law for righteous-</p>
<p>ness from the standpoint of faith. e Greek term for “end” can involve </p>
<p>either “goal” or “termination.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“Goal” seems the likelier primary nuance,</p>
<p>but the context (which denes the sense in which the law ends or climaxes) </p>
<p>1. A similar interpretive crux appears in 2 Cor 3:13; in both, Paul might think in </p>
<p>terms of eras of salvation history, in which case the Mosaic form of law prepared for </p>
<p>the current end-time era (Gal 3:24–25). Origen, Erasmus and Calvin preferred “comple-</p>
<p>tion” rather than “termination” (Reasoner 2005: 113, 117). For “end,” see e.g., Dunn, </p>
<p>Käsemann, Rhyne, Sanday and Headlam, Schreiner, Stuhlmacher, Talbert, Watson; for </p>
<p>“goal,” e.g., R. D. Anderson, Craneld, Donaldson, D. Fuller, Haacker, Hays, G. Howard, </p>
<p>Jewett, Johnson.</p>
