<p>Romans 8:18–30</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>as the people God had chosen,</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>and recognize that Paul’s argument was</p>
<p>designed to show that God was so sovereign that he was not bound to </p>
<p>choose (with regard to salvation) based on Jewish ethnicity. Paul might </p>
<p>ground predestination in foreknowledge (8:29) to allow that God takes </p>
<p>faith into account (in advance) in salvation (a question much debated by </p>
<p>theologians). Whether or not this is the case, he apparently refers to God’s </p>
<p>choice mostly to emphasize the initiative of God’s grace rather than hu-</p>
<p>man works (9:11). Perhaps more importantly, Paul will use even the term </p>
<p>“foreknow” for Israel (11:2),</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>thus connecting this claim with his larger</p>
<p>argument. e specic formulation of Paul’s discussion of God choosing </p>
<p>people is still driven by his overall plan in Romans to argue that God </p>
<p>saves Gentiles as well as Jews through Christ (see comment on 1:16).</p>
<p>In 8:30 Paul uses rhetorical climax (cf. 5:3–4) to point to the certain-</p>
<p>ty of sharing Christ’s glory based on what God has already accomplished. </p>
<p>Paul presents all the elements in 8:30 as a fait accompli,</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>since from the</p>
<p>standpoint of God’s foreknowledge it is already done, though from the </p>
<p>human standpoint glorication in particular remains clearly future (8:18, </p>
<p>21).</p>
<p>Secure in God’s Love (8:31–39)</p>
<p>Before illustrating his point about God’s gracious choice (8:29–30) from </p>
<p>history (9:6–13), Paul in a rousing way gives the implications of his previ-</p>
<p>ous discussion. e present suerings cannot be compared with future </p>
<p>glory (8:18), and none of these suerings can separate believers from </p>
<p>God’s love (8:35–39). Paul generates emotion in this passage with rousing </p>
<p>rhetorical questions (8:31–35), aiction lists (8:35, 38–39), and a con-</p>
<p>spicuous chiasm (an inverted parallel structure, 8:35–39).</p>
<p>46. See e.g., Neh 9:7; Jer 33:24; Sir 46:1; 2 Macc 1:25; Jub. 1:29; 22:9–10; 2 Bar. 48:20. </p>
is should not be taken to exclude individual predestination (emphasized, e.g., in
<p>Qumran; for the righteous remnant, cf. 1QS 1.10; 2.5; 9.14; 11.7; 1QM 10.9–10; 12.1, 4; </p>
15.1–2; 17.7), though most Jewish people did not treat the human and sovereign divine
<p>elements as mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>47. In Romans (cf. also Jub. 15:30); the terminology could also be applied more </p>
<p>widely (1 En. 9:11).</p>
<p>48. Perhaps something like the completed action implied in the so-called “prophetic </p>
<p>perfect” in Hebrew prophecy (e.g., Isa 53:4–6), although Hebrew tenses do not match </p>
<p>English temporal tenses.</p>
