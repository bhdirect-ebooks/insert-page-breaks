<p>8</p>
<p>keep the law as a natural part of their culture regardless of the question </p>
<p>of salvation. By contrast, for Gentiles to keep it as a condition for belong-</p>
<p>ing to the covenant, and still more (on some particularly strict views) </p>
<p>for salvation,</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>was to demand new “works” as a condition for inclusion</p>
<p>rather than simply a sign of inner transformation. (One might compare </p>
<p>Western missionaries one or two centuries ago obligating new believers </p>
<p>in some parts of the world to adopt Western names and dress to conrm </p>
<p>their conversion to Christianity.) Although ethnically distinctive markers </p>
<p>in the law are not the only ones Paul addresses (his language is too broad </p>
<p>for that), these are the features that provoked the most complaint in Rome </p>
<p>and that seem a central problem in the practical relation of Roman believ-</p>
<p>ers addressed in Romans 14.</p>
<p>For Paul, to insist on maintaining literally all the distinctives man-</p>
<p>dated specically for ancient Israel was to ignore the climax of salvation </p>
<p>history, what God had accomplished in Christ. He treated outward cir-</p>
<p>cumcision as secondary to the spiritual covenant commitment it signi-</p>
<p>ed, and insisted that the new covenant in the heart obviated the details </p>
<p>of the earlier covenant that merely prepared the way for it. From Paul’s </p>
<p>perspective, this was simply following his own biblical Jewish faith to its </p>
<p>logical conclusion, in light of the coming of Christ and the Spirit. Many </p>
<p>of his contemporaries understandably disagreed, and their debates (albeit </p>
<p>usually from the Pauline side) surface repeatedly in the nt texts.</p>
<p>Paul, Judaism, and Rhetoric</p>
<p>Our problems reconciling what we know of ancient Judaism with Paul’s </p>
arguments stem not only from the diversity of ancient Judaism but from
<p>our unfamiliarity with ancient rhetoric. Polemic regularly caricatured </p>
<p>opponents, sometimes using hyperbole to reduce their position to the </p>
<p>absurd (see e.g., Matt 23:24). An ancient audience could recognize and </p>
<p>appreciate such strategies (except when recycling the language polemi-</p>
<p>cally themselves).</p>
<p>Most scholars today recognize that Paul sometimes employs ad </p>
<p>hoc arguments (e.g., in 1 Cor 11:3–16).</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Some such arguments appear</p>
<p>in Romans, where, for example, his caricature of a distinctly unreliable </p>
<p>13. In Galatia, Paul’s opponents possibly meant merely the former; if so, Paul prefers </p>
<p>a rigorous consistency that identies membership in the covenant with salvation.</p>
<p>14. See discussion in Keener 1992: 19–69; additional background in idem 2000a.</p>
