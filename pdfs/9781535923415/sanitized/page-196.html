<p>Romans 15</p>
<p>Living the Christian Life (12:1—15:13), cont.</p>
<p>Jewish and Gentile Believers Must Welcome One Another </p>
<p>(15:1–13)</p>
<p>Paul concludes his exhortation from 14:1–23 by calling believers not just </p>
<p>to tolerate but also to serve one another’s interests (to “please” one an-</p>
<p>other, 15:1–3).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Just as those who are physically strong would be expected</p>
<p>to help</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>weaker family members, Paul reminds those apt to criticize the</p>
<p>“weak” that they should be helping them instead (15:1). Echoing the </p>
<p>context, the “weak” refer to those weak in faith hence abstaining from </p>
<p>particular foods lest they injure their relationship with God (14:1–2).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul ranks himself among the “strong” here, and will soon oer himself </p>
<p>as an example of serving the poor saints in Jerusalem (15:25–27). “Build </p>
<p>up” in 15:2 evokes 14:19–20, where believers should build up (by the fruit </p>
<p>of the Spirit) rather than tear down one another over foods.</p>
<p>“Pleasing” others rather than oneself (15:1–3) refers not to enter-</p>
<p>taining every whim, but to being considerate of what might cause them </p>
<p>1. Some early manuscripts omit Rom 15–16, probably due to Marcionite inuence; </p>
<p>yet Paul does not complete the thought of 14:1–23 until 15:7 at the earliest.</p>
<p>2. “Bearing burdens” (cf. Gal 6:2, 5) might possibly remind this exhortation’s largely </p>
<p>Gentile hearers that Israel “bore” them (Rom 11:18). For the ideal of the stronger protect-</p>
<p>ing the weaker, see e.g., 1 ess 5:14; Mitchell 1991: 127; Stoics in Cicero Fin. 3.20.66; </p>
<p>Seneca Ep. Lucil. 90.5; for the greater protecting and ruling the lesser, Dio Chrysostom </p>
<p>Or. 3.62; for the “weak” as those dependent on rules, Seneca Ep. Lucil. 94.50. For the </p>
<p>terms regarding social strength, see Dio Chrysostom Or. 38.31; Mitchell 1991: 126–27; </p>
<p>for philosophers’ self-view, see Arius Didymus Epit. 2.7.11g, p. 72.18.</p>
<p>3. Paul employed this designation with regard to abstainers from idol food in 1 Cor </p>
<p>8:7–12. His language in that passage seems to have been borrowed from the “strong”; he </p>
<p>certainly did not approve of eating food oered to idols (see Keener 2005b: 73, 87–88; </p>
<p>Garland 2003a; idem 2003b: 365–66, 395). “Strong” is presumably the group’s self-des-</p>
<p>ignation here as well.</p>
