<p>Romans 7</p>
<p>Life in Christ and the Spirit (5:12—8:39), cont.</p>
<p>Freed from Law (7:1–6)</p>
<p>Paul has been addressing believers being freed from enslavement to sin </p>
<p>(6:12–23), and now addresses their liberation from the law (7:1–6).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ough Paul by no means equates sin and the law (7:7), he views the </p>
<p>latter as an instrument that magnied the responsibility for, hence power </p>
<p>of, the former.</p>
<p>He begins by comparing the believer to a widowed wife. He grants </p>
<p>that the law rules a person so long as one lives (7:1), but is building on </p>
<p>the case that believers have died (6:2–11).</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> e husband’s death “frees”</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>the wife from the “law” of her husband (7:2–3). Some Jewish traditions </p>
<p>portray the Torah as God’s daughter, Israel’s bride;</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Paul may shi such an</p>
<p>image slightly here to accommodate believers’ union with Christ (cf. 2 Cor </p>
<p>11:2). It is not believers’ husband that has died, but believers themselves </p>
<p>have died (Rom 6:2–11), hence are no longer married to the law. ey </p>
<p>died with Christ, and as his body (cf. Rom 12:4–5) are his bride. Although </p>
<p>spelled out explicitly only in Eph 5:28–31, Paul probably already inferred </p>
<p>the identity of bride and body from Gen 2:24, where husband and wife </p>
<p>1. Paul employs katargeō (to abolish or render ineective) in both sections (6:6; 7:2, </p>
<p>6; cf. 2 Cor 3:7–14), as well as cognates of eleutheros (6:18, 20, 22; 7:3).</p>
<p>2. Many comment that later rabbis viewed death as annulling the law’s jurisdiction.</p>
3. Language used both for widowhood (cf. 1 Cor 7:39) and divorce (cf. 1 Cor 7:15;
<p>m. Git. 9:3; CPJ 2:10–12, §144) in ancient Jewish sources, though Paul is interested only </p>
in the former analogy here. ose who try to prohibit divorce from this passage mis-
<p>appropriate Paul’s general language; the law (the point in question here) explicitly did </p>
accept divorce (Deut 24:1–4). at Greek-speaking husbands typically ruled their wives
<p>in antiquity (see Keener 2000d: 687–91) also allows for the idea of the law’s domination </p>
<p>here, since it might be taken for granted; nevertheless, analogies were limited in what </p>
<p>should be pressed from them.</p>
