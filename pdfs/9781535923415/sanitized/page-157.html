<p>Israel’s Role and Salvation</p>
<p>131</p>
<p>future when he chose Israel (11:2). Scripture conrmed that there was a </p>
<p>remnant even in Elijah’s day,</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> one of the worst periods of national apos-</p>
<p>tasy (11:2–4). Likewise, there certainly remained a remnant in Paul’s day </p>
<p>(11:5).</p>
<p>Paul insists that the remnant is chosen by grace (11:5), not by works </p>
<p>(11:6). Paul is building on his earlier argument: the “choice” (eklogē) re-</p>
<p>fers back to 9:11 (where Jacob was the remnant; cf. believers in 8:33); </p>
<p>the contrast between grace (cf. 3:24; 4:16) and works reects the earlier </p>
<p>contrast between faith (dependence on God) and works (3:27–28; 9:32), </p>
<p>as well as the irrelevance of works to chosenness (9:11). He might also </p>
<p>evoke his contrast between grace and works in 4:4. Far from merely as-</p>
<p>serting a claim based on his prior argument, however, Paul quickly cites </p>
<p>biblical support.</p>
<p>How do we know that Israelites can serve God only by his generosity </p>
<p>and not by their own works? Paul indicates that apart from those God </p>
<p>chose, the rest were “hardened” (11:7)—just like Pharaoh the opponent </p>
<p>of Moses (9:17–18)! en Paul cites texts referring not to the remnant, </p>
<p>as in 11:2–3, but instead proving that at some strategic times in Israel’s </p>
<p>history many or most Israelites were hardened (11:8–10). In 11:8, Paul </p>
<p>covers both law and prophets by conating texts with similar warnings: in </p>
<p>Isa 29:10 God gave them the “spirit of stupor,” closing their eyes (blinding </p>
<p>them to the prophetic message); in Deut 29:4 God had not given them </p>
<p>eyes to see nor ears to hear, “to this day.” Isaiah’s context involves judg-</p>
<p>ment, God handing people over to the blindness they have chosen (Isa </p>
<p>29:9–14); Deuteronomy’s context involves failure to discern despite God’s </p>
<p>many miraculous acts of grace (Deut 29:2–8). Paul is probably less con-</p>
<p>cerned with the specic texts he has blended than the typical prophetic </p>
<p>theme they represent, revealing the obduracy of God’s people (cf. Isa 6:10; </p>
<p>42:18–19; Jer 5:21; Ezek 12:2), though this was a human and not speci-</p>
<p>cally Israelite problem.</p>
<p>In 11:9–10 Paul follows the common Greek version of Ps 69:22–23 </p>
<p>(except that he may borrow thēra, “trap,” from Ps 34:8, which also speaks </p>
<p>of a pagis, “snare”). Like some other early Christian writers, Paul applies </p>
<p>Psalm 69 to Jesus (Rom 15:3; cf. Matt 27:34; John 2:17; 19:28), so he pre-</p>
<p>Hasel 1980.</p>
<p>4. 1 Kgs 19:18. Perhaps relevant to Paul’s context (Rom 10:2, 19; 11:11, 14), Elijah’s </p>
<p>own “zeal” (1 Kgs 19:10) was oen emphasized (1 Macc 1:58; Mek. Pisha 1.9), but some </p>
<p>later resented his “disloyal” condemnation of Israel (Mek. Pisha 1.94–100).</p>
