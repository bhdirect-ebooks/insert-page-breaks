<p>while Romans, his longest, has 7114 words.</p>

<p> Because ancient urban argu-</p>
<p>mentation typically involved rhetoric, we shall explore possible connec-</p>
<p>tions with rhetoric below.</p>
<p>One characteristic of letters that is surely relevant here is that au-</p>
<p>thors expected the specied audience of their letters to understand them. </p>
<p>Whether authors always communicated adequately or readers always un-</p>
<p>derstood adequately is another question, but most authors at least tried </p>
<p>to communicate so as to be clearly understood. Paul thus writes to his </p>
<p>audience in Greek. (Greek was the rst language of many non-Italians </p>
<p>in Rome, including the majority of Jews and of Christian ministers who </p>
<p>had come from the east; only in the second century is it clear that many </p>
<p>lower-class, Latin-speaking Romans joined the church.) Paul also appar-</p>
<p>ently writes with what he assumes will be shared cultural assumptions re-</p>
<p>garding language and concepts that he uses without detailed explanation. </p>
<p>Informing ourselves about these shared cultural assumptions will help us </p>
<p>understand his language; this objective is one of the primary purposes </p>
<p>of this commentary (like many others). Better understanding the local </p>
<p>situation in Rome does not mean that Paul would expect the principles </p>
<p>he articulates there to be applicable there only; he does, aer all, apply </p>
<p>many of the same principles to other situations in other congregations. </p>
<p>But noting these situations will help us better understand his argument </p>
<p>and better identify the principles he is applying.</p>
<p>Paul and Rhetoric</p>
<p>Scholars today oen read Paul’s letters in light of ancient rhetoric, a most-</p>
<p>ly positive development. Although some scholars have carried rhetorical </p>
<p>analysis too far, as we shall observe, the development is mostly positive </p>
<p>because ancient rhetoric oers a much more concrete basis for analyzing </p>
<p>Paul’s arguments than modern guesses would.</p>
<p>Two forms of advanced education existed in the Greco-Roman world: </p>
<p>philosophy and rhetoric. e former concerned itself especially with truth </p>
<p>and reality, and the latter with communication and persuasion. Despite </p>
<p>traditional, stereotypical hostility between the two disciplines, most edu-</p>
<p>cated people recognized the value in and made use of both. Nevertheless, </p>
<p>rhetoric was the dominant discipline, being considered more practical for </p>
<p>3. Anderson 1999: 113, noting that Paul departed from conventional epistolary ex-</p>
<p>pectations here (cf. also Malherbe 1977: 16; Demetrius Eloc. 4.228).</p>
