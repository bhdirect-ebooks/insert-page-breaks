<p>Life in Christ and the Spirit</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>there is no condemnation in Christ (8:1). is lack of “condemnation” </p>
<p>recalls how condemnation belonged only to those in Adam, not to those </p>
<p>in Christ (5:16, 18), for God took care of condemning sin in Christ in </p>
<p>our stead (8:3). In Christ one is freed from the body of death (7:24), for </p>
<p>one ruled by the life-giving Spirit rather than by the esh (8:4–13) will be </p>
<p>raised (8:2, 10–13).</p>
<p>Aer addressing the inadequacy of the law to make esh righteous in </p>
<p>7:7–25, in 8:2 Paul shows how the law can be involved in making people </p>
<p>righteous. e law of sin and death from which one is freed (8:2) refers </p>
<p>to the law of sin working in one’s body (7:23, 25). is was Paul’s graphic </p>
<p>way of saying that the law amplies sin (7:8), hence brings death (7:5). </p>
<p>Merely having the law in the mind made one conscious of, but did not </p>
<p>free one from, sin (7:16, 22–23). Liberation would come only by the law </p>
<p>of the Spirit (8:2), the promised Spirit of God that would inscribe God’s </p>
<p>law in the hearts of his people so they would keep his ways (Ezek 36:27). </p>
<p>e Spirit was the “Spirit of life,” who would raise the dead (Ezek 37:14; </p>
<p>Rom 8:10–13).</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>(As noted earlier, Jewish people sometimes used “life” as</p>
<p>shorthand for the life of the coming age.) ose who are in Christ share in </p>
<p>his death and resurrection, and by the fruit of the indwelling Spirit fulll </p>
<p>the moral intention of the law (8:4; cf. 7:4; Gal 5:18, 22–23).</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>e heart of the problem with the law (8:3) was what it was not </p>
<p>designed to do: it righteously teaches right from wrong, but it does not </p>
<p>transform a person to be righteous, to undo the power of sin Adam in-</p>
<p>troduced into humanity. It was “weak” because it depended on “esh” to </p>
<p>fulll it—and esh could never fulll God’s righteousness (see the excur-</p>
<p>sus on “esh” aer 7:14–25). Only Christ by dying could introduce righ-</p>
<p>teousness (see 5:17–19). Although “concerning sin” need not be meant </p>
<p>so narrowly, it probably evokes the biblical language of the levitical sin </p>
<p>oering (over 80 percent of lxx uses of the phrase) to depict Jesus’s mis-</p>
<p>sion (cf. 3:25; 5:8–9). For God to “condemn sin in the esh” was for him </p>
<p>to execute judgment on it in Jesus’s person (cf. Jesus “becoming” sin in 2 </p>
<p>Cor 5:21). By Jesus identifying with Adam, God destroyed sin in Jesus’s </p>
<p>4. Cf. T. Ab. 18:11A; m. Sot. 9:15; perhaps Sib. Or. 4.46; Jos. Asen. 16:14/7–8; still, the </p>
<p>same wording could apply to Gen 2:7 (T. Reu. 2:4). See especially Philip 2005: 137–38; </p>
<p>Raharimanantsoa 2006: 393–96.</p>
<p>5. For the Spirit enabling righteousness, though not as strongly as here, cf. 1QH </p>
<p>4.29–32 (in contrast with esh); 16.11–12; but the primary background is Ezek 36:27.</p>
