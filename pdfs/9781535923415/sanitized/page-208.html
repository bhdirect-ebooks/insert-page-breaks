<p>Romans 16</p>
<p>Closing of Romans (15:14—16:27), cont.</p>
<p>Commending the Bearer (16:1–2)</p>
<p>Although for a time scholars suspected that Romans 16 was the fragment </p>
<p>of a letter to Ephesus appended to Romans, most now agree that it is an </p>
<p>integral part of Romans. Paul knows so many of the people because people </p>
<p>oen traveled to and from Rome, and expelled Jewish believers Paul had </p>
<p>met earlier (like Prisca and Aquila) have now returned there.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>In Rome as elsewhere in the urban Mediterranean world, respected </p>
<p>persons wrote letters of recommendation to their peers to request favors </p>
<p>for others.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Paul elsewhere writes recommendations, but this is his most</p>
<p>explicit (employing the same verb as when mentioning recommendation </p>
<p>letters in 2 Cor 3:1). Why does he preface his more extensive greetings </p>
<p>with this recommendation of a church leader from Cenchrea, Corinth’s </p>
<p>Aegean port town? Phoebe was carrying the letter to the Romans, and </p>
<p>letters sometimes identied special bearers.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Phoebe’s status is important,</p>
<p>because as the letter’s bearer who knew Paul’s intention directly, she might </p>
<p>read it (hence “perform” it orally, and by gestures communicate his em-</p>
<p>phases and ironies) in the congregations in Rome;</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>certainly she would</p>
<p>1. Gamble 1977 has persuaded most subsequent scholars (cf. also arguments in </p>
<p>Fitzmyer 1993: 55–67; Lung-Kwong 1998: 24–35). On frequent migration to Rome, see </p>
<p>e.g., Ramsay 1904: 376; Leon 1960: 238–40; Stambaugh 1988: 90–92; Dresken-Weiland </p>
<p>2003.</p>
<p>2. See e.g., Cicero Fam. 13; Kim 1972; more briey, Stowers 1986: 153–65.</p>
<p>3. E.g., Dio Chrysostom Ep. 1. Mail service existed only for the government; other </p>
<p>letters went with couriers or (more oen) travelers (e.g., Cicero Fam. 1.7.1; 2.1.1; 3.1.2; </p>
<p>5.5.1; Pliny Ep. 2.12.7; Fronto Ad Amic. 2.2; Nicholson 1994; Richards 2004: 177–82).</p>
<p>4. Although a minority, female readers were known (e.g., Schmidt 2005), though she </p>
<p>might delegate the reading proper to a scribe (Jewett 2007: 23). On public readings, see </p>
<p>Shiell 2004: 102–36.</p>
