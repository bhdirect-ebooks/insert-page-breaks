<p>Romans 9:1–5</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>deeply loved his people and sorrow for the resistance of most of them </p>
<p>to his gospel deeply wounded him. Along with his passion for reaching </p>
<p>Gentiles, in fact, his experience of his people’s rejection of the one that </p>
<p>he was absolutely convinced was their rightful deliverer informed his ap-</p>
<p>proach in this letter as a whole. In 9:3 Paul oers himself for Israel, like </p>
<p>Moses of old</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>(and more than Elijah in Rom 11:2–3), and in so doing</p>
<p>he incidentally exemplies the sort of spirit of self-sacrice he invites in </p>
<p>12:1.</p>
<p>In 9:4–5 Paul elaborates the special benets God has provided Israel </p>
<p>(nally following up on a theme he introduced only briey with “rst” </p>
<p>in 3:2).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Several of these reect benets he has already associated with</p>
<p>believers, including Gentile believers (whom he will soon show have been </p>
<p>“graed into” Israel’s heritage, 11:17): adoption as children (8:15, 23), glo-</p>
<p>ry (8:18, 21, 30), and the law (8:2, 4). Although there is a sense in which </p>
<p>these belong particularly to ethnic Israel (11:28; 15:8), all believers also </p>
<p>lay claim to the patriarchs (4:16–18)</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>and promises (4:13–16), as Paul will</p>
<p>soon show again (9:6–9). He will also show later that believers participate </p>
<p>in spiritual service or worship (latreia, 12:1; cf. 15:16).</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Finally and most</p>
<p>importantly, the Messiah comes from Israel in a physical way (cf. also </p>
<p>1:3–4). Given the parallel to Paul’s doxology in 1:25, “who is . . . God </p>
<p>blessed forever” in 9:5 most likely applies to the Christ who is over all, </p>
<p>38.105; idem Cael. 24.60; in letters, Cicero Fam. 14.3.1; 14.4.1; Pliny Ep. 5.21.6; 2 Cor </p>
<p>2:4; Phil 3:18); for pathos in Roman rhetorical appeals, see Krachick 2001: 52–56 (more </p>
<p>generally, see Olbricht and Sumney 2001); for weeping with others, e.g., Cicero Fam. </p>
<p>14.3.1; 14.4.1. Some Stoics may have disapproved (Engberg-Pedersen 2000: 96–97; Arius </p>
<p>Didymus Epit. 2.7.10, p. 56.6–16; 2.7.10a, p. 58.11–16; 2.7.10b, p. 58.26–27; 2.7.11e, p. </p>
<p>68.17–18), but in practice cf. Ps.-Heraclitus Ep. 5; Fitzgerald 1988: 199.</p>
<p>2. Exod 32:32 (with Schoeps 1961: 134, and many others); for the limits of such inter-</p>
<p>cessors’ eectiveness, cf. Jer 15:1; Ezek 14:14, 20. Roman Gentiles respected citizens who </p>
<p>oered themselves for their people (Valerius Maximus 1.5.2; Plutarch Cam. 5.6), so they </p>
<p>could understand the sentiment.</p>
<p>3. Paul’s rhetorical sensitivity is clear in 9:4: making the list sound fuller by polysyn-</p>
<p>deton (explicit conjunctions), Paul also chooses nouns ending in -thesia, -a, -ai, -thesia, </p>
<p>-a, -ai (Paul must break the pattern in 9:5 with two masculine nouns). e present tense </p>
<p>verb reveals God’s continuing activity with regard to ethnic Israel (Piper 1983: 8).</p>
<p>4. e phrase (also in 11:28; 15:8) applies especially to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob </p>
<p>(Sipra Behuq. pq. 8.269.2.5), although it need not be limited to them (cf. 1 Cor 10:1).</p>
<p>5. Paul nowhere else in Romans applies “covenants” to believers, but their sharing in </p>
<p>the new covenant (explicit in 1 Cor 11:25; 2 Cor 3:6; Gal 3:17; 4:24) is implied in Rom </p>
<p>2:28–29; 7:6.</p>
