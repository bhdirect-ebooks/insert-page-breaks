<p>Jesus’s deity only where he uses the explicit title “God” (cf. perhaps 9:5), </p>
<p>he actually assumes Jesus’s deity fairly oen. In fact, for Paul, “Lord” can </p>
be a divine title no less than “God” is (cf. 1 Cor 8:5–6); Paul employs this
<p>title for Jesus, and sometimes the Father, roughly thirty-seven times in </p>
<p>Romans.</p>
<p>anksgiving (1:8–15)</p>
<p>In what constitutes a single long sentence in Greek, Paul emphasizes his </p>
<p>appreciation for the Roman believers. He explains that he would have </p>
<p>eagerly visited them to serve them with his apostolic ministry, as he has </p>
<p>been gied to serve all the Gentiles, but that he has been detained so far </p>
<p>(1:8–15). Toward the end of his letter he will indicate that he has been </p>
<p>detained by spiritually needier destinations (15:19–22).</p>
<p>Paul starts by thanking God for them (1:8). anksgivings were com-</p>
<p>mon (though by no means pervasive) in ancient letters, and Paul nearly </p>
<p>always thanks God for the churches to whom he writes (though this fea-</p>
<p>ture is conspicuously omitted in his opening rebuke to the Galatians).</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul not only thanks God for them, but regularly prays for them (1:9);</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> </p>
<p>calling a deity to “witness” underlined the veracity of one’s claim, since </p>
<p>deities were expected to avenge false claims about them.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> Paul prays es-</p>
<p>pecially that he might visit them (1:10) so he can serve them the way God </p>
<p>has gied him to do (1:11).</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>“In God’s will” (1:10) does not absolutely</p>
<p>23. If humanity in general can be charged with failing to thank God (1:21), the same </p>
<p>charge can hardly be laid against Paul (6:17; 7:25; 16:4; and passim in his letters)! On </p>
<p>thanksgivings, see Schubert 1939; esp. O’Brien 1977; cf. e.g., Fronto Ad M. Caes. 5.41 </p>
<p>(56).</p>
<p>24. Letter writers oen expressed prayers (or wishes) for their recipients; e.g., P. </p>
<p>Giess. 17.3–4; P. Lond. 42.2–4; P. Oxy. 1296.4–5; Fronto Ad M. Caes. 1.2.2; 5.25 (40). </p>
<p>“Unceasingly” may involve greater frequency than daily prayer times, but might be hy-</p>
<p>perbolic (a common gure, e.g., Rhet. Her. 4.33.44); “unceasing mention” seems to refer </p>
<p>to times of feasts and sacrices in 1 Macc 12:11.</p>
<p>25. For Jewish people calling God to witness, see e.g., Josephus Ant. 4.40, 46; T. Reu. </p>
<p>1:6; 6:9; among Gentiles, e.g., Homer Od. 1.273; 14.158; Xenophon Cyr. 4.6.10.</p>
<p>26. Letters oen expressed a genuine desire to visit (Anderson 1999: 207); even more </p>
<p>frequently, they expressed deep aection (Cicero Fam. 7.14.2; Pliny Ep. 3.3.1; Fronto </p>
<p>Ad M. Caes. 1.3.1–5; 2.2.2; 3.9.1; 4.2.1) and longing (P. Oxy. 528.6–9; Cicero Fam. 1.9.1; </p>
<p>16.1.1; Att. 2.18; 12.3; Dio Chrysostom Ep. 3; Pliny the Younger Ep. 3.17.1–3; 6.4.2–5; </p>
<p>6.7.1–3; 7.5.1–2; Fronto Ad M. Caes. 2.4; 2.10.3; 2.14; 3.9.2; 3.19; 4.5.3; 4.9). One might </p>
<p>also explain reasons for one’s delay (CPJ 2:219, §431).</p>
