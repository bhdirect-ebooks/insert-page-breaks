<p>Made Right by Trusting Christ</p>

<p>Scripture supported Paul’s contention that those who violated God’s </p>
<p>law were uncircumcised in heart (Rom 2:25; Lev 26:41; Jer 4:4; 9:25–26); </p>
<p>Paul goes beyond Scripture simply in arguing the converse, namely, that </p>
<p>those who keep God’s law are circumcised in God’s sight (Rom 2:26). </p>
Physical circumcision was a dividing issue; many Roman Gentiles criti-
<p>cized Jews for this practice, and it remained a primary barrier for Gentile </p>
<p>men desiring to join God’s people. Most Jews did not believe that Gentiles </p>
<p>needed to be circumcised to be saved; they needed it only to become </p>
<p>members of Israel’s covenant.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> Paul thus prepares here for his later argu-</p>
<p>ment about Gentile believers being graed into Israel’s heritage alongside </p>
<p>Jewish believers (4:16; 11:17).</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Literal circumcision appears in far fewer biblical texts than one </p>
<p>would expect from its later emphasis (although it is crucial in most of </p>
<p>these, especially Gen 17; Ex 4:26; Lev 12:3; Josh 5:2–8);</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> but Jewish peo-</p>
<p>ple emphasized it especially rigorously in the centuries before Paul’s day </p>
<p>as a signicant distinctive of national identity. Without rejecting physical </p>
<p>circumcision, Paul regarded spiritual circumcision (Deut 10:16; 30:6; Lev </p>
<p>26:41; Jer 4:4; 9:25–26; cf. Ezek 44:7, 9) as essential and more crucial than </p>
<p>the physical covenant “sign.” Physical circumcision remained acceptable </p>
<p>for Jewish believers, but the imposition of circumcision on Gentile be-</p>
<p>lievers risked alienating people from the covenant needlessly (cf. 1 Cor </p>
<p>7:18–19; Gal 5:6; 6:15).</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>For Paul, the promised gi of the Spirit (2:29)</p>
<p>conrmed God’s acceptance of Gentiles into his new covenant, obviating </p>
<p>the need for a mere symbol of the covenant that simply pointed to it.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>25. For Jewish views of Gentiles, see Donaldson 1997b: 52–74.</p>
<p>26. e Gentile practitioner “judging” the Jewish nonpractitioner may involve </p>
<p>merely being a comparison standard for God’s judgment (see e.g., Matt 12:41–42/Luke </p>
<p>11:31–32; Lev. Rab. 2:9; Pesiq. Rab. 35:3; comparable scenarios involving other kinds </p>
<p>of gures in ’Abot R. Nat. 6A; 12, §30B), but some Jewish eschatological scenarios did </p>
<p>involve the righteous judging the wicked (1 En. 91:12; 95:3; 98:12; 1QpHab 5.4; 4Q418 </p>
<p>frag. 69, 2.7–8; Sipre Deut. 47.2.8).</p>
<p>27. at it was symbolic identication rather than ontologically ecacious is clear </p>
<p>from where it had been omitted (Josh 5:2–8; cf. Exod 4:25).</p>
28. Some other individuals allowed this concession, at least in some extraordinary
<p>cases (Josephus Ant. 20.41; see further Watson 2007: 75–78); but this would be a minor-</p>
<p>ity view in Jerusalem and probably even in most Diaspora synagogues.</p>
<p>29. Generally, when Paul contrasts “esh” and “Spirit,” as in 2:28–29, he refers to </p>
<p>God’s Spirit (see e.g., 1:3–4; 8:4–9, 13; cf. Gal 3:3; 4:29; 5:16–17; 6:8; Phil 3:3). e Spirit </p>
<p>is the foretaste of the future age (Rom 8:23; 2 Cor 1:22; 5:5), and the symbol is irrelevant </p>
<p>compared to the new creation (Gal 6:15).</p>
