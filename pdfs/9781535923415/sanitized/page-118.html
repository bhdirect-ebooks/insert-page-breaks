<p>Romans 7:14–25</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>contrasts with the larger context are simply too great to t the Christian </p>
<p>life as he describes it, even had Paul thought himself an unusually weak </p>
<p>Christian.</p>
<p>Rom 7:7–25 Believers in the context</p>
<p>Law, sin, and death (7:7–13) Freed from law (7:4, 6; 8:2), sin </p>
<p>(6:18, 20, 22) and death (5:21; 6:23; </p>
<p>8:2)</p>
<p>I am eshy (7:14) You are not in the (sphere of) esh, </p>
<p>if Christ lives in you (8:9); no longer </p>
<p>in the esh (7:5)</p>
<p>I have been sold</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>under (as a slave</p>
<p>to) sin (7:14; cf. 7:23)</p>
<p>Believers have been freed from </p>
<p>enslavement to sin (6:18, 20, 22); </p>
<p>they are “redeemed” (3:24)</p>
<p>Knowing right (in the law) without </p>
<p>the ability to do right (7:15–23)</p>
<p>Power to live righteously (8:4), not </p>
<p>conferred by external law (8:3); </p>
<p>contrast 2:17–24</p>
<p>Sin dwells in (and rules) me (7:17, 20) e Spirit dwells in believers (8:9, 11)</p>
<p>Nothing good dwells in me (i.e., in </p>
<p>me as esh; 7:18)</p>
<p>e Spirit dwells in believers (8:9, 11)</p>
<p>e law of sin dominates his bodily </p>
<p>members (7:23)</p>
<p>Believers are freed from the law of </p>
<p>sin (8:2)</p>
<p>Sin wins the war and captures “me” </p>
<p>as a prisoner (7:23)</p>
<p>(Believers should win the spiritual </p>
<p>war, cf. 2 Cor 10:3–5)</p>
<p>I want freedom from this “body of </p>
<p>death” (body destined for death; </p>
<p>7:24)</p>
<p>Believers who do not live for their </p>
<p>own bodily desires (8:10–13) are </p>
<p>freed from the way of death (8:2), </p>
<p>in contrast to those who follow the </p>
<p>esh (8:6, 13)</p>
<p>A slave to the law of sin in his esh, </p>
<p>vs. his mind (7:25)</p>
<p>Believers are freed from the law of </p>
<p>sin (8:2; cf. 6:18, 20, 22); the mental </p>
<p>perspective either belongs to the </p>
<p>Spirit or the esh (8:5–9)</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>scholars (e.g., Stowers 1994: 264–68; idem 2003: 537; Tobin 2004: 10, 226–27) compare </p>
<p>the rhetorical technique of prosopopoiia (or, more technically, ēthopopoiia; Hermogenes </p>
<p>Progymn. 9, On Ethopoeia, 20–22), writing a speech as if someone else, an approach at </p>
<p>least as old as Origen, though tentatively (Reasoner 2005: 69).</p>
<p>18. Cf. God “selling” Israel into captivity for their sins (e.g., Judg 2:14; 3:8; 4:2; 10:7; </p>
