<p>Romans 9:6–29</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>name among the nations, so God has hardened Israel to bring a chance </p>
<p>for salvation among the Gentiles (11:7, 25; cf. 2 Cor 3:14).</p>
<p>Jewish people rightly armed God’s sovereignty alongside his elec-</p>
tion of Israel. Yet Paul argues that, with respect to individual salvation,
<p>God being sovereign precludes him from being bound to choose on the </p>
<p>basis of ethnicity. He can save Gentiles as well as Jews, and on the terms </p>
<p>he chooses. e interlocutor who thinks this unjust (9:14; cf. 3:3) now </p>
<p>objects that for God to be this sovereign would abnegate human respon-</p>
<p>sibility (9:19), a moral argument parallel to 3:7. Paul will turn to Jewish </p>
<p>responsibility in 9:32, but rst he disposes of the propriety of this ob-</p>
<p>jection altogether. He again responds from Israel’s Scripture, in Isa 45:9 </p>
<p>(cf. Isa 29:16): will the pot complain to the potter about how it has been </p>
<p>made? e context in Isaiah 45 is Israel’s salvation, through God’s sover-</p>
<p>eign purposes in international history (an idea Paul will address in ch. </p>
<p>11); the context in the similar passage in Isaiah 29 is the justness of God’s </p>
<p>judgment against Israel’s intransigence (Isa 29:1–16).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>In 9:22–24, however, it is clear that Paul’s emphasis on God’s sover-</p>
<p>eignty continues to focus especially on grace. Paul has already indicated </p>
<p>the purpose for which God was forming vessels for glory: conformity with </p>
<p>his Son’s image (8:29). God makes vessels for honor, which is his interest, </p>
<p>but endures those that are objects of his wrath for the sake of the oth-</p>
<p>ers (9:22–23).</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>In the context of the text from Exod 9:16 just cited, God</p>
<p>endured the objects destined for wrath and destruction, like Pharaoh, so </p>
<p>that he could “make his power known” (9:22) and lavish his glory on his </p>
<p>people (9:23), just as he demonstrated his “power” in Pharaoh to make </p>
<p>known his name (related to his glory) in 9:17 (quoting Exod 9:16). But </p>
<p>as that text had declared that he would make known his power and name </p>
<p>“throughout the earth,” Paul can infer that God cares about Gentiles as </p>
<p>well as Jews (9:24). Just as the new exodus of salvation evokes the pattern </p>
<p>16. e potter’s right over the clay in Rom 9:21 might also evoke Jer 18:3–6 (Hays </p>
<p>1989: 65–66); it would not be unusual for Paul to have linked the common images. </p>
<p>For creatures of “clay” acknowledging God’s sovereignty, see 1QS 11.21–22; 1QH 1.21; </p>
<p>3.23–24; 12.24–25; 13.14–15; 18.11–12, 24–27; Sir 33:12–13; cf. analogous rhetorical </p>
<p>questions regarding his sovereignty, Wis 12:12; L.A.B. 53:13.</p>
<p>17. Fashioning clay into both vessels for clean uses and those for unclean uses (per-</p>
<p>haps chamber pots and the like) recalls Wis 15:7, although it lacks contextual resonances </p>
<p>(the context involves making idols; cf. 2 Tim 2:20–21). e world existed so the righteous </p>
<p>could exist (4 Ezra 6:59; 7:11; 9:13; 2 Bar. 15:7; 21:24; Sipre Deut. 47.3.1–2); the wicked </p>
<p>were created for destruction (4Q418 f69 ii.6).</p>
