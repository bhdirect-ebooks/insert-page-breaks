<p>Romans 1:1–7</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>of Scripture appear in this letter.) In the Prophets proper, the “good news” </p>
<p>is especially the promise that God would establish peace and blessing for </p>
<p>his people (Isa 40:9; 52:7; 60:6; 61:1), and Paul proclaims that this ancient </p>
<p>promise is now being fullled in Jesus (see comment on 1:16), a theme </p>
<p>to which he will oen return (see “promise” in 4:13, 14, 16, 20, 21; 9:4, 8, </p>
<p>9; 15:8).</p>
<p>What is the content of the good news foretold by the prophets? e </p>
<p>prophets associated their good news of Israel’s restoration with the com-</p>
<p>ing of the promised Davidic king and the hope of resurrection. In 1:3–4 </p>
<p>Paul declares that his good news concerns God’s “Son.”</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>As a descendant</p>
<p>of David (1:3; cf. 15:12), Jesus could be rightful heir to Israel’s throne; </p>
<p>but once a king was enthroned, he was adopted by God (2 Sam 7:14–16; </p>
<p>Pss 2:6–7; 89:26–33). Jesus was not only descended from David (as some </p>
<p>other people were), but attested as God’s Son by the Spirit, who raised </p>
<p>him from the dead and hence exalted him as Lord.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Of course, Jesus is</p>
<p>not God’s “Son” only in the ordinary royal sense (cf. Rom 8:3, 29; Isa </p>
<p>9:6–7), but the good news that God has established</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>a king, and hence</p>
<p>his kingdom, sets Paul’s preaching of Jesus squarely in the context of the </p>
<p>ot promises.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Many Judeans regularly praised God for his power that would one </p>
<p>day be expressed in raising the dead;</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Paul likewise treats resurrection</p>
<p>8. Reusing earlier poetry was common (Menander Rhetor 2.4.393, lines 9–12), and </p>
<p>many argue forcefully that Paul draws here on a pre-Pauline tradition (Beasley-Murray </p>
<p>1980: 147–54; Dunn 1988: 1:5; Jewett 2007: 24–25, 97–108); their evidence allows this </p>
<p>usage but need not require it (see Poythress 1976; Moo 1996: 45–46; Haacker 2003: </p>
<p>108–9; Anderson 1999: 207 n. 45). Paul might simply shi to grand epideictic style, ap-</p>
<p>propriate to discussing the sublime or deities, when elaborating Christology. At the least </p>
<p>it cannot be a “hymn,” since it lacks meter.</p>
9. e contrast between “esh” and “Spirit” here lays emphasis on the divine em-
<p>powerment involved in the latter (see 8:4, 5, 6, 9, 13). It does not denigrate the eshly </p>
<p>relationship, but relativizes its importance (cf. 4:1; 9:3, 5), perhaps why Paul rarely em-</p>
<p>phasizes this aspect of messiahship relevant to his contemporaries (but cf. also Mark </p>
<p>12:35–37).</p>
<p>10. On horizō as “appointed” or “established” with reference to Jesus, see also Acts </p>
<p>10:42; 17:31.</p>
<p>11. Although not relevant exclusively to Rome, this central message of Jesus as Israel’s </p>
<p>messianic ruler would rearm Roman believers who had apparently already suered </p>
<p>for that claim (Suetonius Claud. 25.4; see our introduction). It also contrasted with the </p>
<p>“merely procedural” deications of Roman emperors (Elliott 2008: 71–72).</p>
<p>12. In the second of the “Eighteen Benedictions” (cf. m. Roš Haš. 4:5); similarly in later </p>
<p>Islam (Qur’an 42.9; 46.33; 57.2). Contrast pagan deities (e.g., Ovid Metam. 2.617–18).</p>
