<p>Jew to think in these terms.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Paul does not clearly allegorize food laws</p>
<p>here; he seems to treat them as a matter of the old form of the law ap-</p>
<p>plicable only to Israel (and in Lev 11, they were intended distinctively for </p>
<p>Israel).</p>
<p>For Paul, foods themselves are religiously neutral; that is, one may </p>
<p>keep food customs because of upbringing, cultural preference or ethnic </p>
<p>attachment, but one who keeps them out of the belief that it is religiously </p>
<p>protable is “weak in faith” (14:1). (Paul might even formulate this des-</p>
<p>ignation as a contrast with the ancestral archetype of faith who was “not </p>
<p>weak in faith,” 4:19.) is contrasts with one who genuinely believes and </p>
<p>hence may eat anything (14:2); nothing is really intrinsically “clean” or </p>
<p>“unclean” (14:14).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Paul’s agenda in this chapter is not to denigrate the </p>
<p>keeping of these food customs, but to keep those who viewed them-</p>
<p>selves as “strong” from looking down on the “weak.” Paul does not want </p>
<p>stumbling blocks placed before those who continue to keep kosher by </p>
<p>others eating non-kosher food in front of them (14:13–21).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Although</p>
<p>Paul spent much of the letter establishing from Jewish Scripture that God </p>
<p>welcomed Gentiles into the covenant, he is now emphasizing his central </p>
<p>issue for the Gentile majority among Roman believers, namely, that they </p>
<p>should not look down on Jews (11:18–21) or on those who keep the laws </p>
<p>(ch. 14). Paul warns against abstainers disdaining eaters (14:3, 10), and </p>
<p>against eaters “judging” abstainers (14:3, 4, 10, 13); he frequently used </p>
<p>“judge” (krinō and cognates) earlier in the letter, probably including for </p>
<p>Jews judging Gentiles (2:1, 3). It is true that some may “fall” (14:4), like </p>
<p>the Jewish branches in 11:22 (falling is identical with “stumbling,” falling </p>
<p>away from the faith, 14:13, 21; cf. 9:32–33; 11:9, 11),</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>but God is able</p>
<p>15. See Let. Aris. 128–29, 147 (cf. 223); cf. T. Ash. 2:9–10. Some think that Let. Aris. </p>
<p>reects Pythagorean inuence (Berthelot 2001). Some also allegorized regulations con-</p>
<p>cerning Isis’s priests (which included food rules; see Plutarch Isis 4, Mor. 352DE).</p>
<p>16. On some plausible views, this might have occurred sometimes at common meals </p>
<p>(e.g., Lung-Kwong 1998: 140; Das 2003: 68). Some envision common meetings (in </p>
<p>Corinth) in 16:23; perhaps some house congregations were mixed. But certainty seems </p>
<p>dicult, as Jews did not concern themselves with what Gentiles or God fearers ate, </p>
<p>though claims of “spiritual” proselytism (cf. 11:17) might raise dierent expectations. If </p>
the meals were potlucks (and individuals rather than hosts seem addressed here), no one
<p>could force Jewish attenders to eat non-kosher food.</p>
<p>17. For the seriousness of “stumbling,” see e.g., Ezek 14:3–7; Sir 9:5; 25:21; 34:7, 17; </p>
<p>35:15; 39:24; 1QS 2.12; 3.24; 1QpHab 11.7–8; 4Q174 f1 2i:8–9; T. Reu. 4:7.</p>
