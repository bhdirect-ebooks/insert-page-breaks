<p>Life in Christ and the Spirit</p>

<p>it from a Christian perspective. Nevertheless, he is not writing an auto-</p>
<p>biography, but highlighting an experience meant to communicate a truth </p>
<p>to his audience; if he depicts life under the law, he depicts an experience </p>
<p>more widely shared. Because he describes life under the law in 7:7–13, </p>
<p>what he depicts is not intended as his current experience; because his </p>
<p>verbs are past tense in these verses, most commentators agree on this </p>
<p>point (somewhat more controversial are 7:14–25, treated below).</p>
<p>If Paul is writing in another persona, who is the persona? Two pro-</p>
<p>posals are most common, and both have some merit. Many see Adamic </p>
<p>humanity here. Whether there is any deliberate echo of the fall here,</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>emphasis on Adam bringing death in the recent pericope 5:12–21 pre-</p>
<p>sumably does inform this passage. Others, given the prominence of the </p>
<p>law, highlight Israel as the background of the speaker here, and whatever </p>
<p>else the speaker represents, it involves human experience under the law </p>
<p>(i.e., Israel’s experience, far more than Adam’s, 5:13).</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Israel sought to</p>
<p>establish their own righteousness by the law rather than relying on God </p>
<p>to put them right with him (9:30–32; 10:3). e verbal echoes are not </p>
<p>compelling for either approach, but the context may be suggestive. Most </p>
<p>importantly, whatever the particulars, we may concur that Paul depicts </p>
<p>life under the law without God’s gi of righteousness.</p>
<p>e Flesh and Sin (7:14–25)</p>
<p>Whereas most commentators recognize that 7:8–13, which uses past </p>
<p>tense verbs, does not refer to Paul’s present state, they are somewhat more </p>
divided in their assessment of 7:14–25.
<p>16</p>
<p>Nevertheless, most do recognize</p>
<p>that Paul speaks in a voice other than his own present person here;</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>14. To retain continuity with Adam, some compare “deceived” in 7:11 to Eve’s decep-</p>
<p>tion (2 Cor 11:3; Gen 3:13; Josephus Ant. 1.48), although the term appears in many other </p>
<p>settings. Deception is at best a faint echo (and the “commandment” applies better to the </p>
<p>“Israel” interpretation), but Paul has already linked “death” to Adam (5:12, 14, 17).</p>
<p>15. Cf. Paul’s shi from plural to singular in 3:5, 7 (as in 7:5–6; 7:7–25). Zion speaks </p>
<p>in the rst-person singular in Lam 1:11–22. Cf. Moo 1986.</p>
<p>16. Reacting against Pelagians, the later Augustine came to depict Rom 7 as the </p>
<p>Christian life (with most Latin fathers); most church fathers, however, especially in the </p>
<p>east, viewed it as non-Christian (see Bray 1998: 189–99; Reasoner 2005: 67–84). e </p>
<p>medieval Western church, Luther, and Calvin followed the dominant Western tradition; </p>
<p>Erasmus, Wesley and Pietists followed the tradition of the Greek fathers.</p>
