<p>Romans 5:1–11</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>at the love is here “poured out” through the Spirit might evoke the </p>
<p>promised outpouring of the prophetic Spirit in Joel 2:28–29 (cf. Isa 32:15; </p>
<p>44:3; Ezek 39:29), so that the Spirit here may speak to or inspire believers’ </p>
<p>hearts with God’s love (cf. Rom 8:16).</p>
<p>Hope is secure because it rests on God’s love (5:5), which is dem-</p>
<p>onstrated in Christ’s sacrice (5:6–9). Paul has already noted that Christ </p>
<p>was delivered for our transgressions (4:25); now he elaborates on humans’ </p>
<p>state as transgressors, and how committed God’s love was to saving them. </p>
<p>Normally a person would be reluctant to die for another person, although </p>
<p>there would be some exceptions for a good person (5:6–7).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>But Christ</p>
<p>died for sinners (5:8), objects of God’s wrath (5:9),</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>God’s enemies (5:10).</p>
<p>By his death he reconciled these sinners to God, overcoming the enmity, </p>
<p>and those in solidarity with him would be saved eschatologically because </p>
<p>of his resurrection (5:11).</p>
<p>ese verses (5:6–11) help esh out what Paul means about Jesus dy-</p>
<p>ing because of our transgressions (4:24), although Paul will also provide </p>
<p>additional models of Jesus’s death aerward (especially 5:18–19; 6:3–10). </p>
<p>at Jesus’s blood here propitiates God’s wrath (5:9) ts some biblical and </p>
<p>other ancient conceptions. Because crucixion was not primarily bloody </p>
<p>(in contrast to execution by decapitation),</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>the mention of blood is</p>
<p>theologically signicant.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> While modern theology may be oen uncom-</p>
<p>fortable with the idea of God’s wrath, we ought not to suppose that Paul </p>
<p>shared such scruples (cf. Rom 9:22; 1 Cor 1:18; 3:17; 10:8–10; 11:30–32; </p>
<p>8. On death for friends in Greek thought, see Epictetus Disc. 2.7.3; Diogenes Laertius </p>
<p>10.120; further Keener 2000a: 383–84. Jewish martyrdoms were for God (so also Origen </p>
<p>Comm. Rom. on 5:7), and one should not even give to sinners (Sir 12:4, 7). A good man </p>
<p>was thought to be rare (Diogenes Laertius 1.77, 88; 9.2.20; see Rom 3:23).</p>
<p>9. Salvation from God’s wrath in the day of judgment, appears also in 1 ess 1:10; </p>
<p>5:9; for this eschatological use of wrath in Romans, see e.g., 2:5; 9:22.</p>
<p>10. Although John 20:25 and probably Luke 24:39–40 (most mss) presuppose Jesus </p>
<p>nailed to the cross, victims could even be simply tied to it. Crucixion could be “bloody,” </p>
<p>but that was not primary; the language points instead to the theology of guilt for in-</p>
<p>nocent blood (e.g., Matt 23:35) or of sacrice (probably here).</p>
<p>11. With many commentators (albeit against others). For blood and atonement, see </p>
<p>e.g., Exod 29:36; 30:10; 34:25; Lev 4:26; 16:27, 30; cf. 1 Sam 3:14; 2 Chron 29:24. Such </p>
<p>atonement could appease God’s wrath (Num 16:46). Sin oerings are oen connected </p>
<p>with atonement (Exod 29:36; 30:10; Lev 4:20; 5:6; 6:30; 7:7; 9:7; 10:17; 12:8; 14:19; 15:15, </p>
<p>30; 16:6, 11, 27; Num 6:11; 8:12; 15:25; 28:22; 29:5, 11; 2 Chron 29:24; Ezek 45:17), as are </p>
<p>guilt oerings (Lev 5:6, 16, 18; 7:7; 14:21; 19:22). Vicarious atonement appears as early </p>
<p>as Canaanite and Hittite ritual and was certainly widely understood in Paul’s day, both in </p>
<p>paganism and (contrary to some proposals) in Judaism (later, among Tannaim, cf. e.g., </p>
<p>Kim 2001–5: summarized on 143–45).</p>
