<p>Excursus: Dikaiosunē in Romans</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>translations render some of its occurrences in Romans) or acquittal. Those </p>
<p>who argue for legal acquittal rightly emphasize God’s generosity, or “grace,” </p>
<p>as opposed to human achievement. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, Paul does not think only of “acquittal,” which is only one </p>
<p>element of the term’s normal sense. Acquittal does not dominate the entire </p>
<p>letter, which goes on to address conduct (Rom 6; 12:1—15:7);</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>moreover,</p>
<p>when God pronounces something done, one expects this to happen, not merely </p>
<p>produce a legal ﬁction (Gen 1:3; 2 Cor 4:6).</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>In Romans, righteousness is</p>
a transforming gift. It is a divine gift rather than human achievement (Rom
<p>5:17, 21), but God’s gift also enables obedience (cf. 1:5; 2:8; 5:19; 15:18), </p>
<p>i.e., right living (6:16–18; 8:2–4; 13:14). In theological terms, justiﬁcation </p>
<p>is inseparable from regeneration.</p>
<p>Although disputed, “from faith to faith” may simply mean that God’s </p>
<p>righteousness revealed in the gospel is a matter of faith from start to </p>
<p>nish.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>Romans oen uses pistis (“faith”) and its verb cognate pisteuō</p>
<p>(“believe”). Apart from disputed instances (e.g., 3:22), faith is normally </p>
<p>in God or Christ (most obvious in cases where the verb is being used). </p>
<p>Whatever else “faith” means for Paul, it is not a human work, whether </p>
<p>physical or (as sometimes in Protestantism) mental in nature (Rom </p>
<p>3:27–28; 4:5; 9:32; Gal 2:16; 3:2, 5). It involves dependence on God’s righ-</p>
<p>teousness. is means not a Kierkegaardian “leap into the dark” (reacting </p>
<p>to the Kantian consignment of faith to the category of subjectivity), but </p>
<p>embracing truth in the gospel (in contrast to the false ideologies of the </p>
<p>world; cf. Rom 1:18–23, 28). We should note, however, that just as “righ-</p>
<p>teousness” involves transformation, so the term pistis includes the sense </p>
<p>of “faithfulness”—loyalty and allegiance—and not simply an intellectual </p>
<p>51. Schlatter 1995: 26–27.</p>
<p>52. is “transformative” righteousness view (vs. mere acquittal) is the one dominant </p>
<p>in most of church history (Fitzmyer 1993: 118–19).</p>
<p>53. Cf. the construction in 2 Cor 2:16 (a rhetorical ourish, as in Menander Rhetor </p>
<p>2.3, 378.29–30; Ps 84:7; Jer 9:3). Alternatively, God’s righteousness may be revealed on </p>
<p>the basis of faith in the gospel, generating more faith (cf. Rom 10:17; the construction in </p>
<p>Gal 6:8). “From faith” might counter the assertion that it was “from works” (cf. 3:20; 4:2; </p>
<p>9:11, 32; 11:6); it also reects Hab 2:4 lxx. Many understand it as from God’s faithfulness </p>
<p>(3:3) to human faithfulness, yet one would expect Paul’s context to clarify such dierent </p>
<p>uses more adequately.</p>
