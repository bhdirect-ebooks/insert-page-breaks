<p>to emphasize this qualiﬁcation). Paul cooperated with the Jerusalem church’s </p>
<p>identiﬁcation with their culture (which was also his culture, Acts 21:20–26), </p>
<p>but not to the extent of honoring such nationalism above his commitment </p>
<p>to the Gentile mission (Acts 22:21–22). When Christians are more loyal to </p>
<p>our ethnicity or nation than to Christ’s body, when nationalism or racism cor-</p>
<p>rupts our love for fellow believers, we have gone beyond giving Caesar what </p>
<p>is Caesar’s to giving Caesar what is God’s. On many other points, however, </p>
<p>Christian ethicists debate the boundaries between those two spheres.</p>

<p>more generally (13:8), but avoiding nancial indebtedness was a common </p>
<p>topic in antiquity.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>While moralists oen warned against debts, Paul’s far</p>
<p>more demanding alternative strikes at the heart of the obligation/reci-</p>
<p>procity ethic of ancient Mediterranean culture: love, which gives freely </p>
<p>without thought of fullling or seeking repayment (13:8–10; cf. 12:9; Gal </p>
<p>5:13–14). In a particular setting where Jewish and Gentile Christians </p>
<p>diered over the law (cf. Rom 3:19–31; 7:1–25; 9:30—10:13), recalling </p>
<p>them to this basic thrust of the law summoned them to consideration and </p>
<p>unity. Other Jewish writers also recognized the importance of the love </p>
<p>commandment,</p>
<p>20</p>
but Paul’s summary of individual commands may also
<p>recall the earlier-specied failure of some who arm themselves as law </p>
<p>keepers (adultery in 2:22; the in 2:21; immoral desire in 7:7–8) as well as </p>
<p>others (murder in 1:29; immoral desire in 1:24; 6:12).</p>

<p>In 13:11–14 Paul concludes his general exhortations with an appar-</p>
<p>ently eschatological moral summons. Although Paul’s audience in Rome </p>
<p>could not compare 1 ess 5:2–8 as we can to recognize the eschatologi-</p>
<p>cal character of this exhortation, it probably reects more general early </p>
<p>Christian usage of eschatological images rather than only a recycled ser-</p>
<p>mon of Paul (cf. Mark 13:33–37; Matt 24:43). e “day,” then, is the “day </p>
