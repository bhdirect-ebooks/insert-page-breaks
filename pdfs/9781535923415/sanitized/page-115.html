<p>Excursus: Paul and the Law in Romans</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>“faith” approach to the law differs, however, from attempts to achieve righ-</p>
<p>teousness by works (10:3, 5–8). The status of the law appears problematic so </p>
<p>often in Romans precisely because it is the abuse of the law that is most at </p>
<p>issue. Had that abuse actually represented God’s intention, it would have left </p>
<p>new Gentile converts at a severe disadvantage vis-à-vis Jewish people raised </p>
<p>with the law.</p>
<p>Paul sometimes uses deliberatively provocative statements about the law </p>
<p>(even more so in Galatians than in Romans) for his rhetorical purpose. We </p>
<p>should not use such statements to sum up Paul’s whole theology of the law </p>
<p>(or even assume that, from his occasional letters, we have his entire theology </p>
<p>of the law). Still less should we discard all insights that we might arrive at </p>
<p>inductively through studying the Pentateuch, based on Paul’s approach in </p>
<p>speciﬁc polemical or pedagogical contexts. Nevertheless, Paul’s point is criti-</p>
<p>cal: merely knowing and, as best as possible, following the letter of biblical </p>
<p>precepts does not make one righteous. Rather, the heart of Scripture teaches </p>
<p>about the God who graciously makes righteous by his own saving acts. Jew and </p>
<p>Gentile must thus come to God on the same terms, through God’s saving acts, </p>
<p>which now are available to both in Christ. The law is not meant as a vehicle </p>
<p>for self-improvement; it is meant as God’s revelation that points us to his way </p>
<p>of righteousness (3:21).</p>
<p>e Law and Sin (7:7–13)</p>
<p>Paul’s larger argument about one way of salvation for Jew and Gentile </p>
<p>(1:16) requires him to give central place to the law in his argument, which </p>
divided Jew and Gentile (2:12–14, 17, 26–27; 3:27–31; 4:16; 9:30–32). Paul
<p>thus oen addresses the law (2:12–27; 3:19–21, 27–31; 4:13–16; 5:13, 20; </p>
<p>6:14–15; 9:31—10:5; 13:8–10), but nowhere in as much detail as here.</p>
<p>Paul’s analogous treatment of freedom from sin (6:12–23) and the </p>
<p>law (7:1–6) raises the obvious objection: is Paul identifying the law with </p>
<p>sin (7:7)? Paul emphatically rejects that equation, emphasizing the good-</p>
<p>ness of the law (7:12, 14). e problem is not the law, but the esh’s inabil-</p>
<p>ity to fulll it (7:5, 14, 18, 25; 8:3–8). e law’s role is to identify sin, and in </p>
<p>7:7 Paul oers as a key example the one commandment in the decalogue </p>
<p>that species motives: “you shall not covet.”</p>

<p>9. Despite the rst object of the prohibition in Exod 20:17 and the most prominent </p>
<p>temptation for an adolescent (cf. Rom 7:9), the designation of “covet” is not exclusively </p>
