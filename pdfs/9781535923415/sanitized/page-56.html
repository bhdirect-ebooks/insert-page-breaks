<p>Romans 1:16–17</p>

<p>acknowledgment. Genuine dependence on Christ invites genuine loyalty </p>
<p>to him, not simply reciting a statement about him as if nothing is truly at </p>
<p>stake.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>As in the rest of Romans, Paul now turns to Scripture to demonstrate </p>
<p>a controversial point, using a familiar early Jewish and Christian citation </p>
<p>formula.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>Paul here cites Hab 2:4, which concerns God preserving the</p>
<p>righteous in the time of impending judgment. Some interpreters take </p>
<p>“righteous one” here as Jesus (cf. Acts 3:14; 7:52), but none of the other </p>
<p>sixteen uses of dikaios (“righteous”) in Pauline literature in context refer </p>
<p>to Jesus (including in the quotation of this same passage in Gal 3:11).</p>
<p>Scholars also debate whose faith(fulness) is in view in this Habakkuk </p>
<p>quotation. Although the dominant Greek version of Hab 2:4 says, “my </p>
<p>[God’s] faith [pistis],” Paul undoubtedly knows that the Hebrew speaks </p>
<p>of the faith of the righteous person; Paul simply omits the debatable pro-</p>
<p>noun. Scholars have taken him in one or both ways here; Paul does speak </p>
<p>later of God’s faithfulness (pistis, 3:3). Yet it would have been easy for him </p>
<p>to have followed the Greek rendering familiar to his audience, which he </p>
<p>chooses not to do,</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>and in Romans he far more oen speaks of believers’</p>
<p>pistis (e.g., 1:8, 12), even when echoing the text here (4:5). Elsewhere (Gal </p>
<p>3:6, 11) Paul midrashically links the two biblical texts that mention both </p>
<p>righteousness and faith, and the other text clearly refers to a believer’s </p>
<p>(Abraham’s) faith (Gen 15:6). us Paul probably refers to the believer’s </p>
<p>faith here.</p>
<p>Like some other Pharisaic interpreters,</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>Paul presumably applies</p>
<p>“live” to eternal life, the resurrection life of the coming age (2:7; 5:21; </p>
<p>6:22–23; 8:13; 10:5; 14:9), even though in a sense believers have already </p>
<p>entered it (6:10–13; 8:2, 6). us Paul presumably here cites Habakkuk to </p>
<p>arm that God preserves from his wrath those who trust in him.</p>
<p>54. Scholars debate whether “faith” here attaches to “live” or to “righteous”; normally </p>
<p>in Romans Paul connects faith with righteousness (3:22, 26, 28, 30; 4:3, 5, 9, 11, 13; 5:1; </p>
<p>9:30; 10:4, 6, 10), though in any case all three terms are closely connected here.</p>
<p>55. Cf. e.g., 2 Chron 23:18; 1QS 5.15, 17; CD 5.1; 7.10; 11.18, 20. On Paul and ancient </p>
<p>citation techniques, including adaptation of wording to t the context, see especially </p>
<p>Stanley 1992 passim.</p>
<p>56. Some think that Paul alludes to both the Greek and Hebrew versions, but his </p>
<p>audience likely was unacquainted with the Hebrew version.</p>
