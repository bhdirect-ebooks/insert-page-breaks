<p>one another (the heart of the law, 13:8–10). ose not attached to kosher </p>
<p>laws must stop looking down on believers who keep them (14:1—15:7). </p>
Framing his concern with division over food and holy days in 14:1–23,
<p>he calls believers to welcome one another (14:1–2; 15:7), then biblically </p>
<p>grounds his exhortation to Jews and Gentiles uniting for God (15:8–12). </p>
<p>Paul oers both Jesus (15:7–12) and himself (15:16–29) as examples of </p>
<p>Jews who ministered to Gentiles, and speaks of Gentile believers’ extraor-</p>
<p>dinary debt to Jewish believers (15:26–27). His likely nal closing exhor-</p>
tation warns against those who cause division (16:17).
<p>e Roman situation invited Paul to articulate the sort of message he </p>
<p>oen preached that was relevant for Jew and Gentile alike (1:16; 10:12), </p>
<p>and hence invited unity in Christ’s church.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> (Paul’s own setting sug-</p>
<p>gests that such implications were on his mind for additional reasons; see </p>
<p>15:25–27, 31.) In practical terms (highlighted in ch. 14), such unity would </p>
<p>require a common understanding of the law that provided obedience to </p>
<p>its spirit without constraining Gentiles to adopt its Israelite-specic de-</p>
<p>tails (cf. 2:14, 29; 3:27, 31; 8:2–4; 13:8–10).</p>
<p>Indeed, Paul clinches this point toward the conclusion of his argu-</p>
<p>ment in the letter body. Aer using Scripture to argue his case throughout </p>
<p>the body of the letter, he concludes that Scripture was meant to sustain </p>
<p>hope through “endurance” (nrsv “steadfastness”) and “encouragement” </p>
<p>(15:4). Based on what he has sought to provide them from Scripture, Paul </p>
<p>prays that God will give them the same mind toward one another (15:5). </p>
<p>at is, Paul’s exhortations from Scripture throughout this letter have </p>
<p>been to bring them to unity.</p>
<p>An inductive reading of the situation that Romans seems to address </p>
<p>thus ts well with what we independently know of the situation. Modern </p>
<p>scholars are not the rst to notice this situation; Origen, for example, </p>
<p>recalls that Priscilla and Aquila le due to the decree and presumably re-</p>
<p>turned in its aermath,</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>and explicitly recognizes that in this letter Paul</p>
<p>arbitrates between Jewish and Gentile believers.</p>

<p>Later, when Paul visits</p>
<p>26. Because the Jewish-Gentile barrier was one established in Scripture itself, Paul’s </p>
<p>emphasis on ethnic unity would have even greater implications for any other ethnic di-</p>
<p>visions (e.g., Keener 2003c: esp. 208–10); it has also been applied against nationalism </p>
<p>(e.g., Schlatter 1995: 31, in the context of rising German nationalism) and ethnocentric </p>
<p>imperialism (Jewett cites South African Bishop John William Colenso in 1863).</p>
