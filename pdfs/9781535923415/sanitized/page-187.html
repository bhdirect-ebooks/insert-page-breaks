<p>Excursus: Ancient Mediterranean Food Customs</p>
<p>Besides Jews, some other peoples in the East also avoided pork, including </p>
<p>Phoenicians (Herodian History 5.6.6), perhaps some Syrians (Lucian Syr. d. </p>
<p>54), and Egyptian priests.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> Some other cults,</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> peoples,</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>or sects (especially</p>
<p>the vegetarian Pythagoreans)</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>also had special food customs. Some of these</p>
<p>groups inﬂuenced other persons not belonging to their group.</p>
<p>Most Jewish people maintained their ancestral food customs. Because </p>
<p>of severe persecution for this practice in the Maccabean period, Jewish food </p>
<p>customs had become a signiﬁcant distinctive of Jewish ethnicity.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Gentiles</p>
<p>knew that Jews avoided pork and widely mocked them for it;</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Juvenal, for</p>
<p>example, complained that Jews saw no difference between eating pork and </p>
<p>cannibalism (Sat. 14.98–99). Most Diaspora Jews observed food laws;</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>other</p>
<p>peoples would hardly have ridiculed Jews for this practice otherwise. What </p>
<p>God ordained to separate Israel from the world (Lev 11:44–45) had proved </p>
<p>effective, but Paul saw the emphasis now on mission rather than cultural </p>
<p>separation (though he insisted on maintaining purity in sexual and theological </p>
<p>areas).</p>

<p>Josephus Ag. Ap. 2.141; Lewis 1983: 131; ANET2 10. Earlier, Hittites treated pigs as un-</p>
<p>clean (ANET2 209; Moyer 1983: 29; idem 1969: 106).</p>
<p>3. E.g., Athenaeus Deipn. 10.422D; PGM 4.52–55; Apuleius Metam. 11.21; Plutarch </p>
<p>Isis 2, Mor. 351F.</p>
<p>4. E.g., Britons (Caesar Bell. gall. 5.12); Romans (Plutarch Quaest. rom. 21, Mor. </p>
<p>268E); Libyans (Sextus Empiricus Pyr. 3.223); Egyptians (Plutarch Isis 7, Mor. 353C); </p>
<p>Syrians (Diodorus Siculus 2.4.3; Artemidorus Daldianus Onir. 1.8); Indians (Herodotus </p>
<p>Hist. 3.100); and others.</p>
<p>5. Diodorus Siculus 10.6.1; Plutarch De esu 1.1, Mor. 993A; Lucian Vit. auct. 6; </p>
<p>idem Gall. 4–5, 18; Philostratus Vit. Apoll. 1.1, 8, 21; 6.10–11; 8.5, 7; Ep. Apoll. 8, 43, 84; </p>
<p>Iamblichus V. P. 3.13 (avoiding also wine); 16.68–69; 24.106–9; 30.186; Diogenes Laertius </p>
<p>8.1.12–13, 19, 24. Some others also taught vegetarianism (Edwards and Reasoner 2000: </p>
<p>1015; Ovid Metam. 15.72–73, 75–110, 453–78; Orphics in Linforth 1941: 263; Guthrie </p>
<p>1966: 16–17, 197, 201), at least as a preference (Musonius Rufus 18A, p. 112.19–23).</p>
<p>6. See e.g., Holmén 2001: 224–25; Dunn 1988: 800.</p>
<p>7. E.g., Epictetus Disc. 1.22.4; Plutarch Quaest. conv. 4.4.4, Mor. 669C; Juvenal Sat. </p>
<p>6.160; cf. Josephus Ant. 2.137; Leary 1993; Leon 1960: 39.</p>
<p>8. So Josephus Ag. Ap. 2.282; see also evidence in Trebilco 1991: 18 (though conser-</p>
<p>vative Judeans were oen suspicious, t. ‘Abod. Zar. 4:6).</p>
