<p>God is powerful to “establish” you </p>

<p>“my gospel” (2:16); Paul serves the </p>
<p>gospel (1:1, 9, 16; 15:16, 19–20; cf. </p>
<p>10:15–16) and wants to share it with </p>
<p>them (1:15)</p>
<p>“Preaching” of Jesus Christ (16:25) Preaching (10:8, 14–15)</p>

<p>(phaneroō) from the Scriptures of </p>
<p>the prophets (16:26)</p>
<p>God’s righteousness is now </p>

<p>Paul’s frequent concern for God’s honor and name in this letter</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> cli-</p>
<p>maxes in a nal praise to God</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>for the wise way he has arranged history</p>
<p>so that Gentiles as well as Jews may come to obey Israel’s God through </p>
<p>faith in Jesus the Messiah. In this doxology, on some points more obvi-</p>
<p>ously than in 1:16–17, Paul ties together some of the main themes that </p>
<p>bind this renowned letter together.</p>
<p>47. See especially this emphasis in Schreiner 1998: passim.</p>
<p>48. “Glory to God” was an appropriate praise, including at a work’s ending (4 Macc </p>
<p>18:23; Jude 25). On God alone as wise, see e.g., Sir 1:8. Although readers’ marks of agree-</p>
<p>ment could be interpolated into texts (Maximus of Tyre Or. 16.3; 27.1), “amen” was a </p>
<p>natural close to praises (3 Macc 7:33) and some books (Tob 14:15; 3 Bar. 17:4; 2 En. </p>
<p>68:7).</p>
