<p>Israel’s Role and Salvation</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>claries the sense of the statement in any case. Israel failed to attain the </p>
<p>law of righteousness because they pursued it by works rather than by faith </p>
<p>(9:31–32); Gentiles conversely attained righteousness by faith (9:30). e </p>
<p>problem thus is not the law, but the wrong approach to the law (as Paul </p>
<p>will further clarify in 10:5–8). Like faith (3:31), Christ is the goal of the </p>
<p>law, what the law points to for those with the perspective of faith. But if </p>
<p>the law is approached as a “law of works” (3:27), as in 10:5, recognizing </p>
<p>the reality of Christ should nish o that approach; those who “believe” </p>
<p>(10:4) will not take this approach.</p>
<p>Paul supports his argument exegetically in 10:5–8. Israel’s wrong-</p>
<p>headed approach to the law was by works rather than by faith (9:31–32). </p>
<p>In 10:5 Paul oers a basic text for this wrong approach of works, and in </p>
<p>10:6–8 he counters with a text for the right approach of faith. (Jewish </p>
<p>teachers oen defended positions by citing counter-texts to refute what </p>
<p>they viewed as a misunderstanding of other texts.)</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>We do in fact know</p>
<p>that later Jewish teachers applied texts like those in 10:5 (especially Lev </p>
<p>18:5; also Gal 3:12) to eternal life,</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>even though these passages originally</p>
<p>meant just long life in the land,</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> and it is entirely possible and even prob-</p>
<p>able that Paul has heard this prooext in his debates in the synagogues. </p>
<p>Paul does not need to elaborate on why the approach to the law in 10:5 </p>
<p>is unworkable, because he has already addressed the failure of law-works </p>
<p>due to human sinfulness in 3:10–18 and elsewhere, most recently in </p>
<p>9:31–32 (cf. also 3:21; 4:13; Gal 2:21; 3:21; Phil 3:6, 9).</p>
<p>Paul articulates his own case for righteousness in 10:6–10. Instead of </p>
<p>the righteousness based on works of the law, Paul advocates righteousness </p>
<p>by depending on God’s righteousness (9:30–32; 10:3). Paul adapts the </p>
<p>wording of his chief passage (“lest you say”) to “Do not say in your heart,” </p>
<p>a small change but one that manages to incorporate Deut 9:4, which ex-</p>
<p>plicitly reminds Israel that God is not giving them the land because of </p>
<p>2. Sometimes they even temporarily came down to the level of their erroneous inter-</p>
<p>locutors (e.g. Daube 1960: 54). Comparing one’s argument with that of an opponent was </p>
<p>common (Anderson 2000: 22). “Righteousness-by-faith” speaking (as if human) here is </p>
<p>personication and prosopopoiia, familiar rhetorical devices.</p>
<p>3. See comment on Rom 1:17; also Gathercole 2002: 100–102 (on CD 3.14–16, 20); </p>
<p>Evans 2005: 226. Other texts make the connection between obedience and life (e.g., Neh </p>
<p>9:29; Ezek 20:11–13, 21; 33:12–19), probably echoing Lev 18:5; it might reect court </p>
<p>idiom (Gen 42:18).</p>
<p>4. Cf. Deut 4:1, 26, 40; 5:33; 8:1; 16:20; 30:16, 20.</p>
