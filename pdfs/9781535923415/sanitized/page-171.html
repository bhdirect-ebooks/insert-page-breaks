<p>Living the Christian Life</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>each member has a role. God has distributed to each a measure of faith </p>
<p>(Rom 12:3). is observation refers not to a given amount of faith but </p>
<p>rather faith for a given ministry in the body (12:6–8).</p>
<p>In 12:4–5 members belong not only to Christ (cf. 8:9) but to one </p>
<p>another, each making their own distinctive contributions (as gis) to the </p>
<p>body. When Paul speaks of believers as members of Christ’s body, hence </p>
<p>of one another (12:4–5),</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>he is continuing the line of thought introduced</p>
<p>in 12:1–3. Believers’ renewed minds discern God’s will about how to </p>
<p>devote their bodies to God’s service by building up Christ’s body in the </p>
<p>various ways that God has made each one capable (12:6–8). Ancient in-</p>
<p>tellectuals commonly used the image of the body for both the cosmos</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and the state</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>to indicate a sort of organic unity. Whereas some used the</p>
<p>image for the state to reinforce hierarchy, Paul uses it to emphasize the </p>
<p>complementarity of all members, while also continuing the image’s usual </p>
<p>connotation of unity.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>As elsewhere (1 Cor 12:12–27; cf. Eph 4:4–13), Paul employs the im-</p>
age of the body’s members to emphasize the diversity of ministries with
<p>which God has graced dierent believers (12:6–8). Paul has just spoken </p>
<p>of God providing gracious gis (11:29, regarding Israel); now he speaks </p>
<p>of God’s “grace” (charis) as a sort of empowerment expressed in “grace-</p>
<p>giings” (charismata; cf. also 1 Pet 4:10–11). Believers each receive grace </p>
<p>for dierent ministries (12:6),</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>just as Paul’s ministry to them involved</p>
<p>the grace given him (12:3). Elsewhere we learn that believers might seek </p>
<p>from God gis they believe will edify the body (1 Cor 12:31; 14:1, 12). </p>
<p>11. Intimate unity or friendship with one another is sometimes expressed in terms of </p>
<p>identity (Cicero De or. 31.110; Diodorus Siculus 17.37.6; Philostratus Hrk. 48.22).</p>
<p>12. Mainly Stoics (Seneca Lucil. 95.52; Epictetus Disc. 1.12.26; Marcus Aurelius Med. </p>
<p>7.13).</p>
<p>13. First attributed to Menenius Agrippa (Dionysius of Halicarnassus Ant. rom. </p>
<p>6.86.1–5; Livy 2.32.9–12; Plutarch Cor. 6.2–4; Dio Cassius 4.17.10–13), but oen used </p>
<p>subsequently (Sallust Rep. 10.6; Cicero Rep. 3.25.37; idem Phil. 8.5.15; cf. Aristotle Eth. </p>
<p>nic. 1.7; T. Naph. 2:9–10).</p>
<p>14. Ancient writers sometimes used the image of the body apart from or together </p>
<p>with its “head,” just as Paul also can use these images separately or together (1 Cor 11:3; </p>
<p>12:12; cf. Eph 1:22–23; Col 1:18; 2:19).</p>
<p>15. Greek tradition also recognized that “God” gave dierent enablements to dif-</p>
ferent individuals (Homer Il. 13.730–34; for animals, cf. Phaedrus 3.18.10–15); special
<p>human abilities were also attributed to the benevolence of other deities (e.g., Xenophon </p>
<p>Cyn. 13.18; Aelius Aristides Defense of Oratory 397, §135D). On dierent abilities, see </p>
<p>also Aristotle Pol. 3.7.2–3, 1282b (though in support of hierarchy).</p>
