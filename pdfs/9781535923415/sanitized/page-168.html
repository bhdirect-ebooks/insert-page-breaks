<p>Romans 12</p>
<p>Living the Christian Life (12:1—15:13)</p>
<p>As in some other letters (Gal 5–6; Col 3–4), Paul addresses specic, prac-</p>
<p>tical questions in the church more directly aer laying the theological </p>
<p>groundwork that demands such behavior (thus his “therefore” in 12:1). If </p>
<p>much of Paul’s letter addresses the means of righteousness, 12:1—15:13 </p>
<p>exemplies what righteousness should look like in relationships. In the </p>
<p>specic context of Israel (chs. 9–11), the issue of Jewish-Gentile relation-</p>
<p>ships in Christ’s body remains a central concern (especially obvious in </p>
<p>14:1—15:13). Teaching about serving one another (12:9–21) and the </p>
<p>heart of the law as love for one another (13:8–10) provides the practical </p>
<p>principles that connect Paul’s emphasis on God’s desire to form a people </p>
<p>of both Jews and Gentiles (chs. 1–11, esp. 9–11) with the specic tensions </p>
<p>the Roman congregations are facing (14:1—15:7).</p>
<p>Consider How to Serve One Another (12:1–8)</p>
<p>Paul follows his praise of God’s wisdom (11:33–36) with a summons to </p>
<p>his audience to worship, wherein they are living sacrices. e appeal on </p>
<p>the basis of God’s “compassion”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>in 12:1 evokes what Paul has just said</p>
<p>about his mercy for Jews and Gentiles alike (11:30–32); both alike should </p>
<p>respond with worship (12:1; 15:9–11) as one body (12:4–5). Because of </p>
<p>its key function in applying Paul’s argument in chapters 9–11, plus the </p>
<p>allusions to these verses at the strategic juncture of 15:15–16, I must grant </p>
<p>12:1–3 more space than I allot to many passages.</p>
<p>Paul exhorts believers to present their bodies as living sacrices </p>
<p>(12:1).</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Paul has already urged believers to “present” their bodies as slaves</p>
<p>1. Speakers and authors oen swore or urged hearers “by” a deity (cf. deēsis in Rowe </p>
<p>1997: 139; e.g., Isaeus Menecles 47).</p>
<p>2. On spiritual sacrices, see e.g., Pss 50:14, 16, 23; 51:16–17, 19; 69:30–31; Hos 6:6; </p>
