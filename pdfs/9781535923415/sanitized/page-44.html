<p>Romans 1</p>
<p>Introduction (1:1–17)</p>
<p>e letter’s title matches the titles of other Pauline letters, naming the </p>
<p>recipients (specied here in 1:7). e need for a title stems from the time </p>
<p>that Christians later collected Paul’s letters; otherwise the title might have </p>
<p>been borrowed directly from Paul’s probable statement of purpose in </p>
<p>1:16–17.</p>

<p>Paul’s Greeting (1:1–7)</p>
<p>Just as today’s letters oen open with “Dear” (and e-mails with “Hi”), </p>
<p>ancient letters followed particular conventions. e writer could begin </p>
<p>by identifying him- or her-self, then the addressee, and nally giving </p>
<p>the conventional greeting. Although such introductions were typically </p>
<p>simple,</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> writers could expand any of these elements as needed.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Because</p>
<p>Paul here is writing to a congregation he has not visited, he may expand </p>
<p>the rst element (his identity) at greater length than usual. But introduc-</p>
<p>tions (whether of speeches, laws, books, or other works) typically intro-</p>
<p>duced a work’s primary themes,</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>and Paul hints at some of these even in</p>
<p>1. For purpose statements as titles, see Porphyry Ar. Cat. 57.15–19. Because 1:16–17 </p>
<p>is not explicit that it so functions, however, ancient commentators (in contrast to modern </p>
<p>ones) do not seem to have identied it as such.</p>
<p>2. Weima 2000: 328; Aune 1987: 163. is is true even when orators write the letters </p>
<p>(e.g., Seneca Controv. 2.pref. intro).</p>
<p>3. See Stowers 1986: 20–21, 66. Paul’s expansions reect rhetorical interest (Anderson </p>
<p>1999: 113) and are unusual (Anderson 1999: 207 n. 45); for connections to the letter </p>
<p>body, cf. Wuellner 1976: 335.</p>
<p>4. See e.g., Rhet. Alex. 29, 1436a, lines 33–39; Dionysius of Halicarnassus Lys. 24; </p>
<p>Seneca Controv. 1.pref.21; Quintilian Inst. 4.1.35. Outside speeches, see e.g., Polybius </p>
<p>3.1.3—3.5.9; 11.1.4–5; Dionysius of Halicarnassus uc. 19; Virgil Aen. 1.1–6; Aulus </p>
<p>Gellius Noct. att. pref. 25.</p>
