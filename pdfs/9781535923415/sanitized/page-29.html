<p>Introduction</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>public life (politics, speeches in the courts, and so forth). Although only </p>
<p>a small minority of people had advanced training of any kind, rhetoric </p>
<p>pervaded society and shaped the way urban people thought and argued. </p>
<p>Not only could passersby listen to speakers practicing in the marketplace, </p>
<p>but oratory dominated civic assemblies and was even the subject of some </p>
<p>public competitions.</p>
<p>Because such oratorical training became even more dominant in the </p>
<p>second century, church fathers oen read Paul in light of rhetoric, and </p>
<p>Renaissance and Reformation interpreters like Melanchthon continued </p>
<p>this practice. By the higher rhetorical standards of the second century, </p>
<p>Paul was not an expert rhetorician, but he probably fared better by the </p>
<p>standards of his era. Despite objections to his delivery (cf. 1 Cor 2:3; 2 Cor </p>
<p>10:10; 11:6), Paul’s letters include numerous rhetorical devices that would </p>
<p>have been familiar to his contemporaries. In fact, Paul might have over-</p>
<p>compensated to silence his critics; rhetoricians (such as Cicero) tended </p>
<p>to limit rhetorical devices in letters, which were intended to be more like </p>
<p>conversation than public speech.</p>
<p>Where scholars have overplayed rhetoric is in seeking to structure </p>
<p>Paul’s letters as if they were speeches. Rhetorical handbooks in this period </p>
<p>do not address letters, but when they later do, they do not treat them like </p>
<p>speeches. Most genuine speeches do not t the precise outlines we nd </p>
<p>in rhetorical handbooks, and we should expect such outlines to prove </p>
<p>even less relevant to letters. ey do not even t the letters of rhetorically </p>
<p>sophisticated letter writers like Cicero, Pliny, or Fronto.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Paul’s extant letters are not normal letters (though </p>
<p>they are comparable in some ways to some letter-essays, e.g., by Seneca).</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While Paul oen includes conversational elements, many of his letters </p>
<p>include substantial argumentation—which was characteristically the do-</p>
<p>main of rhetoric rather than of letters. While rhetoric may rarely provide </p>
<p>us detailed outlines for his letters, therefore, it does provide abundant </p>
<p>insights into how Paul argues his case.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Scholars dier as to whether Paul had any rhetorical training or sim-</p>
<p>ply absorbed practices dominant in his environment.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Certainly Paul did</p>
<p>4. e comparison is limited; see Elliott 2008: 17.</p>
<p>5. For some recent nuanced discussions of Paul and rhetoric, see e.g., Porter 1997: </p>
<p>561–67, 584–85; Reed 1997: 182–91; Anderson 1999: 114–26, 280–81; Bird 2008; Keener </p>
<p>2008b: 221.</p>
<p>6. For Paul having more training than many suppose, see Hock 2003.</p>
