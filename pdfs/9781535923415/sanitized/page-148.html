<p>Romans 9:6–29</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>from Hos 1:10 into Isa 10:22 to bridge the connection.)</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Clearly the text</p>
<p>from Isaiah refers to God judging Israel so that only a remnant would be </p>
<p>delivered (by depending on God, Isa 10:20). Elaborating further Isaiah’s </p>
<p>remnant theology in Rom 9:29, Paul cites Isa 1:9, which speaks of Israel </p>
<p>having few survivors—and being treated nearly as harshly as wicked </p>
<p>Gentiles!</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>(In context Isaiah went on to compare them precisely with</p>
<p>such wicked Gentiles, in 1:10, and to point out that their religion was </p>
<p>empty before him because devoid of justice, 1:11–23.) Paul applies the </p>
<p>same principle of God’s activity to the present: when Israel was disobedi-</p>
<p>ent, only a remnant would be delivered. Oen in the ot, Israel as a whole </p>
<p>was in apostasy, with only a remnant saved; for Paul, that made sense </p>
<p>of Israel as a whole not being saved in his generation (though a future </p>
<p>generation of Israel would be, 11:26–27).</p>
<p>Two Approaches to the Law and Righteousness (9:30—10:10)</p>
<p>In 9:30—10:10 Paul presents two approaches to the law and righteous-</p>
<p>ness, but he believes that only one (the way of faith) can genuinely </p>
<p>save sinful people of esh. Based on the foregoing scriptural argument </p>
<p>(that God does not save based on membership in ethnic Israel), Paul in </p>
<p>9:30–33 addresses the reason for Israel’s failure to be saved. He has argued </p>
<p>that Gentiles could be saved and Jews could be unsaved (9:30–31)—one </p>
<p>cannot predict salvation based on ethnicity. How did God make Gentiles </p>
<p>right? By their dependence on his mercy, i.e., by their faith, rather than </p>
<p>by their seeking to become right (9:30). By contrast, Israel, seeking righ-</p>
<p>teousness through the law, could not fulll the law (9:31) because they ap-</p>
<p>proached the law the wrong way, as a standard rather than an invitation to </p>
<p>depend on God’s kindness (9:32). If Jewish people ever prided themselves </p>
<p>in keeping the law, this would be especially true in a context like this one </p>
<p>that notes their view of “ungodly” Gentiles (who neither received the law </p>
<p>20. Jews and Gentiles alike commonly adjusted the wording of texts to t the new </p>
<p>contexts where they were being quoted. Actually conating texts could stem from oral </p>
<p>memory or more likely in this case part of Paul’s rhetorical strategy; on conation in </p>
<p>antiquity, see Stanley 1992: 290–91, 322, 337, 342, 349. e rhetorical suntelōn and </p>
<p>suntemnōn already appeared in the Greek version of Isaiah.</p>
<p>21. Disobedient Israel is compared with Sodom in the prophets (e.g., Isa 3:9; Jer </p>
<p>23:14; Ezek 16:46–56); early Jewish sources continued to use it as an example of im-</p>
<p>morality (Jub. 36:10; 3 Macc 2:5; t. Sanh. 13:8; Shab. 7:23; Sipra Behuq. par. 2.264.1.3; </p>
<p>Sipre Deut. 43.3.5).</p>
