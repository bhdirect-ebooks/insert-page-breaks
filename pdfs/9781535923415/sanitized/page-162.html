<p>Romans 11:11–24</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>of God’s covenant, while unfaithful Jews could be severed from it.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>Jewish branches with faith could be graed in more naturally than foreign </p>
<p>branches, and Gentile believers who depended on their own ethnicity </p>
<p>rather than on God’s kindness would also be severed.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Fullling the Promise to Israel (11:25–32)</p>
<p>Aer arguing that Jewish believers t in the covenant more readily than </p>
<p>Gentile believers do, Paul articulates his expectation that the Jewish peo-</p>
<p>ple as a whole will someday embrace Jesus as their deliverer, consummat-</p>
<p>ing his covenant with them (11:25–27). Paul’s use of “mystery” (11:25) </p>
<p>ts one common Jewish use of the term, for end-time secrets revealed </p>
<p>to God’s prophets (16:25–26; Dan 2:28–30).</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>is end-time mystery</p>
<p>that Paul reveals is that God had allowed Israel’s hardness for a time just </p>
<p>to allow a massive inux of Gentiles into the covenant, but God would </p>
<p>ultimately remove the hardness and restore Israel to faith (11:25–26; cf. </p>
<p>11:11–12).</p>
<p>Once the fullness of the Gentiles has come in, “all Israel” (Israel as </p>
<p>a whole) will be saved. Some have argued that “Israel” here refers to the </p>
<p>“fullness of the Gentiles,” i.e., the completed Gentile church from among </p>
<p>all nations. But while Paul, like other early Christian writers, certainly re-</p>
<p>gards all believers as part of Israel’s heritage (and has indicated as much in </p>
<p>the graing image in 11:17), he has been consistently contrasting “Israel” </p>
<p>with Gentiles in the context (9:27, 31; 10:19, 21; 11:2, 7; and most impor-</p>
<p>tantly in 11:25). e context also suggests that God will remove Israel’s </p>
<p>hardness when the full measure of Gentile believers (probably represen-</p>
<p>tatives from among the nations, as in Matt 24:14; Rev 5:9; cf. Rom 15:19) </p>
<p>has come in (the likeliest sense of achri, “until,” in 11:25).</p>

<p>2.73–82 (olives); Pliny Nat. 15.15.49; 15.17.57; 17.24.101–14; 17.26.118–22; m. Shevi’it </p>
<p>2:6; Sipra Qed. par. 3.202.1.5.</p>
<p>24. Expressions regarding “nature” were applied in a variety of ways in antiquity; use </p>
<p>in the moral sphere (as in 1:26–27; Cicero Inv. 2.53.161; Musonius Rufus 17, p. 108.7) </p>
<p>is predicated on the larger physical world, but not all physical claims need be intended </p>
<p>morally (e.g., Cicero Tusc. 1.14.31; Aelian Nat. an. 11.26). Nevertheless, that Paul has </p>
<p>employed such language earlier in such strong terms adds rhetorical shock value here, </p>
<p>forcefully warning Gentiles against arrogance.</p>
