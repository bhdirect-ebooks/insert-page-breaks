<p>Fusing the Horizons: Homosexual Activity</p>

<p>dren of their own. Although various Greek sources report its occurrence among </p>
<p>Gauls, Persians (especially with eunuchs), and others, the dominant cultural </p>
<p>inﬂuence for it was Greek. This practice pervaded Greek society and was even </p>
<p>attributed to deities.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>Homosexual practices are attested in Rome from an early period, but </p>
<p>Greek inﬂuence multiplied these practices in Roman society, especially among </p>
<p>the leisured aristocracy. Romans had often denounced these practices as due </p>
<p>to Greek inﬂuence, and some Roman thinkers continued to reject the prac-</p>
<p>tice (see further discussion below), but it was now widely entrenched within </p>
<p>aristocratic Roman society. Paul is thus not simply playing to Roman Gentiles </p>
<p>who opposed the practice because of their cultural backgrounds. Indeed, Paul </p>
<p>writes in Greek to a majority audience of Greek speakers in Rome, probably </p>
<p>most of them immigrants from, or recent descendants of those who had immi-</p>
<p>grated from, the east. Their shared antipathy to homosexual practice is rooted </p>
<p>not primarily in traditional Roman values (although it undoubtedly appealed </p>
<p>to them) but in Jewish beliefs also adopted by Gentile adherents to Judaism </p>
<p>and the early Christian movement.</p>
<p>As in most cultures, particular features of a society are linked with other </p>
<p>characteristics of that society. In the Greek (and to lesser extent, Roman) </p>
<p>world fathers could insist, often for economic reasons, that unwanted babies </p>
<p>be abandoned on trash heaps.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>Although the matter is debated, there is still</p>
<p>reason to believe that Greeks abandoned female babies more often than male </p>
<p>babies, given the disparity in genders and consequent disparity in age at mar-</p>
<p>riage. On average, Greek men seem to have married around age thirty, marry-</p>
<p>ing young women twelve years their junior. This meant that young men in that </p>
<p>society looked for other sexual outlets before marriage: slaves, prostitutes, and </p>
<p>(more affordably) each other. The particular sexual practices dominant varied </p>
<p>from one Greek city-state to another, but in this period the old traditions of </p>
<p>Athens were most inﬂuential.</p>
<p>89. Zeus, for example, seduced and raped not only women, but the boy Ganymede, </p>
<p>whom he eventually took up to heaven (e.g., Homer Il. 20.232–35; Ovid Metam. 10.155–</p>
<p>61); as the satirist Lucian wryly points out, his wife Hera apparently tolerated this boy </p>
<p>on Olympus more than her earthly women rivals (Lucian Dial. d. 213–14 [8/5, Zeus </p>
<p>and Hera]). Other deities also loved boys sexually (e.g., Apollodorus Library 1.3.3; Ovid </p>
<p>Metam. 10.162–219); Josephus ridiculed such portrayals (Ag. Ap. 2.275).</p>
<p>90. e babies so abandoned could be eaten by vultures or dogs, but were oen ad-</p>
<p>opted and raised as slaves. Jews and Egyptians, however, rejected this practice of child </p>
<p>abandonment.</p>
