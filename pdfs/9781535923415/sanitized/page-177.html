<p>and the Lord’s “vengeance” of 12:19 probably points toward ery</p>
<p>judgment here for those who do not repent. Other Pauline uses of “re” </p>
<p>refer to the judgment (1 Cor 3:13, 15; 2 ess 1:8), and burning coals </p>
<p>can stand for judgment in his Bible (2 Sam 22:9, 13; Pss 120:4; 140:10).</p>

<p>Granted, Paul does contrast 12:19 and 12:20 (signied by the strong “but,” </p>
<p>alla, in 12:20); on either reading, acts of kindness in 12:20 provide an al-</p>
<p>ternative to acts of vengeance in 12:19. But while one could overcome evil </p>
<p>with good (12:21) by converting the evil to the good, such an outcome </p>
<p>cannot be guaranteed (cf. 12:18; 1 Cor 7:16). One can, however, overcome </p>
<p>evil by refusing to come down to its moral level, not retaliating in kind, an </p>
<p>approach that ts this context.</p>

<p>orally transmitted sense of the proverb) would not be available to Greek readers in Rome. </p>
<p>For shaming an enemy with kindness, cf. ANET</p>

<p> 422; more useful background (on reap-</p>
<p>plying the language of burning coals) could be Gen. Rab. 50:11 (though Sipre Deut. 45.1.2 </p>
<p>applies the proverb to conquering the evil impulse by doing good).</p>
<p>36. Paul cited Ps 140:3 with reference to the wicked in Rom 3:13; Ps 140:10 refers </p>
<p>to judgment on the wicked. For wrath on heads, see e.g., Ezek 9:10; 22:31; Jdt 9:9. For </p>
<p>various positive readings of the verse, see e.g., Käsemann, Michel, Craneld, Dunn, </p>
<p>Byrne, Jewett; for the much less common negative reading adopted here, see Stendahl, </p>
