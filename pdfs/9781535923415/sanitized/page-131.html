<p>body as involving “glory” (1 Cor 15:40–43; Phil 3:21).</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>It may also imply</p>
<p>the restoration of Adam’s lost glory (3:23; 1 Cor 11:7), i.e., complete res-</p>
<p>toration to God’s image in Christ (Rom 8:29; 1 Cor 15:45–49). As wrath </p>
<p>would be “revealed” to the wicked (2:5), so would glory be “revealed” in </p>
<p>the righteous (cf. Isa 40:5; 1 Pet 4:13; 5:1).</p>
<p>Paul elsewhere speaks of eager longing for events designated for </p>
<p>Christ’s return (8:23, 25; 1 Cor 1:7; Gal 5:5; Phil 3:20). In 8:19, however, </p>
<p>all creation awaits that time; creation has suered since Adam abdicated </p>
<p>his role as God’s vizier and caretaker of creation (cf. 8:20; Gen 1:26–28).</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Creation longs for God’s “children” to be revealed (8:19); in what sense </p>
<p>is this yet to happen? e Spirit testies to believers that they are already </p>
<p>God’s children (8:15–16), but this reality will be consummated when the </p>
<p>Spirit resurrects their bodies (8:11–13). (Rhetorically, Paul includes three </p>
<p>apok- words in 8:19, two of them also including d and k sounds.)</p>
<p>Whether we think that God or Adam “subjected” creation here, </p>
<p>Paul’s earlier emphasis on Adam’s sin probably informs the cosmic eects </p>
<p>of the fall here.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>is is especially likely if “vanity” or “futility” (mataiotēs)</p>
<p>refers back to humanity rebelling against the creator in Rom 1:20–21.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When God’s children are restored, this subjection to vanity will be re-</p>
<p>versed. ough created in God’s image (Gen 1:26–27) to govern the earth </p>
<p>(Gen 1:28), humanity corrupted God’s image through idolatry (Rom </p>
<p>22. In 1 Cor 15:40–41, he evokes the image of heavenly bodies as understood among </p>
<p>his contemporaries (see discussion in Keener 2005b: 131).</p>
<p>23. Although Paul may personify creation here, its label “creation” sancties the </p>
<p>cosmos by relating it to its creator (as Jewett notes) rather than the Gentile approach of </p>
<p>treating earth as “mother” (though Paul does allow it “birth pangs,” 8:22). Stoics spoke of </p>
<p>nature’s “sympathy” or working together (Murray 1915: 43); if Paul uses any element of </p>
<p>the idea, he adapts it to reect God’s sovereignty.</p>
<p>24. Cf. e.g., Gen 3:17; Jub. 3:28; 4 Ezra 7:11–12; Sipre Num. 18.1.1. For God as sub-</p>
<p>jecter (cf. Pauline usage in 1 Cor 15:27–28; Phil 3:21), see e.g., Schreiner; for Adam, e.g., </p>
<p>Talbert; for both, Byrne.</p>
<p>25. e only other use of a cognate in Romans. Since that context involves idolatry </p>
<p>(1:23), a common use of “vanity” in Scripture (e.g., 1 Kgs 16:13, 26; 2 Kgs 17:15; Isa 44:9; </p>
<p>Jer 2:5; 10:3, 15; Jonah 2:8; Wis 13:1; 15:8) and early Jewish sources (3 Macc 6:11; Sib. </p>
<p>Or. 3.29, 547–48, 555), the idea may be that instead of recognizing God’s greatness in </p>
<p>creation (Rom 1:20), fallen humanity worshiped it, making images from it (1:23). With </p>
<p>humanity’s restoration to God’s image in Christ (8:29), creation would also resume its </p>
<p>rightful role. Creation’s “corruption” (phthora, 8:21) might echo the wrong worship of </p>
<p>“perishable” (phthartos, the only other cognate in Romans) created things (1:23).</p>
