<p>Romans 6:1–11</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>in Adam and were raised to a new master, God. ey must view their </p>
<p>identity as those who have died and been raised in Christ, and hence </p>
<p>must live accordingly. Paul is simply demanding belief congruent with </p>
<p>the truth he has explained in 6:2–10: in Christ, believers died to the sin of </p>
<p>Adamic humanity and have new life. If they believe this, they will “walk” </p>
<p>(6:4) accordingly.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>If they can have faith that Jesus rose, having faith that</p>
<p>they share this resurrection life should be a natural corollary. Some an-</p>
<p>cient commentators also recognized this approach. Origen comments, </p>
<p>“Whoever thinks or considers that he is dead will not sin. For example, </p>
<p>if lust for a woman gets hold of me or if greed for silver, gold or riches </p>
<p>stirs me and I say in my heart that I have died with Christ . . . the lust is </p>
<p>immediately quenched and sin disappears.”</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Scholars oen nd in Paul a tension between the indicative and the </p>
<p>imperative; Paul summons them to be what he declares they are. is may </p>
<p>be because for Paul identity is determined by being in Christ, but the be-</p>
<p>liever must still choose to believe the eschatological reality suciently to </p>
<p>live accordingly. rough faith one receives a new identity, and through </p>
<p>faith one must also continue to embrace and live in that new identity, so </p>
<p>that obedient works become expressions of living faith.</p>

<p>Do Not Serve Sin (6:12–23)</p>
<p>Having established that in principle believers are dead to sin, their iden-</p>
<p>tity dened by their union and future with Christ, Paul now exhorts </p>
<p>them to live accordingly. If they are no longer slaves to sin (6:6), then </p>
<p>sin must no longer reign (basileuō) in them (6:12; cf. 5:14, 17, 21) or rule </p>
<p>9. For the eschatological destruction of sin, relevant to believers foretasting resurrec-</p>
<p>tion life in Christ, see e.g., Jer 3:17; 31:32–34; 1QS 4.17–26; 5.5; Jub. 50:5; 1 En. 5:8–9; </p>
<p>91:8–11, 17; 92:5; 107:1; 108:3; Ps. Sol. 17:32; 4 Ezra 7:92; T. Mos. 10:1; T. Zeb. 9:8 (mss); </p>
<p>on the eschatological execution of the evil impulse in later rabbis, see e.g., Pesiq. Rab Kah. </p>
<p>24:17; Pesiq. Rab Kah. Sup. 3:2; b. Sukkah 52a. Evil desire ceases aer death in L.A.B. 33:3.</p>
<p>10. Origen Comm. Rom. on 6:11 (Bray 1998: 162).</p>
<p>11. Engberg-Pedersen 2000: 55, 65, 233, helpfully compares a similar conceptualiza-</p>
<p>tion about belief in Stoicism, though the conceptual pattern may have existed somewhat </p>
<p>more widely (Pindar Pythian Odes 2.72; Pliny Ep. 1.3.5; see comment on Rom 8:1–11), </p>
<p>perhaps even (in a more general way) in Scripture (Rosner 1999: 86–89; cf. Sir 7:16; </p>
<p>Josephus Ant. 3.44–45). Many believed that the mind and correct beliefs could overcome </p>
<p>passion (e.g., Cicero O. 2.5.18; idem Leg. 1.23.60; idem Inv. 2.54.164; Stowers 2001: 92; </p>
<p>4 Macc 1:1, 9); Paul rejects mere human mental power (Rom 7:22–23; 8:6), here stressing </p>
<p>rather faith in Christ and solidarity with him.</p>
