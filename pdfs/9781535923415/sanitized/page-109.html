<p>Life in Christ and the Spirit</p>

<p>(kurieuō) them (6:14; cf. 6:9; 7:1; 14:9). ey must be slaves who obey </p>
<p>God and righteousness rather than sin (6:16–22).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Jesus had preached</p>
<p>the impending reign of God; Paul’s explanation of the new life in Christ </p>
<p>and by the Spirit shows how he believes that God reigns in believers in the </p>
<p>present (cf. 14:9, 17).</p>
<p>In 6:12 Paul warns against following the passions or illicit “desires” </p>
<p>(cf. 1:24; 7:7–8; 13:9, 14) of the body destined for death. Whatever else </p>
<p>“esh” means (see the excursus aer 7:14–25), it has some association </p>
<p>with the body’s susceptibility to following its passions rather than delib-</p>
<p>erate submission to Christ. Bodily members can be used for evil (1:24; </p>
<p>6:6; 7:24; 8:10, 13), but they can also be presented to God’s service (6:13, </p>
<p>19; 12:1), presumably as members of a greater body (7:4; 12:4–5).</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>presenting of bodies to God as his “instruments” (6:13) and slaves (6:16) </p>
<p>could perhaps evoke weapons for battle, a very common meaning of the </p>
<p>term here for “instruments” (hopla; see 13:12; 2 Cor 10:4). Reckoning </p>
<p>themselves new (6:11), believers must no longer view themselves as un-</p>
<p>der death (6:12), but rather, as alive from the dead (6:13).</p>
<p>Paul again shocks the sensibilities of his audience by reversing tra-</p>
<p>ditional expectations. It is those under the law rather than those under </p>
<p>grace who are prone to sin (6:14–15), which he will soon identify with </p>
<p>lawlessness (6:19). ose of us in societies lacking many moral boundar-</p>
<p>ies may appreciate the helpfulness of external laws,</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>but Paul demands an</p>
<p>inner transformation that yields a desire to submit to God’s will (8:5–9).</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One must serve either sin or righteousness (6:16–20). (Paul sometimes </p>
<p>mixes his contrasts, e.g., sin leading to death versus obedience leading </p>
<p>to righteousness in 6:16, but rather than weakening his antitheses Paul is </p>
<p>strengthening the moral dualism established in 5:12–21, with everything </p>
<p>bad on one side of the ledger and everything good on the other.) e </p>
<p>“teaching” they obeyed (6:17) at least includes the gospel (16:17), which </p>
<p>12. e transference of slavery to another master occurred in sacral manumission </p>
<p>(to temples), but Paul probably has the more general slave image in mind. Like slavery </p>
<p>in general (see comment on 6:6), kurieuō could be used for evil (e.g., T. Dan 3:2; 4:7) or </p>
<p>good (Marcus Aurelius Med. 5.26) ruling one.</p>
<p>13. On some philosophers’ warnings about bodily passions, see comment at 7:7–13.</p>
<p>14. Probably even Paul would have also accepted the value of laws for societies (cf. </p>
<p>13:1–7), following the philosophic dictum that the truly wise or righteous were the only </p>
<p>ones who needed no external law (Gal 5:23; cf. 1 Tim 1:9–10).</p>
<p>15. Even if others did not press it as far as Paul, the idea that grace and a God-given </p>
<p>identity generates righteousness should have been intelligible (cf. Wis 15:2–3).</p>
