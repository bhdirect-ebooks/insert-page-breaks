<p>Romans 4</p>
<p>Made Right by Trusting Christ (1:18—5:11), cont.</p>
<p>Abraham Righted by Faith (4:1–8)</p>
<p>Having claimed in 3:31 that the way of faith establishes the teaching of </p>
<p>the law (cf. also 3:21), Paul now goes on to demonstrate this by means </p>
<p>of a midrash on a foundational passage for Israel’s history. Revealing the </p>
<p>biblical foundations for the points that he has just been making, he will </p>
<p>establish that even Abraham could not boast in his works (3:27; 4:2); that </p>
<p>even he was put right with God by trust rather than merit (3:28; 4:3–5); </p>
<p>and that God had a purpose for uncircumcised Gentiles as well as cir-</p>
<p>cumcised Jews (3:29–30; 4:9–12, 16–18).</p>
<p>Abraham was the dening ancestor of Israel (4:1; though not only </p>
<p>of Israel; 9:7–13), so his support for accepting uncircumcised Gentiles </p>
<p>among God’s people would outweigh any other Jewish objections.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Not</p>
<p>only was Abraham the model for Israel,</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>but later rabbis considered him</p>
<p>the model Gentile convert to Judaism and armed his and Sarah’s witness </p>
<p>to Gentiles. ose who appealed to the model of Abraham oen appealed </p>
<p>to his works, with faith among them.</p>
<p>But however much Abraham’s faith was expressed in obedience and </p>
<p>righteousness, it is clear that faith was the foundation for these other </p>
<p>elements. Scripture specically announced that God counted Abram as </p>
<p>righteous when he believed God’s promise (Gen 15:6; quoted in Rom 4:3). </p>
<p>1. Later rabbis also claimed the benets of the patriarchs’ merits (e.g., m. ’Abot 2:2; </p>
<p>Mek. Pisha 16.165–68, with other opinions in 16.169–72; Besh. 4.52–57; Sipra Behuq. pq. </p>
<p>8.269.2.5; Sipre Deut. 8.1.1). We lack space to engage the competing arguments regarding </p>
<p>the syntax of Rom 4:1 (e.g., Hays 1989: 54; idem 2005: 64–73; Gathercole 2002: 234).</p>
<p>2. For Abraham receiving the covenant through obedience, Talbert (2002: 98) cites </p>
<p>Gen 26:2–5; Jub. 15:3–4; Sir 44:19–21; CD 3.2. For a history of early Jewish approaches to </p>
<p>Gen 15:6, see Oeming 1998: 16–33. For why Paul focuses on Abraham rather than Sarah </p>
<p>here, see Grieb 2002: 51.</p>
