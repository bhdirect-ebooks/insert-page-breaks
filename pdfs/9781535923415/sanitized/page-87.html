<p>Made Right by Trusting Christ</p>

<p>teousness likely includes both justice and covenant faithfulness (1:17–18; </p>
<p>3:3–8) we may be able to accommodate both alternatives.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>In light of the foregoing explanation in 3:22–26, then (oun, “there-</p>
<p>fore”; 3:27), self-boasting has no place. One might boast in one’s merit if </p>
<p>one interpreted the goal of the law as works; but instead the law teaches </p>
<p>the way of faith (3:27; cf. 9:31–32), as is clear throughout Paul’s argument </p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>e law attests God’s righteousness, not humanity’s (3:21–23), and</p>
<p>faith establishes the law (3:31). Paul’s message about Jesus in fact draws </p>
<p>on analogies in the law that make this point, such as redemption and </p>
<p>atonement (3:24–25). us, one is righted by depending on God, not by </p>
<p>merit (3:28). (Paul also contrasts approaches to the law in 8:2; 9:31–32; </p>
<p>10:5–8.)</p>
<p>Paul has never lost sight of the reason he is making this case for faith </p>
<p>in Romans: the point that Jew and Gentile must come to God on the same </p>
<p>terms, rather than a Jewish person starting with the advantage of know-</p>
<p>ing the law (3:9, 22). If there is one God—and that was the basic corner-</p>
<p>stone of Judaism (Deut 6:4)</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>—then he must be God for all humanity, not </p>
<p>only for Israel (Rom 3:29–30). Instead of using God’s supremacy to argue </p>
<p>for Israel’s sole (end-time) exaltation, as many of his contemporaries did, </p>
<p>he uses it to argue that God cares about all humanity. Does Paul, how-</p>
<p>ever, envision separate means of righting for these groups, Jews “by” or </p>
<p>“from” faith(fulness) and Gentiles “through” faith(fulness) (3:30)? “By” </p>
<p>and “from” may simply reect stylistic variation, which was important </p>
<p>in rhetoric.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>Paul has already been clear that for both this faith must be</p>
<p>Jesus-faith (3:22), not dependence on law-works (3:19–20). Being God of </p>
<p>all humanity means that God does not care only about those to whom he </p>
<p>gave the Torah.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>38. Paul’s repetition of “demonstrate his righteousness” might be rhetorical reinforce-</p>
<p>ment (by anadiplosis); it is surely rhetorical commitment to maintain the clarity of syntax </p>
<p>(by dilogia). See Anderson 2000: 18, 37; idem 1999: 228.</p>
<p>39. Insofar as “law” translates tora, it can include all of God’s gracious instruction </p>
<p>in Scripture, or focus more narrowly on that instruction in the Pentateuch. Translating </p>
<p>“law” here as “principle” (niv; omitted altogether in nlt), however, ignores the obvious </p>
<p>context (3:19–21, 28, 31), perhaps in favor of theological bias.</p>
<p>40. For its regular recitation, see e.g., m. Ber. 1:1–4; 2:1, 3; Tami d 5:1; and the earlier </p>
<p>Nash papyrus.</p>
<p>41. Cf. Campbell 1992.</p>
<p>42. Some ancient writers did emphasize God as God of all humanity (e.g., Josephus </p>
<p>Ag. Ap. 2.193), but the emphasis on God caring about Gentiles, while present in some </p>
