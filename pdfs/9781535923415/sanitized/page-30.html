<p>not have advanced (tertiary) training in a Greek rhetorical school with </p>
<p>the goal of becoming a Greek orator; orators exhibited their skills by lav-</p>
<p>ishly citing classical Greek texts, which appear in Paul only very rarely. By </p>
<p>contrast, many of Paul’s letters (notably including Romans) lavishly dis-</p>
<p>play the Jewish Scriptures, typically in the forms dominant in the Greek </p>
<p>Diaspora. Paul’s display of biblical knowledge suggests the combination of </p>
<p>a brilliant mind with the best of training in the Scriptures, probably in the </p>
<p>ancient world’s best center for such training, namely Jerusalem. If Paul, </p>
<p>presumably from a well-o family who could aord such training, stud-</p>
<p>ied with Gamaliel in Greek (as suggested in Acts 22:3; cf. t. Sotah 15:8), </p>
<p>he probably also had some additional training in delivering sermons in </p>
<p>acceptable Greek style. Today’s equivalent might be advanced study in </p>
<p>Bible with a few homiletics courses. If so, Paul masterfully developed the </p>
<p>basic skills he received at this level of training.</p>
<p>If Paul used Greek techniques because they were a part of the milieu </p>
<p>in which he and Diaspora Judaism (and to a somewhat reduced extent, </p>
<p>Palestinian Judaism) moved, Paul’s more specically “Jewish” context in-</p>
<p>forms what he would have viewed as the core of his cultural identity (cf. </p>
<p>Rom 9:1–5; 11:1).</p>
<p>Paul, Judaism, and the Law</p>
<p>When we speak of Paul and “Judaism,” we are usually thinking in anach-</p>
<p>ronistic terms. Paul, like most of the earliest Christian movement even in </p>
<p>the Diaspora, was Jewish. Modern Western readers distinguish “Judaism” </p>
<p>and “Christianity” as distinct religions, but the Christian movement, as </p>
<p>it came to be called, viewed itself as carrying on the biblical faith of pa-</p>
<p>triarchs and prophets in view of end-time fulllment in Christ, demon-</p>
<p>strated by the eschatological gi of the Spirit.</p>
<p>As scholars today emphasize, rst-century Judaism was itself highly </p>
diverse; some even speak of “Judaisms” (though emphasizing the wide
<p>variation in Jewish practice should make the point suciently). Its rab-</p>
<p>binic form (which evolved into traditional Orthodox Judaism as we know </p>
<p>it today) evolved from Pharisaism, but that evolution postdates Paul’s </p>
<p>ministry. Paul’s faith is, in a sense, an earlier development of Pharisaism </p>
<p>(albeit a minority one) than rabbinic Judaism is, as some Jewish scholars </p>
<p>have recently pointed out. Jews as a people armed circumcision, the </p>
<p>temple, the Torah, and other traits (many of these, like distinctive food </p>
