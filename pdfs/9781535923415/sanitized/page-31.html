<p>customs, highlighted over the previous two centuries as costly marks </p>
<p>of distinctive Jewish identity). Yet some (more oen in the Holy Land) </p>
<p>expected the imminent end of the age, whereas others denied it. e de-</p>
<p>gree of Jewish Diaspora assimilation to the surrounding culture varied </p>
<p>from one place to another and according to the attitudes of their host </p>
<p>cultures.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Views about messianic gures varied more widely than we have</p>
<p>space to narrate here. Paul has been compared to apocalyptic, mystic, and </p>
<p>Pharisaic streams of Judaism, among others.</p>
<p>E. P. Sanders on “the Law”</p>
<p>e dominant current arguments surrounding Paul’s relationship with </p>
<p>his Jewish context most relevant to Romans, however, involve his own </p>
<p>approach to the law versus that of his contemporaries. Views of Paul’s re-</p>
<p>lationship to what we call Judaism have varied widely over the centuries, </p>
<p>from Marcion’s proto-gnostic Paul (who rejected anything Jewish) to W. </p>
<p>D. Davies’ Paul (who was a Pharisee who believed that the messianic era </p>
<p>had dawned). Most scholars today would agree more with Davies than </p>
<p>Marcion, but some aspects of Paul’s relation to Judaism—and the charac-</p>
<p>ter of ancient Judaism—remain debated.</p>
<p>E. P. Sanders’s work Paul and Palestinian Judaism, published in </p>
<p>1977, shook New Testament scholarship in general and Pauline studies </p>
<p>in particular. Many New Testament scholars (particularly in the German </p>
<p>scholarly tradition—at least according to Anglophone scholars), de-</p>
<p>picted Judaism as legalistic and seeking to be justied by works. (is </p>
<p>grid for reading the sources persisted from debates at the time of the </p>
<p>Reformation.) Scholars of Judaism had long challenged the suciency of </p>
<p>such a paradigm (which pervaded works like Strack-Billerbeck’s widely-</p>
<p>used rabbinic commentary on the New Testament),</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>but it was Sanders’s</p>
<p>forceful polemic that shook the old paradigm. He argued that nearly all of </p>
<p>ancient Judaism armed that Israelites as a whole were graciously chosen </p>
<p>as part of the covenant, and remained members of the covenant unless </p>
<p>7. For one typology regarding assimilation, accommodation, and acculturation, see </p>
<p>Barclay 1995.</p>
<p>8. Earlier scholars with more nuanced views include Moore (1971) and Bonsirven </p>
<p>(1964); in Pauline scholarship, Longenecker (1976) also showed analogies in a covenant </p>
<p>nomist pattern in Paul’s and other early Jewish thought.</p>
