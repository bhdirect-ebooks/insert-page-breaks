<p>Made Right by Trusting Christ</p>

<p>Once they had perverted God’s image directly, they distorted it also </p>
<p>in themselves. God’s image in humanity included the complementar-</p>
<p>ity of male and female (Gen 1:27),</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>and the distortion of his image led</p>
<p>to same-sex intercourse against “nature,” which for Paul meant against </p>
<p>the way God had created humans to function. (at Paul has Genesis </p>
<p>in mind is made likelier by the distinctive terms he employs for “male” </p>
<p>and “female” in Rom 1:26–27, terms that appear together prominently in </p>
<p>Genesis, though not exclusively; cf. Gen 1:27; 5:2; Mark 10:6.) Possibly </p>
<p>the penalty “in themselves” (1:27) involved not only the physical conse-</p>
<p>quences of their behavior but the further eacing of God’s character and </p>
<p>image in them (cf. 1:19, 24; contrast 8:23). Greek myths portrayed their </p>
<p>deities committing all kinds of immorality, including sexual immorality,</p>
<p>85</p>
<p> </p>
<p>behavior that Jewish apologists connected with Greek male lifestyles and </p>
<p>oen ridiculed.</p>

<p>Fusing the Horizons: Homosexual Activity</p>
Scholars diverge fairly widely in their views about how to interpret Paul in
<p>1:26–27, although a majority recognizes that Paul condemns homosexual be-</p>
<p>havior generally. Interpreters differ still more widely over how (and whether) to </p>
<p>apply Paul today. In view of this disparity, we need to understand the historical </p>
<p>context of Paul’s argument.</p>
<p>Homosexual Activity in Antiquity</p>
<p>Homosexual activity was common in the ancient Mediterranean world.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>It</p>
<p>was usually bisexual rather than exclusively homosexual.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>Most of those who</p>
<p>courted or molested boys planned to eventually marry women and have chil-</p>
<p>84. is complementarity was especially sexual, designed for procreation (Gen </p>
<p>1:28).</p>
<p>85. E.g., Pliny Nat. 2.5.17; Lucian Prom. 17; Deor. conc. 7; Philops. 2.</p>
<p>86. Josephus Ag. Ap. 2.232–49, 275; cf. later Athenagoras 20–22; eophilus 1.9; </p>
<p>Tati an 33–34.</p>
<p>87. For discussions, see e.g., Dover 1978; Greenberg 1988. On Paul’s view, see con-</p>
<p>trary arguments in e.g., Scroggs 1983; Gagnon 2001.</p>
<p>88. e latter practice did exist, although it was sometimes stereotypically associated </p>
<p>with misogyny.</p>
