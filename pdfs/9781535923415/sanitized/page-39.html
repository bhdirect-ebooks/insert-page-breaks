<p>adherents of the synagogue) may have held the “Jewish” position, and </p>
<p>some especially culturally sensitive Jews (probably including Aquila and </p>
<p>Priscilla) may not have insisted on Gentiles observing the whole law, but </p>
<p>at least two basic “sides” seem to have existed nonetheless.</p>
<p>Jews and Gentiles in Paul’s Letter</p>
<p>Committed to building up the believers in Rome (Rom 1:11), Paul natu-</p>
<p>rally targets a key issue among them. His letter addresses the relationship </p>
<p>between Jewish and Gentile believers (1:16; 2:9-10; 3:9; 9:24; 10:12).</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>Romans 1–3, he establishes everyone’s equal need before God: not only </p>
<p>Gentiles (1:18–32) but also Jews (2:1—3:20) are damned. He shows how </p>
<p>the law itself need not make Jews better than Gentiles (e.g., 2:14). He </p>
<p>shows how the law itself establishes righteousness by faith (3:21, 27, 31), </p>
<p>focusing on the example of Abraham (ch. 4). Against Jewish dependence </p>
<p>on their corporate chosenness in Abraham, Paul shows that it is those </p>
<p>who are of faith who are Abraham’s spiritual heirs (4:11–16), and reminds </p>
<p>those inclined to depend on genetic ancestry that all are descended from </p>
<p>Adam (5:12–21). e way of faith makes people more righteous, not less </p>
<p>(6:1—8:13). Possessing the law does not make Jewish people righteous </p>
<p>(ch. 7), and all believers share in a new experience of redemption akin to </p>
<p>the promised new exodus (ch. 8). Jewish people believed that they were </p>
<p>chosen in Abraham, but Paul shows that God’s sovereignty means that </p>
<p>chosenness for salvation need not rest on ethnicity (ch. 9, especially vv. </p>
<p>6–13).</p>
<p>Having established that Gentiles and those who do not observe </p>
<p>ancient Israel’s law need not view themselves as inferior, he quickly </p>
<p>challenges their inclination to view themselves as superior. God has not </p>
<p>abandoned his plan for the Jewish people, and uses Gentile converts as </p>
<p>part of that plan; they must not look down on Jewish people who do not </p>
<p>follow Jesus (ch. 11). Believers must serve one another (12:1–13) and love </p>
25. Although views of Romans’ purpose diverge widely (see Donfried 1991), the ap-
<p>parent majority of contemporary scholars (e.g., Wiefel, Sanders, Stendahl, Dunn, Lung-</p>
<p>Kwong) rightly recognize that Jewish-Gentile tensions are a factor in Romans. Even if </p>
<p>the Roman church was completely Gentile by this period, its relationship to Judaism (as </p>
<p>an intrinsic part of its heritage) remains key (cf. discussion in Das 2007). Some think </p>
<p>that Jewish antipathy toward Gentile governments in Judea may also aect the situation </p>
<p>(cf. Rom 13:1–7); most northern Mediterranean Jews, however, stayed clear of hints of </p>
<p>resistance.</p>
