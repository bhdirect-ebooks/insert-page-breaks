<p>Romans 14</p>
<p>Living the Christian Life (12:1—15:13), cont.</p>
<p>Serve the Lord vs. Foods and Days (14:1–12)</p>
<p>Although the subject changes here from 13:11–14, it continues Paul’s prac-</p>
<p>tical exhortations about relationships. Instead of generalities, however, </p>
<p>Paul now addresses at extended length (14:1—15:7) a more specic ten-</p>
<p>sion among believers in Rome. Paul has preached before against causing </p>
<p>stumbling over foods (1 Cor 8–10, addressing food oered to idols), but </p>
<p>now adjusts that theme to the specic tensions in the Roman church.</p>
<p>1</p>
Very detailed reconstructions regarding the views of diverse house churches (sometimes divided into four or ve distinct camps) extract too
<p>much from our limited evidence, but the general situation is clear from </p>
<p>Romans as a whole: Jewish and Gentile believers need mutual respect </p>
<p>(see introduction). Aside from concern with Jewish success at convert-</p>
<p>ing Roman women, Roman literature cites three issues for which Roman </p>
<p>Gentiles particularly looked down on Jews: circumcision, food customs, </p>
<p>and holy days (see e.g., Juvenal Sat. 14.96–106). Paul has already ad-</p>
<p>dressed circumcision in 2:25–29 and 4:9–12, but has reserved the other </p>
<p>two issues for his current exhortation. Because a major practical issue </p>
<p>might be reserved for the end of an argument, and because this section </p>
<p>focuses mostly on foods (holy days take up only 14:5–6), looking down </p>
<p>on one another’s food customs was probably a major problem among be-</p>
<p>lievers in Rome.</p>
<p>Paul’s key exhortation is “accept one another.” Apart from Phlm 17, </p>
<p>Paul’s extant letters employ this verb (proslambanō) only three times: at </p>
<p>the beginning (14:1, 3) and end (15:7) of this section. e context of 15:7 </p>
<p>indicates that Jews and Gentiles accepting one another (as Christ has ac-</p>
<p>cepted them) is a key issue (15:8–12).</p>
