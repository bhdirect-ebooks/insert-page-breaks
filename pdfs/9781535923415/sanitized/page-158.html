<p>Romans 11:1–10</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>sumably applies this passage to those who oppose him, inviting judgment </p>
<p>on them. Because their eyes are blinded (11:10), Paul could link this text </p>
<p>with his previous citation (in 11:8): it was not only Gentiles who were </p>
<p>“darkened” (1:21), but those who fancied themselves guides to the blind </p>
<p>and lights to those in darkness (2:19)!</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> eir “table” becoming a “stum-</p>
<p>bling block” (11:9) might anticipate the danger of stumbling over food </p>
<p>customs in 14:13.</p>
<p>God’s Purposes for Jews and Gentiles (11:11–24)</p>
<p>No one can boast; Jew and Gentile alike fulll roles in God’s plan, each </p>
<p>supporting the other. Clearly Israel “stumbled” (11:11), as Paul has shown </p>
<p>in biblical references to stumbling blocks (11:9; also 9:33)—ancient Jewish </p>
<p>sources oen used “stumbling” as a gure for apostasy.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>But Paul does not</p>
believe that they have “stumbled” in order that (for the divine purpose
<p>that) they should “fall” permanently; rather, God’s purpose is to let sal-</p>
<p>vation come to Gentiles, in turn provoking Israel to repentance (11:11). </p>
<p>at way, representatives from all peoples, Jewish and Gentile, could </p>
<p>have the opportunity for salvation (11:30–33). Possibly Paul is thinking </p>
<p>of how God’s promises to Israel would establish a new world once Israel </p>
<p>fully turned to him (e.g., Hos 14:1–7; Jer 29:12–14);</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>only if that general</p>
<p>repentance were delayed could Gentiles have the opportunity to turn in </p>
<p>large numbers as well.</p>
<p>Paul believes that the Gentile mission is part of God’s eschatological </p>
<p>plan to provoke Israel to jealousy, hence repentance (11:11, 14),</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>as he</p>
<p>has already argued scripturally (10:19). He believes that his mission to </p>
<p>5. Against most translations, though, dia pantos in 11:10 should be rendered “con-</p>
<p>tinually” (as elsewhere in the nt, and with most current commentators) rather than </p>
<p>“forever.” It does not exclude Israel’s future.</p>
<p>6. E.g., Ezek 14:3–7; Sir 9:5; other sources cited at 14:4. Paul normally uses skandalizō, </p>
<p>ptaiō, and piptō interchangeably in this context (cf. 11:22; 14:4), despite 11:11 (where </p>
<p>ptaiō is used to connect with paraptōma in 11:11–12).</p>
<p>7. In early Jewish sources, the timing of the kingdom was sometimes (though not </p>
<p>always) held to be contingent on Israel’s repentance (Jub. 23:26–27; Sipre Deut. 43.16.3; </p>
<p>see further Talbert 2002: 260–61; discussion of later rabbinic material in Moore 1971: </p>
<p>2:350–51).</p>
<p>8. Speakers could deliberately provoke hearers to jealousy of rivals to spur greater </p>
<p>action (Rhet. Alex. 36, 1445a.12; Polybius 6.39.8).</p>
