<p>Romans 7:1–6</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>constitute one esh. us he elsewhere uses the language of Gen 2:24 for </p>
<p>the believer’s spiritual marriage to Christ (1 Cor 6:16–17). Paul’s analogy </p>
<p>does not neglect the issue of how a dead wife can marry; believers, dead </p>
<p>with Christ to Adamic existence, are united with the risen Christ. Instead </p>
<p>of producing physical ospring, this union results in fruit (karpophoreō) </p>
<p>for God (7:4), as opposed to bearing fruit for death (7:5; cf. the karpos, </p>
<p>“fruit” or “outcome,” of life and death in 6:21–22).</p>
<p>Paul argues that believers are no longer “in the esh,” ruled by death-</p>
<p>bearing passions working in their bodily members (7:5). is is because </p>
<p>they have died and now belong to a dierent “body,” the risen body of </p>
<p>Christ (7:4). (Paul is building on the notion of solidarity with Christ in </p>
<p>5:12–21 and 6:3–11.)</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> Believers freed from law are still servants, but ser-</p>
<p>vants of God (cf. 6:22) who “serve” (douleuō) in “newness” (7:6). is </p>
<p>“newness” clearly evokes believers’ newness of life with Christ in 6:4; it </p>
<p>contrasts with “oldness” (7:6) that evokes the old life in the old Adam in </p>
<p>6:6. e “new” way conicts with the values of the present age (12:2).</p>
<p>e new life in 7:6 is empowered by the Spirit rather than the “letter,” </p>
<p>a contrast Paul will develop further in 8:2–4 (where believers fulll righ-</p>
<p>teousness by God’s Spirit empowering them rather than by external regu-</p>
<p>lations). Paul uses “letter” for the mere written details of the law (Jewish </p>
<p>teachers could focus even on details of spelling) as opposed to its heart </p>
<p>(2:27, 29).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Another context where he raises the contrast (2 Cor 3:6–7)</p>
<p>suggests that Paul denigrates the old covenant only by way of compari-</p>
<p>son with the new covenant, in which the promised (eschatological) Spirit </p>
<p>would write the laws in the hearts of God’s people (blending Jer 31:31–34 </p>
<p>with Ezek 36:26–27; cf. Rom 8:2).</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>In 7:5–6 Paul lays out the contrast that</p>
<p>he will develop between life under the law and death in the esh (7:7–25; </p>
<p>as in 7:5), and life in the Spirit (8:1–17; as in 7:6).</p>
<p>5. at the link between these “bodies” is more than coincidental is suggested by </p>
<p>the collocation of both in close contexts in Rom 12:1, 4–5; 1 Cor 11:24; 12:12–27; Col </p>
<p>1:22–24; 2:11, 19, 23; 3:5, 15. e movement is from Adam’s seed, dependent on him for </p>
<p>their identity, to Christ’s body, dependent on him.</p>
<p>6. Ancient legal interpreters also dierentiated what we would call the mere letter of </p>
<p>the law from its intent (Hermogenes Issues 40.6–19; 80.10–13; 82.4–5; 83.20; cf. Cohen </p>
<p>1966: 39–62).</p>
<p>7. For this argument in 2 Cor 3:3–6, see e.g., Keener 2005b: 167–68. In some ancient </p>
<p>comparisons, both objects of comparison were positive (see sources in Keener 2003b: </p>
<p>916–17).</p>
