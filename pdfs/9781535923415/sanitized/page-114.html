<p>Excursus: Paul and the Law in Romans</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>Fleshly passions worked in body via </p>
<p>law → fruit for death (7:5)</p>
<p>Fruit for God (7:4); released from/</p>
<p>dead to law (7:6)</p>
<p>Oldness of the letter (7:6; cf. old </p>
<p>humanity, 6:6)</p>
<p>Newness of the Spirit (7:6; cf. </p>
<p>newness of life, 6:4)</p>
<p>Law of sin and death (8:2) Law of the Spirit (8:2)</p>
<p>Law could not deliver from sin </p>
<p>(8:3)</p>
<p>God delivered from sin (8:3)</p>
<p>Flesh (8:3–9) Spirit (8:3–9)</p>
<p>Fleshly perspective is death (8:6) Spirit-perspective is life and peace </p>
<p>(8:6)</p>
<p>Body is dead on account of sin </p>
<p>(8:10)</p>
<p>Spirit is life on account of </p>
<p>righteousness (8:10)</p>
<p>Those who live according to the </p>
<p>ﬂesh must die (8:13)</p>
<p>Those who kill the works of the </p>
<p>body will live (8:13)</p>
<p>Spirit of slavery (8:15) Spirit of adoption (8:15)</p>
<p>Thus Paul contrasts sin and righteousness, death and life, condemnation and </p>
<p>acquittal, and slavery and freedom (though this pair can be inverted).</p>
<p>Yet he also occasionally mentions law in this contrast, and places it on </p>
<p>the sin/death side of the ledger. It is no surprise that the shocked interlocutor </p>
<p>objects, “Is the law sin?” (7:7). But the written law is good; it was simply a </p>
<p>partial solution for humanity in Adam, however, until its fuller substance could </p>
<p>be inscribed on transformed hearts (8:2). God gave the righteous law’s stipu-</p>
<p>lations to identify and restrain sin, but on their own they would not change </p>
<p>the heart. The law was not sin, but merely a catalyst that ampliﬁed sinfulness </p>
<p>(4:15; 5:13, 20; 6:14; 7:5, 7); sin exploited it. Without Christ, the law could </p>
<p>only inform, but the Spirit would transform.</p>
<p>For Paul, the law is good (7:12, 14); the problem is not the law but </p>
<p>ﬂesh, which law was designed to control, not transform (8:3).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Nevertheless,</p>
<p>the regulations of the law pointed God’s people to his righteousness. When ap-</p>
<p>proached the right way, as God’s message and witness rather than a standard </p>
<p>to achieve, the law supported the truth of the gospel (3:31; 10:6–8). Thus the </p>
<p>law must be approached by faith rather than works (i.e., trust in God instead </p>
<p>of ﬂesh, 3:27; 9:31–32). Its content must be inscribed on the heart by the </p>
<p>Spirit rather than depending on efforts of the ﬂesh (8:2–4). Paul teaches not </p>
<p>only moral truths, but even the way of the gospel itself, from the law. This </p>
<p>8. Sanders 1983b argues that Paul treats the law’s purpose dierently in dierent ar-</p>
<p>guments, but remains consistent in his thesis that all are saved only through Christ.</p>
