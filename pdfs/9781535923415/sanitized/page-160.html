<p>Romans 11:11–24</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>described as “fullness” (plērōma, 11:12), just as the conversion of the full </p>
<p>measure of Gentles is in 11:25.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>One could be condent of God’s benevolent plan for Israel’s future </p>
<p>based on its heritage (11:16). Oering the rst fruits consecrated the en-</p>
<p>tire batch of dough as acceptable; while “rst fruits” could refer to rst </p>
<p>converts (1 Cor 16:15), here it probably refers to the patriarchs, as in the </p>
<p>next illustration. Just as it was a commonplace that a tree was known by </p>
<p>its fruit (cf. 7:4; Matt 7:17–18; 12:33; Luke 6:43–44; Jas 3:12), branches </p>
<p>would be as holy as the root, which for a Jewish audience would typically </p>
<p>point to the patriarchs.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Gentiles could be graed into the tree (11:17),</p>
<p>but Jewish believers t most naturally (11:18, 24), and Paul expects a </p>
<p>large-scale turning of Jewish people to faith in Christ (11:23–27).</p>
<p>In 11:17 Paul arms that Gentile believers are not just second-class </p>
<p>(though saved) adherents, as synagogues considered God-fearing, righ-</p>
<p>teous Gentiles. (Some of Paul’s detractors in Jerusalem may have shared </p>
<p>this synagogue view; cf. the compromise position in Acts 15:20.) Rather, </p>
<p>they are spiritual proselytes, graed into Israel as full members.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>us,</p>
<p>they are spiritual children of Abraham (4:12, 16) and spiritually circum-</p>
<p>cised (2:28–29). Such a status did not, however, give them the right to </p>
<p>look down on Jews who had broken the covenant by rejecting the cur-</p>
<p>rent prophetic message and ruler God appointed for them (11:18). Like </p>
<p>the Qumran sectarians,</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> Paul and apostolic Christianity viewed them-</p>
<p>selves as truly fullling God’s end-time purposes, and the rest of Israel as </p>
<p>apostate.</p>
<p>But to look down on Jewish people as a whole was to despise the very </p>
<p>people into which one had been graed, people who t that heritage most </p>
<p>naturally if they embraced Christ (11:18, 23–24). Earlier Paul warned </p>
<p>against “boasting,” envisioning Jewish boasting in possession and fulll-</p>
<p>ment of the law (2:17, 23; cf. 3:27; 4:2); here, however, Paul recognizes that </p>
<p>Gentile Christians could be guilty of the same oense, boasting against </p>
<p>14. “Fullness” here and in 11:25 probably indicates the full measure in contrast to the </p>
<p>“remnant” (or perhaps “rst fruits”; cf. the “fullness” of the land in Jer 8:16; 47:2; Ezek </p>
<p>12:19; 19:7); cf. the idea in Rev 6:11.</p>
<p>15. E.g., 1 En. 93:5–8; Pesiq. Rab Kah. 15:5; other sources in Moo 1996: 699. at </p>
<p>15:12 employs the same term for “root” is probably coincidental, since the root there </p>
<p>involves only David’s lineage (and the “branch” of the quotation’s context is messianic).</p>
