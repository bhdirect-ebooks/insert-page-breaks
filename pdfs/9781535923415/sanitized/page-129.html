<p>Life in Christ and the Spirit</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>that Paul is simply teaching Aramaic to Greek-speaking Christians in </p>
<p>Rome in reciting, “Abba”; rather, he is evoking Jesus’s own prayer (per-</p>
<p>haps even the specically preserved one, as Jesus faced suering; Mark </p>
<p>14:36). ose who have been baptized into Christ (6:3–4) share his son-</p>
<p>ship, hence his inheritance (8:17).</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>ey conrm that status by sharing</p>
<p>his suerings, guaranteeing that they will also share his resurrected glory </p>
<p>(8:17). (If one side of the cross involves Jesus taking believers’ sin, the </p>
<p>other side involves them sharing his suerings for righteousness.)</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Faith and Righteousness</p>
<p>When Paul opposes “law-works” to “Jesus-faith,” he is not against obeying </p>
<p>the law. It is in fact Jesus-faith that he claims produces true righteousness </p>
<p>from the heart. The problem is not obeying the law, but seeking to be made </p>
<p>right with God by it, apart from dependence on God’s mercy. In fact, most </p>
<p>Jewish thinkers would have agreed with Paul that people depended on God’s </p>
<p>mercy, although they did not usually radically contrast this appearance with </p>
<p>human merit the way Paul did.</p>
<p>Jesus-faith means that believers must depend on (and be loyal to) what </p>
<p>God has accomplished in Jesus to make them right with him. God has ac-</p>
<p>counted such dependence as righteousness, so that those loyal to Jesus are </p>
<p>acquitted and in right relationship with God. But just as God “accounts” or </p>
<p>“reckons” such faith as righteousness (eleven times in ch. 4), those who trust </p>
<p>Jesus should learn to trust enough to believe God’s verdict, and “reckon” </p>
<p>righteousness to their own account (Rom 6:11). They should believe their new </p>
<p>identity in Christ and live accordingly.</p>
<p>When Christians do not live out the character of God’s Spirit living in </p>
<p>them (cf. the “fruit of the Spirit” in Gal 5:22–23), we fail to take saving faith </p>
<p>to its logical conclusion. We do not do righteousness to get God’s gift; rather, </p>
<p>righteousness is God’s gift in Christ, and we demonstrate active faith in Christ </p>
<p>as we live accordingly. We do not stop sinning in order to be “saved”; rather, </p>
<p>we are “saved” from sin through faith. To the extent that we really believe, </p>
<p>however, we should live accordingly. While Paul usually presents this ideal </p>
<p>in terms of two contrasting options (e.g., Spirit versus ﬂesh, 8:3–11), the </p>
<p>17. On eschatological “inheritance,” see Hester 1968; comment on 4:13. Paul’s repeti-</p>
<p>tion of “children” from 8:16 is anadiplosis (for rhetorical reinforcement); on the relation-</p>
<p>ship between adoption and inheritance, see e.g., Walters 2003.</p>
