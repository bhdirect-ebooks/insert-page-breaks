<p>Life in Christ and the Spirit</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>people compared the expected end-time tribulation with birth pangs for </p>
<p>the new world. For believers living between the Messiah’s rst and second </p>
<p>comings, that era of eschatological suering was present (cf. Mark 13:7–8; </p>
<p>Rev 12:2–5).</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>Just as the messiah and his kingdom both had come and remained </p>
<p>yet to come, believers are already adopted (8:15) and redeemed (3:24), yet </p>
<p>in 8:23 they await the application of this reality to their bodies. Waiting </p>
<p>for what is yet unseen exercises hope (8:24–25; cf. 2 Cor 4:18), which is </p>
<p>deepened through tribulation and consequent endurance (Rom 5:3–4).</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e hope is not simply imagination, however, for it is grounded in a rm </p>
<p>guarantee: just as the “rst fruits” was the actual beginning of the harvest, </p>
<p>so the Spirit within believers is their initial experience of the future age </p>
<p>(8:23; cf. 8:11).</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>Not only do creation and believers groan with eagerness for libera-</p>
<p>tion, but Christ’s own Spirit groans with believers in their suering, eager </p>
<p>for their deliverance (8:26).</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Whatever the other benets of the Spirit’s</p>
<p>intercession (8:26–27), the Spirit works within believers during their suf-</p>
<p>ferings to prepare them for conformity with the image of the crucied </p>
<p>and resurrected Christ (8:28–29), i.e., to share his glory (8:30). e Spirit </p>
<p>“helps”</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>believers in the weakness of their current bodily state (cf. 6:19;</p>
<p>8:3; 2 Cor 12:9); just as Israel’s groans in suering counted as prayers </p>
<p>(Exod 2:23), so the Spirit oers an inarticulate prayer when believers are </p>
<p>pressed by the hardships of the current age.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>e prophetic Spirit leads</p>
<p>Paul, see Gal 4:19, 27.</p>
<p>32. e Qumran sectarians also apparently believed that they were living in the end-</p>
<p>time tribulation, a period initially designated for a forty-year generation (CD 20.14–15) </p>
<p>but that was then stretched to t the duration of their exile (1QpHab 7.13–14).</p>
<p>33. Cf. possibly Hab 2:3, in the immediate context of Paul’s controlling text in Rom </p>
<p>1:17.</p>
<p>34. For the Spirit and eschatology in Paul, see e.g., Cullmann 1956: 117; Dunn 1975: </p>
<p>308–18.</p>
<p>35. For God’s eagerness for his people’s deliverance, cf. Isa 30:18; b. Sanh. 97b.</p>
<p>36. e term “help with” applies to supporters to whom work is delegated in Exod </p>
<p>18:22; Num 11:17; in the latter, the Spirit enables this support. Probably more relevant </p>
<p>are texts about God sustaining his people (e.g., Pss 3:5; 18:35; 40:11; 41:12; 119:116; Isa </p>
<p>26:3), perhaps especially Isa 42:1 (involving the Spirit). Paul employs an intensive form </p>
<p>of the verb here; God is so worthy that only his Spirit can inspire adequately worthy wor-</p>
<p>ship and intercession (cf. Origen Prayer 4; Gregory of Nazianzus Or. Bas. 31.12).</p>
<p>37. Against some commentators, this is an experience dierent from tongues, which </p>
<p>Paul values (1 Cor 12:10; 14:18) but regards as articulate. Some experiences were consid-</p>
