<p>Introduction</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>this letter’s opening. (He becomes more specic, however, in 1:8–17, esp. </p>
<p>1:16–17.)</p>
<p>Paul</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>begins by identifying himself as a slave of Christ, a called</p>
<p>apostle, and one set apart for God’s good news. Although apostleship </p>
<p>may be his distinctive gi (1:5; 11:13), he will return to many of these </p>
<p>descriptions with regard to believers more generally: their slavery to God </p>
<p>versus slavery to sin (6:6, 16–22; 7:6, 25; 8:15; 12:11; 14:18; 16:18), their </p>
<p>God-initiated “calling” (1:6–7; 8:28, 30; 9:7, 12, 24–26), and their being </p>
<p>“set apart” for God (1:7; 6:19, 22; 8:27; 11:16; 12:1, 13; 15:16, 25–26, 31; </p>
<p>16:2, 15). e “good news” (“gospel”) is one of his major themes in the </p>
<p>letter and lies at the heart of his own mission (1:9, 15–16; 2:16; 10:15–16; </p>
<p>11:28; 15:16, 19–20; 16:25; see comment on 1:16).</p>
<p>Although free persons normally did not consider “slavery” an </p>
<p>honorable status, slaves were not all of one kind. Some slaves of Caesar </p>
<p>wielded more power than free aristocrats, and some aristocratic women </p>
<p>even married into slavery (in Caesar’s household) to improve their status. </p>
<p>Slavery to the supreme Lord Jesus was no dishonor; it resembled the ot </p>
<p>situation of the prophets and some other godly leaders of Israel as “ser-</p>
<p>vants of God.”</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>e nature of Paul’s slavery to Christ is connected with his</p>
<p>being “set apart” (in God’s plan, even from the womb; cf. Gal 1:15) for the </p>
<p>good news. God had revealed this purpose for Paul at his calling, when he </p>
<p>was converted (cf. Gal 1:16; Acts 26:16).</p>
<p>Paul cannot introduce himself and his mission without talking about </p>
<p>the God he serves. Sophisticated Greek writers sometimes circled back to </p>
<p>their point, as Paul does here:</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>he returns to his apostleship as a mission to</p>
<p>the Gentiles in 1:5, but rst he explicates the content of the good news he </p>
<p>mentioned in 1:1. e good news Paul proclaims is just what the prophets </p>
<p>announced (1:2; cf. 3:21; 16:26), hence Paul’s heavy use of Scripture in </p>
<p>this letter focused on his gospel. (Roughly half of Paul’s extant quotations </p>
<p>5. Paul’s Roman name itself was most oen a Roman cognomen usually belonging </p>
<p>to Roman citizens and typically associated with high status (cf. Judge 1982: 36 n. 20). </p>
<p>Roman Jews usually avoided using their full (three-part) Roman names, and most letters </p>
<p>omit such full names anyway, but Romans would likely infer Paul’s citizen status (cf. </p>
<p>Rapske 1994: 85–86; Lüdemann 1989: 241). Paul’s own interest, however, is in commu-</p>
nicating his divinely ordained mission.
