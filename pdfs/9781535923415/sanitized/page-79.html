<p>Made Right by Trusting Christ</p>

<p>be judged harshly (3:5, 7).</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>But God, who is righteous to judge the world</p>
<p>(i.e., all nations; 3:6), is also righteous to judge his disobedient people. </p>
<p>(Even the interlocutor accepts the premise that God will judge the world.) </p>
<p>In fact, one who tries to justify sinners on account of God’s glory may as </p>
<p>well argue, “Let us commit evil because the result will be good” (3:8). But </p>
<p>God’s glory would be displayed in his righteous judgment of such sinners, </p>
<p>not by exonerating them!</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Presumably by twisting Paul’s argument about</p>
<p>justication by faith, some had insisted</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>that Paul essentially taught that</p>
<p>one may as well sin—a perversion of the doctrine also popular today. is </p>
<p>conception entirely misses Paul’s point, as his letter will go on to make </p>
<p>clear: one truly “righteoused” by faith is not only put in right relationship </p>
<p>with God, but now has new power to live righteously (by faith that God </p>
<p>has made them share Christ’s victory over sin; Rom 6; cf. Gal 2:17–21; </p>
<p>5:5–6, 24).</p>
<p>All under Sin (3:9–20)</p>
<p>While God has been faithful to the covenant (3:1–8), Israel has not (3:9–</p>
<p>20). Paul graphically underlines the sinfulness of Jews as well as Gentiles, </p>
<p>but the point he makes by itself would not be controversial. Jewish sources </p>
<p>concur that all, or virtually all, sinned.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>What is striking about Paul is the</p>
<p>7. One could argue that a good outcome mitigated one’s wrongdoing (Hermogenes </p>
<p>Issues 38.20–25), or occasionally even declare sinners righteous because God brought </p>
<p>their acts about (Tg. Neof. 1 on Gen 38:25). Moralists would demur (e.g., Seneca Ep. </p>
<p>Lucil. 87.22, 25).</p>
<p>8. eir behavior in fact causes God to be blasphemed (2:24), not gloried.</p>
<p>9. Both Jewish and Gentile sources denounce slander as a terrible sin; it appears in </p>
<p>Paul’s list in Rom 1:30. Rumors apparently spread about Paul in the Jerusalem church </p>
<p>(Acts 21:21). Attributing the slander to “certain persons” might follow the common </p>
<p>practice of damning some opponents with anonymity. at sin “demonstrated” God’s </p>
<p>righteousness (3:5) may be a perversion of Paul’s teaching that God “demonstrated” love </p>
<p>toward sinners (5:8).</p>
<p>10. 1 Esd 4:37; 1QS 11.9–10; 1QH 4.29–30; 16.11; cf. Jub. 21:21; Moore 1971: 467–68; </p>
<p>Bonsirven 1964: 114. Greeks also regarded genuinely good persons as few (Epictetus </p>
<p>Disc. 2.19.26–27; Dio Chrysostom Or. 13.13; Lucian Tim. 25; Diogenes Laertius 1.88; </p>
<p>Malherbe 1989: 17; cf. Rom 5:7). Some held that only virtually all sinned, sometimes ex-</p>
<p>empting some famous patriarchs (Pr Man 8; T. Ab. 10 A; Bray 1998: 149 cites eodoret </p>
<p>of Cyr Interp. Rom. on Rom 5:19) or others (’Abot R. Nat. 14A); some others attributed </p>
<p>sin even to the patriarchs (e.g., T. Ab. 9, Rec. A).</p>
