<p>Fusing the Horizons: Homosexual Activity</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>Pederasty and Other Exploitation</p>
<p>The vast majority of homosexual affection in the ancient Mediterranean world </p>
<p>was directed toward boys (pederasty) or young men.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>Greeks openly admired</p>
<p>young men’s beauty,</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> but it was held to decline with puberty and the at-</p>
<p>tendant growth of facial hair and other speciﬁcally masculine characteristics. </p>
<p>Some slaveholders, mocked by many of their contemporaries, tried to pre-</p>
<p>vent masculinization by having hairs plucked or, worse, turning boys into eu-</p>
<p>nuchs.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>Some remained objects of homosexual affection through their teens,</p>
<p>and some, like Alcibiades, drew comments about their handsomeness much </p>
<p>later. We do read of homosexual relations between fully mature men, but by </p>
<p>far the predominant form of homosexual interest remained that of men toward </p>
<p>prepubescent and adolescent males. The unequal status of the partners was </p>
<p>compared to that of men with women (whose status had been notoriously </p>
<p>low in classical Athens), with the dominant partner on top when intercourse </p>
<p>occurred.</p>
<p>This interest often took the form of courting with gifts and interest, </p>
<p>which many Greeks found entertaining. Although today any such behavior </p>
<p>would be considered exploitive, Greeks counted only excesses, such as more </p>
<p>blatant seduction or rape, as taking unfair advantage of a boy and inviting </p>
<p>severe punishments. Even such crimes generated outrage only when com-</p>
<p>mitted against boys who were free; even aristocratic Romans by this period </p>
<p>employed slave boys at banquets who, like female slaves and prostitutes, </p>
<p>could be exploited sexually. It was preferred that they remain “effeminate,” a </p>
<p>behavior counted undigniﬁed and mocked when practiced by free men. (Those </p>
<p>whose masculinity was physically impaired, such as eunuchs, generally faced </p>
<p>the same derision.) Men could also ﬁnd sexual outlets with male prostitutes; </p>
<p>whereas pimps could exploit slaves for this role without public protest, the </p>
<p>voluntary involvement of free young men invited disrespect toward the latter.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Teachers, conquerors, and emperors were all reputed to sexually exploit boys </p>
<p>(as well as, when available, young women).</p>
<p>91. On this point, Scroggs 1983: 29–43, is certainly correct.</p>
<p>92. Socrates was known for having spent much time with handsome young men </p>
<p>enjoying their beauty without intercourse (although satirists like Lucian suggested that </p>
<p>everyone really knew better; Lucian Ver. hist. 2.19; Vit. auct. 15).</p>
<p>93. Cf. e.g., Seneca Ep. 47.7; Dio Chrysostom Or. 77/78.36; Suetonius Dom. 7.1; </p>
<p>Bradley 1987: 115; cf. Ps.-Lucian Am. 10.</p>
<p>94. See Höcker 2008: 59–60; Hartmann 2005: 469–70; cf. Aeschines Tim. 21, 51–53, </p>
<p>74, 137; Polybius 8.9.12; Dionysius Epid. 7.291; Lucian Alex. 5–6.</p>
