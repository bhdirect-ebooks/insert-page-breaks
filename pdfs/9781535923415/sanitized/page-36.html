<p>Jews in Rome</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Estimates of Rome’s Jewish population tend to run between about twenty </p>
<p>thousand and y thousand; such estimates are at best educated guesses, </p>
<p>but they probably suggest the right order of magnitude.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Estimates of</p>
<p>Rome’s population also vary, from perhaps a quarter of a million (ex-</p>
<p>trapolated from water supplies) to over a million for its metropolitan area </p>
<p>(extrapolated, in my opinion more reliably, from concrete census gures </p>
<p>from ancient historians).</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> It is at any rate clear that the Jewish commu-</p>
<p>nity was a small minority, though signicant among the Greek-speaking </p>
<p>minority immigrant populations from the eastern Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Jewish people lived together in several suburbs of the city, generally </p>
<p>in mostly ethnically segregated neighborhoods. e majority remained in </p>
<p>their original area, Transtiberinum (what is today Trastevere), across the </p>
<p>Tiber from the city’s center. Archaeology indicates that most Jews there </p>
<p>were poor; many probably worked at the Tiber’s docks.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Nevertheless,</p>
<p>there were well-to-do members. We know the names of three to ve </p>
<p>Roman synagogues from this period, which appear to have been con-</p>
<p>nected only loosely, since Rome did not allow any unifying leadership </p>
<p>as, e.g., in Alexandria. Archaeological evidence suggests that many had </p>
settled from various parts of the Diaspora and were thus fairly diverse.
<p>is loose structure may have helped facilitate the free spread of the mes-</p>
<p>sage about Jesus in some of the synagogues.</p>

<p>18. See Clarke 1994: 464–66; Garnsey and Saller 1987: 83; for estimates approaching </p>
<p>a million, see Stambaugh 1988: 89; Packer 1967: 87; below a quarter million, Rohrbaugh </p>
<p>1991: 133. For earlier periods, with over one hundred thousand adult citizens (thus not </p>
<p>counting children, slaves, and non-citizen residents), see e.g., Dionysius of Halicarnassus </p>
<p>Ant. rom. 5.20.1; 5.75.3; 6.96.4; 9.15.2; 9.36.3; cf. Plutarch Caesar 55.3; Suetonius Jul. 41. </p>
<p>Some estimates are much higher (e.g., Carcopino 1940: 20–21). Ancients could speak </p>
<p>either of the area inside the city walls (e.g., Pliny the Elder Nat. 3.5.66) or of larger Rome </p>
<p>(idem 3.5.67).</p>
<p>19. Jeers 1998: 131. In Rome as a whole, rich and poor oen lived side by side, the </p>
<p>latter especially in crowded tenements, with the poorest tending to live higher up in the </p>
<p>sometimes imsy and ammable structures.</p>
