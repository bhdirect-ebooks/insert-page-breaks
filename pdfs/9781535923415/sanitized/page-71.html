<p>e righteous do good works </p>
<p>(2:7)</p>
<p>ese cannot be Jewish law-works (3:20, </p>
<p>27–28)</p>
<p>e righteous endure (2:7) Believers endure (5:3–4; 8:25; 12:12; </p>
<p>15:4–5)</p>
<p>e righteous “seek” for </p>
<p>glory (2:7)</p>
<p>No one “seeks” for God (3:11); one must </p>
<p>not “seek” righteousness the wrong way </p>
<p>(10:3, 20)</p>
<p>e righteous seek glory and </p>
<p>honor (2:7, 10)</p>
<p>Humanity lost God’s glory (3:23), but glory </p>
<p>awaits believers (5:2; 8:18, 21; 9:21, 23)</p>
<p>e righteous receive eternal </p>
<p>life (2:7)</p>
<p>Believers in Jesus receive eternal life (5:21; </p>
<p>6:22–23; cf. 8:13)</p>
<p>e righteous will have peace </p>
<p>(2:10)</p>
<p>Humanity does not know peace (3:17), but </p>
<p>believers will have it (5:1; 8:6; 14:17)</p>
<p>e righteous do “good” </p>
<p>(2:7, 10)</p>
<p>e wicked do not do good (7:18–19; cf. </p>
<p>3:10); believers should do what is good </p>
<p>(12:9, 21; 13:4; 15:2)</p>
<p>Doers of good include both </p>
<p>Jews and Greeks (2:10)</p>
<p>Both Jews and Gentiles are under sin (3:9); </p>
<p>the community of believers includes both </p>
<p>Jews and Gentiles (1:16; 9:24; 10:12; cf. </p>
<p>3:29)</p>
<p>us while Paul is focusing on God’s ethnic impartiality rather than </p>
<p>on believers here, when he later addresses such issues he seems to assume </p>
<p>that it is believers in Jesus who are able to fulll the role of the righteous. </p>
<p>Christ comes not merely to forgive unrighteousness but to empower for </p>
<p>righteous living.</p>
<p>Scholars again dier as to whether the law in obedient Gentiles’ hearts </p>
<p>by nature (2:14–15) refers to Christians or to conscience in all humans. </p>
<p>In practice, it those in whom the Spirit dwells (Jew or Gentile) who fulll </p>
<p>the heart of God’s law (8:2–4; Jer 31:31–34).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>ere may be an element of</p>
<p>such emphasis here, preparing for 2:29. Nevertheless, Christians also had </p>
<p>access to the written law, so in 2:14–15 Paul probably focuses more gener-</p>
<p>ally on a natural law innate in humanity. He has already spoken of God’s </p>
<p>revelation in creation (1:20), including within humans (1:19), and he also </p>
<p>12. ey even have the Spirit “testifying” like the conscience here (8:16), while appar-</p>
<p>ently retaining conscience’s testimony as well (9:1).</p>
