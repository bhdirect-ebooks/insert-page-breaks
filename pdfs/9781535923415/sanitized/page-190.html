<p>Romans 14:1–12</p>
<p>164</p>
<p>to make one “stand” (14:4), i.e., stand rm in the faith (cf. Rom 11:20; 1 </p>
<p>Cor 10:12), and it is no one else’s place to judge God’s slaves (Rom 14:4; </p>
<p>for God’s slaves cf. e.g., 1:1; 6:22). (Although Paul uses “falling” language </p>
<p>here, perhaps based on his more general preaching on this topic reected </p>
<p>in 1 Cor 8:9, 13, “judging” others is also central here.)</p>
<p>In 14:5–6 Paul briey introduces, as if by way of a supporting illus-</p>
<p>tration, the keeping of dierent days. Perhaps Paul expected his audience </p>
<p>in Rome to agree with him regarding days, and hence he could use this as </p>
<p>part of his argument. Paul himself did not have high regard for merely ex-</p>
<p>changing Gentile sacred days for Jewish ones (Gal 4:9–10). Nevertheless, </p>
<p>it would seem surprising if the Sabbath were less of a controversy than </p>
<p>food customs, even if everyone believed that the law of Moses was no </p>
<p>longer in eect. While God-fearing Gentiles who were not full proselytes </p>
<p>might not be expected to keep the Sabbath,</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>the Sabbath, in contrast to</p>
<p>the food laws, was illustrated in creation before the birth of Israel (Gen </p>
<p>2:2–3; Exod 20:11). Although Jesus countered a strict approach to the </p>
<p>Sabbath, it is not clear that he did away with it,</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>and early believers in</p>
<p>Jesus continued to designate the seventh day by that term (Acts 1:12), al-</p>
<p>beit especially regarding conventional Jewish gatherings (e.g., Acts 13:44; </p>
<p>16:13).</p>
<p>How do we reconcile this brief passage with the larger witness of </p>
<p>the ot on which Paul normally depended (cf. e.g., Exod 31:14–15; 35:2; </p>
<p>Jer 17:21–27; Ezek 20:12–24; 22:26; 44:24; 46:1–12), including regarding </p>
<p>faithful Gentiles (Isa 56:3–8)? Perhaps Paul simply did not expect Gentiles </p>
<p>to keep festivals celebrating specically Jewish deliverances (e.g., Passover, </p>
<p>Purim), in contrast to the more universal Sabbath. is is a possibility, but </p>
<p>early Christians in general apparently remained familiar with these other </p>
<p>festivals as well (1 Cor 5:7; Acts 20:6, 16), and the Sabbath was the larg-</p>
<p>est issue of contention between Jews and Gentiles regarding holy days. </p>
<p>Others have suggested that Paul refers not to the Sabbath or even festivals </p>
<p>but to fast days (which some strict Judean pietists observed even twice a </p>
<p>week); this proposal ts the context of foods. If he refers to the Sabbath, </p>
<p>perhaps Paul was simply pragmatic: unless they belonged to the ethnic </p>
<p>enclave of Israel, Gentile slaves and workers normally could not observe </p>
<p>the Sabbath fully, and Paul did not require this ideal of those who could </p>
<p>18. e later practice of using a Gentile as an agent on the Sabbath, however, was </p>
<p>problematic (CD 11.2; m. Shab. 16:8; t. Shab. 13:9; cf. Exod 20:10; Deut 5:14).</p>
<p>19. See e.g., Vermes 1993: 13; Keener 1999: 350, 353–54; idem 2003b: 643–46.</p>
