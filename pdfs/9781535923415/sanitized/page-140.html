<p>Fusing the Horizons: Suering</p>

<p>Moreover, the possibility of chaos is not far from any society. For example, </p>
<p>an infrastructure collapse would threaten massive death in heavily urbanized, </p>
<p>economically interdependent societies. Yet even without such large-scale </p>
<p>catastrophes, all believers face suffering—the death of a family member, </p>
<p>struggles with a severely autistic child, miscarriages, and so on.</p>
<p>Counselors warn against giving a glib assertion that “all things work for </p>
<p>good” to a person who is suffering. Instead, we should begin to learn to trust </p>
<p>Paul’s message of God’s sovereign care and destiny for us before we suffer. </p>
<p>At times we may be content learning such ideas without incorporating them </p>
<p>in our lives; when we face suffering, however, with only God to cling to, the </p>
<p>genuineness of our faith is tested. Then, with God’s help, we have opportunity </p>
<p>to show our faith, to further develop an intellectual afﬁrmation into a life of </p>
<p>deeper trust.</p>
