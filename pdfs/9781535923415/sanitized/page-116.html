<p>Romans 7:7–13</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>ists emphasized controlling passions and avoiding pleasure,</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>and some</p>
<p>Diaspora Jewish intellectuals applied this commandment accordingly.)</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ose raised with the law might obey most of its precepts from upbring-</p>
<p>ing and habit, as part of their culture, but only those in whose hearts the </p>
<p>law was written would always desire to keep the commandments. (e </p>
<p>objects of coveting specied in Exod 20:17 are also objects of command-</p>
<p>ments against the and adultery.) Once the law identied sin, the person </p>
<p>committing the sin was violating God’s will more knowingly, rendering </p>
<p>sin the more heinous and the sinner the more culpable (7:7–8).</p>
<p>God designed the law to grant life to those who obeyed it (7:10; </p>
<p>10:5),</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>but because sinful humans would disobey it, it produced death</p>
<p>(7:9–10; cf. 7:5). While Paul earlier mentioned that Adam brought death </p>
into the world (5:12–21), it was under the law—a divine standard of mor-
<p>al truth—that sin became most evident, exposing humanity’s complicity </p>
<p>with it (5:13, 20; cf. 2:12; 3:20; 4:15). e law thus became a further agent </p>
<p>of death, validating that those who sinned merited this sentence (cf. 1:32). </p>
<p>(Some associate receiving the law with the tradition of bar mitzvah, at ad-</p>
<p>olescence; but Paul probably refers to a moral consciousness that begins </p>
<p>much earlier, before an understanding of the law’s moral demands.)</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Scholars debate whether Paul is the primary speaker in these verses, </p>
<p>or whether he is “impersonating” someone else (a common rhetorical </p>
<p>device; I discuss the question of persona again at 7:14–25). Certainly his </p>
<p>background in the law now informs his description, though he interprets </p>
<p>sexual. e evil impulse sometimes had sexual connotations (b. Sanh. 45a; b. Qidd. 30b), </p>
<p>but not always.</p>

<p>13. Bar Mitzvah is rst attested in the medieval period, although (on the analogy </p>
<p>of coming-of-age ceremonies in surrounding cultures, at which one assumed full legal </p>
<p>accountability, Gaius Inst. 3.208) something like it had probably long existed. It was from </p>
<p>this passage that Augustine inferred what became an age of accountability (Reasoner </p>
<p>2005: 71; in Judaism, cf. Gen. Rab. 26:1–2; 63:10). But some knowledge of law (e.g., hy-</p>
<p>perbolically, m. ’Abot 5:21) and moral consciousness (Musonius Rufus 4, p. 46.35–36) </p>
<p>were held to begin much earlier.</p>
