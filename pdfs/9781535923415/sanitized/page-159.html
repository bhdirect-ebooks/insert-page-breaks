<p>Israel’s Role and Salvation</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>Gentiles plays a role in this provocation (11:13–14).</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Perhaps he alludes</p>
<p>to the line of Jewish eschatological expectation in which Gentiles would </p>
<p>come to obey Israel’s God and king;</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>the Christian success at converting</p>
<p>Gentiles would show the rest of Israel that God’s eschatological blessing </p>
<p>was with Jesus’s movement.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Israel’s “transgression” (11:11–12) evokes that of the Gentile world </p>
<p>in Adam (5:15–20), but as Paul’s discussion of Adam featured reversal and </p>
<p>restoration, so does his discussion of Israel. In 11:12 Paul raises a point that </p>
<p>he will return to in 11:15, aer an important parenthetical digression in </p>
<p>11:13–14 (mentioned above). As Christ’s death produced reconciliation, </p>
<p>so did Israel’s loss (5:10; 11:15). But just as Christ’s risen life will produce </p>
<p>even greater benets than his death (5:9; 8:32), so also Israel’s restora-</p>
<p>tion will produce greater blessings than their failure (11:12).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Ultimately</p>
<p>it would bring about even the promised time of the resurrection of the </p>
<p>righteous (11:15; cf. 8:11), because this would be the consummation of </p>
<p>God’s plan (cf. Acts 3:19–21). Although Israel may not have cooperated </p>
<p>with the plan deliberately, Israel’s role in God’s plan thus mirrors on a </p>
<p>corporate level God’s activity for humanity in Christ.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>e turning of the</p>
<p>requisite portion of Israel to Jesus (versus the current smaller remnant) is </p>
<p>9. Paul’s apostleship to Gentiles may echo Jeremiah as a prophet to the nations (Jer </p>
<p>1:5; a passage Paul elsewhere echoes concerning his call, Gal 1:15).</p>
<p>10. Prophets envisioned Gentile repentance (e.g., Isa 19:19–25; Zech 2:11), subjuga-</p>
tion (Isa 60:12; Zeph 2:11), or destruction (Joel 3:19; Zeph 2:9–15); these diverse strands
<p>also appear in early Jewish eschatology (Donaldson 1997b: 52–74). Paul is apparently </p>
<p>able to piece together an end-time scenario only in Christological retrospect. is may </p>
<p>reverse some conventional expectations of Israel’s end-time repentance and restoration </p>
<p>leading to an ingathering of Gentiles (Allison 1985: 23–30; Sanders 1985: 93), though </p>
<p>Jewish sources lacked consensus as to whether these Gentiles were proselytes or merely </p>
<p>righteous (Donaldson 1990).</p>
<p>11. See this argument in Nanos 1996: 249–50. e collection (15:26–27), perhaps </p>
<p>evoking the eschatological oering of nations (Isa 60:5–16), may oer Jerusalem one </p>
<p>strategic expression of that success (Donaldson 1997b: 252).</p>
<p>12. Paul reinforces the point rhetorically in 11:12 by key nouns ending in -tōma, </p>
<p>-tēma, and -ōma, as well as four nouns beginning with p (paraptōma, ploutos [twice], </p>
<p>and plērōma).</p>
<p>13. Cf. also God not “sparing” Jesus (8:32) or Jewish branches (11:21). e parallel is </p>
<p>functional and limited: in context, Israel’s loss made reconciliation available for Gentiles </p>
<p>(the contextual sense of “the world” here), whereas Christ cooperated in his vicarious </p>
<p>sacrice.</p>
