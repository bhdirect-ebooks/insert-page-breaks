<p>Made Right by Trusting Christ</p>

<p>realistic apart from God (5:3). ey would thus boast not only in hope </p>
<p>directly (5:2), but in aiction that ultimately reinforced their hope (5:3; </p>
<p>cf. 8:24–25).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Paul employs the rousing rhetorical chain device of climax</p>
<p>(or sorites) in 5:3–5.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> Because aiction tests faith, it allows one to dem-</p>
<p>onstrate endurance, which is a necessary expression of faith for those </p>
<p>who would receive eternal life (2:7). (Paul most certainly did not regard </p>
<p>faith as saving if it failed to persevere in Christ; cf. 11:22; 1 Cor 9:27; </p>
<p>Gal 4:19; 5:4.) Aiction rst produces “tested character” (dokimē, 5:4); </p>
<p>one’s faith was shown to be genuine through the pressures of life, and the </p>
<p>genuineness and help of the Spirit (5:5) vindicate one’s hope of eternal life </p>
<p>(contrast adokimos, one who failed the test, in 1:28).</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Paul climaxes with hope (5:5). When one’s hope proved false, one </p>
<p>would be “ashamed”; the psalmist prayed that God would not let his hope </p>
<p>in God cause him such shame (Ps 119:116). e object of believers’ hope, </p>
<p>however (sharing God’s glory, Rom 5:2), would not put them to shame </p>
<p>(5:5; cf. 1:16; 9:33; 10:11). e basis of Paul’s condence in the future was </p>
the divine sign of proven character already within believers, namely, the
<p>Spirit attesting God’s love for them (5:5). Grammatically, “love of God” </p>
<p>could mean believers’ love for God or God’s love through them, but in </p>
<p>light of the following context it must mean God’s love for them (5:8). at </p>
<p>is, believers can be assured of the outcome of their suerings because </p>
<p>God’s Spirit within them points to Christ’s death for them,</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>as well as</p>
<p>resurrection hope (5:8–10). at the Spirit is a gi (5:5), in contrast to </p>
<p>some Jewish traditions,</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>also ts Paul’s theology of grace in this letter.</p>
<p>3. Some philosophers (Cicero Tusc. 2.7.17 [Epicurus]; Seneca Nat. 3, pref. 11–15, </p>
<p>esp. 12; Epictetus Disc. 3.8.6), apocalyptists (2 Bar. 52:6; cf. 1QS 10.15–17) and others </p>
<p>(Sir 2:4–5; Sipre Deut. 32.5.5) encouraged joy during suering. is applied especially to </p>
<p>persecution (2 Macc 6:30; Josephus J. W. 2.152).</p>
<p>4. E.g., Demosthenes Con. §19; Rhet. Her. 4.25.34–35; Demetrius Eloc. 5.270; </p>
<p>Maximus of Tyre Or. 16.3; Fronto Ad M. Caes. 1.6.4; Philostratus Ep. Apoll. 33; in Jewish </p>
<p>circles, Wis 6:17–20; Sipre Deut. 161.1.3; b. ‘Abod. Zar. 20b. Augustine recognized this </p>
<p>(Doctr. chr. 4.7.11, in Anderson 1999: 17–18).</p>
<p>5. Similar ideas appear in Jas 1:2–4; 1 Pet 1:6–7, possibly reecting a common early </p>
<p>Christian source (Davids 1982: 65–66).</p>
<p>6. e idea may include Christ sharing humanity’s suerings (cf. 8:3) as his body </p>
<p>(believers) should also share his (Phil 3:10), and the Spirit shares believers’ “groanings” </p>
<p>(Rom 8:26).</p>
