<p>Life in Christ and the Spirit</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>challenged attempts to succeed by merely human works (cf. the conjunc-</p>
<p>tion of law, esh and sin in 7:7–25); God is holy, and whatever works are </p>
<p>not born from God’s own Spirit cannot not satisfy his holiness.</p>
<p>Lest his audience misunderstand his point, Paul emphasizes that all </p>
<p>who belong to Christ have the Spirit dwelling in them, hence are “in the </p>
<p>[sphere of the] Spirit” rather than “in the [sphere of the] esh” (8:9). “In </p>
<p>the esh” here does not simply mean “in the body” (as in Gal 2:20), but </p>
<p>walking according to the esh (8:4–8, 12–13). All who are in Christ have </p>
<p>the Spirit (the “Spirit of Christ”),</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>hence they are able to live righteously</p>
<p>(8:2–4, 13–14).</p>
<p>In 8:10–11, Paul shows that believers can trust God for the raising of </p>
<p>their mortal bodies just as Abraham trusted in God’s resurrecting power </p>
<p>at work in his own “dead” body (4:19). eir bodies might be “dead” </p>
<p>(under sentence of death,</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>7:24) because of sin, but the Spirit is life (as</p>
<p>in 8:2, 6) because of the righteousness brought by Christ (5:17, 21) and </p>
<p>expressed in believers’ lives (8:4). (e contrast here is not between the </p>
<p>body and human spirit, but between depending on one’s physical, mortal </p>
<p>self and depending on God, as in 8:2–9.) Since the Spirit dwells in them </p>
<p>(as noted in 8:9), the Spirit through whom the Father raised Jesus would </p>
<p>also raise them (8:11; Ezek 37:9–14).</p>
<p>ose who follow the way of esh will perish, as esh does; by living </p>
<p>like the old way of esh has been crucied with Christ, however, believers </p>
<p>have condence that they will be raised (8:12–13; cf. 6:2–11; Gal 6:8).</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some ancient thinkers advocated that concern for bodily things tied the </p>
<p>soul down to mortality, but meditation on heavenly matters prepared the </p>
<p>soul for its life aer separation from the body. Paul may borrow such </p>
<p>language, but for him it is not the mind of itself (cf. Rom 8:5–7) but God’s </p>
<p>9. e label certainly implies Jesus’s deity (vs. later sources like Gen. Rab. 2:4, even </p>
Isa 11:2 refers to the divine Spirit; cf. Acts 16:7; Turner 1994: 436). Fee 1994a: 331, nds
<p>proto-Trinitarianism in 8:9–11. Some philosophers spoke of deity dwelling in humans </p>
<p>(Epictetus Disc. 1.14.13–14; 2.8.14), but sometimes in pantheistic terms; Paul’s imagery </p>
<p>is more Jewish (cf. e.g., T. Sim. 4:4).</p>
<p>10. For “dead” meaning about to die, cf. Gen 20:3; b. Pesah 110a; even “half-dead” </p>
<p>meant apparently or nearly dead (Luke 10:30; Callimachus Hymn. 6.59; Cornelius Nepos </p>
<p>Generals 4.5.4; Livy 23.15.8; Quintus Curtius 4.8.8; Suetonius Aug. 5).</p>
<p>11. In light of the preceding context of Romans (see 5:15–21), each person chooses </p>
<p>solidarity with Adam or with Christ: living according to the esh inherited from Adam </p>
<p>leads to the death that Adam introduced, whereas sharing the way of Christ’s obedient </p>
<p>death leads to resurrected eternal life. One puts to death bodily deeds by recognizing </p>
<p>one’s death with Christ (6:3–4, 11).</p>
