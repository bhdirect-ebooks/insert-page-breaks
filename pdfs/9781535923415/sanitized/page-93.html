<p>Made Right by Trusting Christ</p>

<p>would welcome those with Abraham’s faith as he welcomed Abraham.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul reads Scripture not only for covenantal history, but devotionally for </p>
<p>insight into and examples of a dynamic relationship with God.</p>
<p>Some have contrasted Abraham’s model of faith with fallen human-</p>
<p>ity’s apostasy in Romans 1:</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Rom 1:20–27 Rom 4:17–21</p>
<p>Humanity failed to recognize its </p>
<p>creator (1:20, 25)</p>
<p>Abraham trusted the creator </p>
<p>(4:17)</p>
<p>Humanity ignored God’s power </p>
<p>(1:20, using dunamis)</p>
<p>Abraham trusted God’s power </p>
<p>(4:21, using dunatos)</p>
<p>Humanity did not give God </p>
<p>glory (1:21)</p>
<p>Abraham gave God glory (4:20)</p>
<p>Humanity dishonored their </p>
<p>bodies (1:24)</p>
<p>Abraham found new strength in </p>
<p>his body (4:19)</p>
<p>Humanity used their bodies in </p>
<p>non-productive, same-sex rela-</p>
<p>tions (1:26–27)</p>
<p>Abraham and Sarah conceived a </p>
<p>child (4:19)—miraculously being </p>
<p>fruitful and multiplying</p>
<p>If Paul intends such a contrast, it would help prepare for the further </p>
<p>contrast between Abraham’s faith and Adamic humanity’s fallenness in </p>
<p>5:12–21.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>e armation that God raises the dead and creatively calls things </p>
<p>into being (4:17)</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>prepares for Paul’s explanation of the relevance of</p>
<p>Abraham’s “resurrection faith” for later believers (4:19, 24). Abraham </p>
<p>maintained hope despite the hopelessness of the situation (4:18), just </p>
<p>as believers must (5:2–5; 8:24–25). e nature of Abraham’s faith would </p>
<p>instruct Paul’s audience: whereas some of them were weak in faith </p>
<p>(14:1–2), Israel’s great ancestor Abraham was strong in faith (4:19–20); </p>
<p>15. Viewed in a broader context of the empire, Paul’s portrait oers a striking con-</p>
<p>trast to the imperial subjugation of “the nations” (see Lopez 2008).</p>
<p>16. Wright 2004: 78.</p>
<p>17. Abraham also pregures Christ in 5:12–21 in this respect, although I did not take </p>
<p>pistis Christou in 3:22 as a reference to Christ’s faith (parallel to Abraham’s), as some do.</p>
<p>18. is is the contemporary Jewish language of creation ex nihilo (Byrne 1996: 159–</p>
<p>60; Dunn 1988: vol. 1, 218; O’Neill 2002; 2 Bar. 21:4); Paul already appealed to creation </p>
<p>in Rom 1:20. God’s “calling” that formed his people and would form them in the future </p>
<p>appears in 8:30; 9:7, 12, 24–26. Mē onta appears also in 1 Cor 1:28.</p>
