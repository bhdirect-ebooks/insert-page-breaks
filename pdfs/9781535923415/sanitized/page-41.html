<p>Introduction</p>
<p>15</p>
Rome, believers do welcome him, probably without being divided in fac-
<p>tions (we cannot be sure whether the two delegations in Acts 28:15 reect </p>
<p>dierent house churches or perhaps simply dierent work schedules). So </p>
<p>far as one might gather from our limited reports of Nero’s persecution </p>
<p>(from a decade aer Jewish believers returned and perhaps six years aer </p>
<p>Paul composed this letter), Christians may have been at that time united </p>
<p>as a movement.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>e church must have been massive by that point;</p>
<p>Nero seems to have killed hundreds (or possibly thousands) of suspected </p>
<p>Christians (Tacitus Ann. 15.44), yet the church continued to ourish aer </p>
<p>his death a few years later.</p>
<p>Because Roman historians concentrated on Rome, their informa-</p>
<p>tion provides us more of an external framework for understanding this </p>
<p>church’s situation than we have for most of Paul’s letters. Depending on </p>
<p>one’s chronology of later events in Paul’s life, Paul writes between 55 and </p>
<p>58 CE (I incline toward the latter end of that spectrum)—hence one to </p>
<p>four years aer some of the Jewish believers expelled from Rome have </p>
<p>begun to return and six to nine years before Nero began slaughtering </p>
<p>Christians.</p>
<p>Other possible reasons for Paul writing Romans, not inherently </p>
<p>incompatible with this one, include building a relationship with this </p>
<p>Christian community that will provide the base for his planned mission </p>
<p>to Roman Spain (15:24, 28; emphasized, e.g., by Jewett). Paul’s failure to </p>
<p>visit them already is due to the very urgency of his mission to the un-</p>
<p>reached (15:20–22), which will compel him to move beyond them to the </p>
<p>west (15:23–24; cf. 1:13–14). Nevertheless, his Spanish mission and his </p>
<p>collection from Diaspora churches both relate to his ministry of building </p>
<p>a church that brings together Jew and Gentile, examples relevant to the </p>
<p>Roman church.</p>
<p>Paul certainly also summarizes his gospel, as many scholars point </p>
<p>out; nevertheless, as we have noted above, he is not simply giving a ran-</p>
<p>dom audience a random overview of it. It has practical implications for </p>
<p>that Paul sought to reconcile discord in the church (eodoret of Cyr Interp. Rom. on </p>
<p>15:33; Pelagius Comm. Rom. on 15:33; Bray 1998: 368) and that tensions over the law in-</p>
<p>form the dierences between the groups in Rom 14 (Ambrosiaster Commentary on Paul’s </p>
<p>Epistles on Rom 14:1; eodoret of Cyr Interp. Rom. on 14:1; though contrast Pseudo-</p>
<p>Constantius Holy Letter of St. Paul to the Romans on 14:1; Bray 1998: 337–38).</p>
29. Tacitus Ann. 15.44; cf. also the lack of concern over local division in 2 Tim, 1 Pet,
<p>or Heb 13:23–24; and the interest of 1 Clem. (e.g., 46.5–9) in Corinthian believers’ unity. </p>
<p>Persecution, of course, could have unied the church in any case.</p>
