<p>Introduction</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>culture of the urban eastern Empire was Greek, and that culture also </p>
<p>inuenced the Greek-speaking eastern immigrant community in Rome </p>
<p>(including most of its Jewish population) where the church had rst taken </p>
<p>root.</p>
<p>Good News of Salvation (1:16–17)</p>
<p>We must oer special, hence more detailed than usual, attention to 1:16–17. </p>
<p>Ancient writers oen (though not always) stated their themes and purpose </p>
<p>in a proposition before their main argument,</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>and most commentators of</p>
<p>recent centuries believe that Paul does so here. Commentators dier over </p>
<p>the central theme involved, though some proposals dominate only par-</p>
<p>ticular parts of the letter. Nevertheless, God’s righteousness (most explic-</p>
<p>itly through ch. 10), faith (most explicitly in chs. 1, 3–4, 10, and 14), and </p>
<p>the Jewish-Gentile issue (most explicitly in chs. 9–11) seem to pervade it. </p>
<p>Others oer the more general theme of the “gospel,” which integrates a </p>
<p>number of these factors (and for which, in Romans, God’s righteousness </p>
<p>is a key element).</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>at all these themes reect the language of prophetic</p>
<p>promises to Israel (Ps 98:2–3; Isa 51:4–5; 52:10)</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>reinforces Paul’s claim</p>
<p>that Scripture is the source of his gospel (1:1–2).</p>
<p>e gospel is the object of faith, and its subject is God’s Son (1:9), </p>
<p>Jesus Christ (15:19, 20; 16:25). Scholars propose various reasons why Paul </p>
<p>claims to be “unashamed” of the gospel. Certainly, interest in honor and </p>
<p>shame dominated ancient Mediterranean urban culture, including Rome, </p>
<p>and Paul’s message involved folly and weakness to a status-conscious cul-</p>
<p>Some texts add Romans as a third category (Juvenal Sat. 10.138; Quintilian Inst. 5.10.24; </p>
<p>as Greeks in Dionysius of Halicarnassus Ant. rom. 7.70.5); most included Jews in the </p>
<p>barbarian category (Strabo 16.2.38; Josephus J . W. 1.3; 4.45; but cf. Josephus Ant. 18.47).</p>
<p>33. E.g., Dionysius of Halicarnassus Lys. 17; Cicero Or. Brut. 40.137; idem Quinct. </p>
<p>10.36; Quintilian Inst. 4.4.1–8; Pliny the Elder Nat. 8.1.1; 18.1.1; Dio Chrysostom Or. </p>
<p>1.11; 38.5–6. Technically a “thesis” involved a hypothetical topic and a “hypothesis” </p>
<p>a concrete one (eon Progymn. 1.60 [cf. 2.91–104; 11.2–6, 240–43]; Hermogenes </p>
<p>Progymn. 11, On esis 24–26; Anderson 2000: 63–65). Paul’s might resemble a philo-</p>
<p>sophic thesis, though Stoics omitted these (Anderson 1999: 61, 241–42). Paul’s form may </p>
<p>dier from conventional rhetorical expectations (cf. Elliott 1990: 62–63, 82–83, doubting </p>
<p>that it is a thesis).</p>
<p>34. Moo 1996: 29, 32, 65; Jewett 2007: 135.</p>
<p>35. See especially Hays 1989: 36–38; idem 2005: 45, 94, 137, citing these texts, and </p>
<p>noting the texts to which Paul appeals in Rom 9:27–33; 11:26–27; 15:7–13, 21.</p>
