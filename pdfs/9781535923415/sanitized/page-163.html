<p>Israel’s Role and Salvation</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>Paul thus shared the expectation of biblical prophets and his con-</p>
<p>temporaries that his people would ultimately turn to God, inaugurating </p>
<p>the eschatological consummation.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>As commentators regularly point out,</p>
<p>Jewish sources can speak of “all Israel,” or “Israel as a whole,” being saved </p>
without assuming that this applies to every individual Jewish person.
<p>27</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nor did expectations of God delivering his people from the nations at </p>
<p>the end need to involve Jewish people from earlier generations who had </p>
<p>died. Given Paul’s insistent emphasis (including arguments from the ot) </p>
<p>in chapters 1–10 that salvation is only through faith in Christ, Paul can </p>
<p>hardly mean that God would provide Jewish people spiritual salvation </p>
<p>through a dierent means at the end, as some have argued.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>But does</p>
<p>Paul refer here only to deliverance from the oppression of the nations, </p>
<p>rather than spiritual salvation? e language in 11:26–27 could be so con-</p>
<p>strued if it were isolated, but not in this context. Aside from Paul’s usage </p>
<p>of the verb sōzō (“save”) in every other usage in Romans (5:9–10; 8:24; </p>
<p>10:9, 13), including with respect to Israel or Jewish persons in particular </p>
<p>(9:27; 11:14), Paul expects a reversal of Israel’s hardening against Christ </p>
<p>at this time.</p>
<p>is discussion leaves us with two primary options.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>First, when</p>
<p>Jesus as the deliverer returns, Israel as a whole, on learning of his identity, </p>
<p>will believe in him as their king truly appointed by God.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>e language</p>
<p>could certainly be so construed: Paul’s citation sounds like Jesus’s return </p>
<p>would precipitate their forgiveness (11:26–27). Although the Hebrew ver-</p>
<p>sion of Isa 59:20–21, which Paul here adapts, speaks of the redeemer com-</p>
<p>ing to Zion aer Israel turns from transgression, Paul’s wording (probably </p>
<p>based on blending the Greek version of the passage with Ps 14:7)</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>seems</p>
<p>to suggest the opposite.</p>
<p>26. See discussion above; cf. Acts 3:19–21.</p>
<p>27. m. Sanh. 10:1. Many would in fact be excluded (e.g., t. Sanh. 13:9–10).</p>
<p>28. For challenges to the popular, though minority, two-covenant view, see Das 2003: </p>
<p>96–106; Donaldson 1997b: 231–34.</p>
<p>29. Among others; and even here I am summarizing only briey arguments in a dis-</p>
<p>cussion that includes far more details and arguments than I have space to address.</p>
<p>30. For a short window of end-time opportunity for repentance, see e.g., 1 En. 50:2–5. </p>
<p>Justin Dial. 28 rejects this option for Israel.</p>
<p>31. In Greek, the deliverer will come “because of” Zion, and (as Paul has it) turn away </p>
<p>ungodliness from Jacob. From Ps 14:7 Paul has Israel’s “salvation” come “out of Zion.”</p>
