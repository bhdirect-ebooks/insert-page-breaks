<p>Romans 4:1–8</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>Abram’s faith was far from perfect: God had essentially promised both </p>
<p>land and seed (Gen 12:1–2), but even aer God assured Abram he would </p>
<p>receive both, he requested conrmation regarding the land (15:7–8), and </p>
<p>soon he and Sarai resorted to Hagar as a surrogate mother (16:2). Abram’s </p>
<p>faith is much greater years later when he oers up Isaac apparently with-</p>
<p>out question (22:2–3), but this initial, somewhat rudimentary faith is suf-</p>
<p>cient to be reckoned righteous, analogous to even those initially entering </p>
<p>the Christian faith.</p>
<p>Reading his key text for all it is worth, as midrashic expositors typi-</p>
<p>cally did, Paul contrasts the text’s words with his construction of righteous-</p>
<p>ness by obeying the law (what a Gentile Godfearer might feel necessary to </p>
<p>become a full convert to Judaism). God was not paying Abraham his due </p>
<p>for righteous deeds,</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>but “reckoning” his faith as if it were righteousness</p>
<p>(4:4–5); Paul highlights this term “reckon,” using it eleven times in this </p>
<p>chapter.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Paul’s claim that God “acquits” or “makes right the ungodly”</p>
<p>(4:5) is deliberatively provocative,</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>for it sounds like injustice (cf. Ex 23:7).</p>
<p>Paul backs up this claim, however, with his following citation. Jewish mi-</p>
<p>drash also linked together texts based on a common key term or phrase, </p>
<p>and Paul in 4:6–8 cites the favored state (“blessing,” in many translations) </p>
<p>of another whose behavior was “reckoned” by God’s favor rather than his </p>
<p>works (Ps 32:1–2). Having produced Abraham as a witness, he now cites </p>
<p>David, who was held to be the author of many psalms (especially in the </p>
<p>early Psalter). e psalmist had clearly sinned (Ps 32:3), yet God did not </p>
<p>“reckon” the sin to him.</p>
<p>Father Also of Gentiles Who Believe (4:9–12)</p>
<p>In 4:9–13 Paul returns to the issue that prompted (both in Romans and </p>
<p>Galatians) his heavy emphasis on being made right by faith: God puts </p>
<p>both Jews and Gentiles right with him by the same means. As we noted </p>
<p>above, Jewish people regarded Abraham as a model Gentile convert. Paul </p>
<p>3. Just “wages” for human behavior, in fact, are death (a dierent term in 6:23), </p>
<p>though the present term appears more positively in 1 Cor 3:8, 14; 9:17–18.</p>
<p>4. Cf. nding “favor” (charis, “grace”) in the Lord’s eyes in Gen 6:8; 18:3 (the lxx’s </p>
<p>rst two uses of the term).</p>
<p>5. e Greek terminology would sound even worse to those unfamiliar with the lxx </p>
<p>(Anderson [1999: 209] speaks of “lexical shock”).</p>
