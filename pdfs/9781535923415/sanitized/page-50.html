<p>Romans 1:8–15</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>promise his coming, but acknowledges that, while he plans to come, only </p>
<p>God knows whether future circumstances will fully permit it. is was </p>
<p>a common enough caveat (cf. 1 Cor 4:19; 16:7),</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>and Paul undoubtedly</p>
<p>thinks also of dangers he may face (Rom 15:31–32).</p>
<p>Paul did not found the Roman church, so he writes more as a brother </p>
<p>than as a father (contrast 1 Cor 4:15–16). us, he speaks unobtrusively </p>
<p>of “some” Spirit-inspired gi (1:11) and even insists that he and they will </p>
<p>be mutually “encouraged” by the other’s faith (1:12).</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Paul</p>
<p>knows that some are more gied for “exhortation” or “encouragement” </p>
<p>than others (12:8), and oers some such exhortations in this letter (12:1; </p>
<p>15:30; 16:17; all using a cognate of the verb for “encourage”). Certainly he </p>
<p>has already set about to encourage their “faith,” a key theme in Romans </p>
<p>(see comment on 1:17). His delay so far may have involved the temporary </p>
<p>prohibition of Jews settling there (cf. Acts 18:2), but, as his audience will </p>
<p>learn later, particularly involves the compelling priority of his mission to </p>
<p>unevangelized regions (15:19–23).</p>
<p>Still, Paul’s desire to visit them and encourage their faith (1:11–12) </p>
<p>ows, as apparently everything else in his life does, from his life’s mission </p>
<p>and purpose to reach the nations (1:5, 13–15). Paul treats this mission </p>
as a divine obligation (Rom 1:14; cf. 1 Cor 9:16–17)
<p>29</p>
<p>to reach the entire</p>
<p>range of “Gentiles” (1:13). ese included both Greeks and “barbarians” </p>
<p>(non-Greeks), both those whom Greeks considered wise and those they </p>
<p>considered foolish.</p>
<p>30</p>
(Greeks usually divided humanity into Greek and
<p>“barbarian”; mentioning both together meant “everyone.”</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>Romans and</p>
<p>Jews sometimes adopted these conventional labels.)</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>e dominant</p>
<p>27. A common caveat (e.g., Xenophon Hell. 2.4.17; Anab. 7.3.43; Epictetus Disc. </p>
<p>1.1.17; Josephus Ant. 2.333; 7.373; 20.267).</p>
<p>28. Reciprocity was a conventional expectation (Pliny Ep. 6.6.3; Statius Silvae 4.9; </p>
<p>Herman 2003; Highet 2003; Harrison 2003: 1, 15, 40–43, 50–53), but Paul expresses it in </p>
<p>terms expected for peers. For Paul, “spiritual” alludes to the Spirit (Fee 1994b: 28–31).</p>
<p>29. Ancient culture heavily emphasized obligation (cf. Rom 13:8; 15:1, 27), but the </p>
<p>expression was not limited to money and was oen used guratively (Musonius Rufus </p>
<p>17, p. 110.2–3; Dio Chrysostom Or. 44.4; Pliny Ep. 7.19.10), including for a debt to a </p>
<p>people (Cicero Quint. fratr. 1.1.9.28; Valerius Maximus 5.6. ext. 2).</p>
<p>30. On Greek disdain for barbarians’ lack of Greek education, see e.g., Diodorus </p>
<p>Siculus 1.2.6; Iamblichus V. P. 8.44.</p>
<p>31. E.g., Plato Alcib. 2.141C; Dio Chrysostom Or. 1.14; 9.12; Diodorus Siculus 1.4.5–</p>
<p>6; Dionysius of Halicarnassus Ant. rom. 3.11.10.</p>
<p>32. E.g., Cicero Inv. 1.24.35; Seneca Dial. 5.2.1; Josephus J . W. 5.17; idem Ant. 1.107. </p>
