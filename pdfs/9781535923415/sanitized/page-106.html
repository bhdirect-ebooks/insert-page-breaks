<p>Romans 6:1–11</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>Christ (6:6), represents who humanity was in Adam. ose who are in </p>
<p>Christ (in whom Adamic sin and death died) should no longer identify </p>
<p>themselves with the toxic legacy of fallen humanity, but rather with their </p>
<p>eternal identity secured by Christ.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Whereas all people are born in solidarity with Adam, solidarity with </p>
<p>Christ (hence his death and resurrection) begins through baptism into </p>
<p>him (6:3–4). Elsewhere Paul uses analogous language for baptism into </p>
<p>Moses (1 Cor 10:2), but baptism into Christ (Gal 3:27) or his body (1 Cor </p>
<p>12:13) seems a more organic metaphor involving transfer of not only al-</p>
<p>legiance but identity. Gentile converts to Judaism were immersed to wash </p>
<p>away their former Gentile impurities;</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>they were being initiated into a new</p>
<p>solidarity with the descendants of Abraham. Christians in such a context </p>
<p>would understand baptism as an act of conversion—not that the water </p>
<p>itself was holy or ecacious, but the act of obedience, demonstrating </p>
committed faith, oered an open demarcation of conversion. e divine
<p>side of conversion, however, initiates a new identity in the righteousness </p>
<p>and life initiated by Christ (Rom 5:18–19), a solidarity with Christ and </p>
<p>his body that includes sharing his death and burial to Adam as well as </p>
<p>new life.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>“Glory” (6:4) may evoke the resurrection hope (8:18, 21, 30), a body </p>
<p>raised in glory (1 Cor 15:40-43; Phil 3:21), resurrected by the Spirit (Rom </p>
<p>8:10–11; cf. 1 Cor 15:43–44). To “walk” (peripateō) in newness of life </p>
<p>evokes especially ot and early Jewish language for how one behaves; it is </p>
<p>identical here with walking properly (13:13), in love (14:15), and by the </p>
<p>Spirit (8:4; Gal 5:16). God’s Spirit provides the “newness” here that the law </p>
<p>could not provide (7:6), and this new identity and role in Christ contrasts </p>
<p>with the old person in Adam (6:6).</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>In 6:5 Paul indicates that believers</p>
<p>1. at “old person” alludes to Adam is clear also in other Pauline texts; thus in Eph </p>
<p>4:22–24 and Col 3:9–10 the “new person” is “created in God’s likeness,” as one would </p>
<p>expect in the new Adam (cf. Gen 1:26–27; 1 Cor 15:49).</p>
<p>2. See Epictetus Disc. 2.9.20; Juvenal Sat. 14.104; Sib. Or. 4.162–65; m. Pesah. 8:8; </p>
<p>other sources in Keener 2003b: 444–47. But Dunn (1988: 1:312) may be right to nd the </p>
<p>connection with Jesus’s death in Mark 10:38–39; Luke 12:50. Apparently relevant com-</p>
<p>parisons with “dying and rising” gods are signicantly later than Paul (see esp. Wagner </p>
<p>1967).</p>
<p>3. Just as identity in Adam transcended ethnicity, so does identity through baptism </p>
<p>into Christ (1 Cor 12:13; Gal 3:27–28).</p>
<p>4. Both ancient (e.g., Cyril of Alexandria Expl. Rom. on Rom 6:6) and modern (e.g., </p>
<p>Barth 1933: 197) commentators have recognized the connection here with Adam in the </p>
