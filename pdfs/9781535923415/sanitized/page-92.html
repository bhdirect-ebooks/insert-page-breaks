<p>Romans 4:13–25</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>e Promise through Faith (4:13–25)</p>
<p>Constructing again his antithesis between God’s original plan of prom-</p>
<p>ise and the Israel-specic law (Rom 4:13–15; cf. Gal 3:17–19), Paul </p>
<p>argues that if righteousness came by faith in the promise, the law (like </p>
<p>the circumcision that pregured it) is not what is needed to achieve it. </p>
<p>Various Jewish thinkers highlighted some biblical covenants while play-</p>
<p>ing down others, so Paul’s treatment of Moses’s law as a phase between </p>
<p>the Abrahamic promise and the new covenant was no more idiosyncratic </p>
<p>than some other treatments of the day.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Scripture promised Abraham</p>
<p>“the land” (haaretz), but in Hebrew this could mean either a specic land </p>
<p>or the earth, and by Paul’s day Jewish thinkers oen applied the promise </p>
<p>to the world as a whole, or even to inheriting the world to come.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>When</p>
<p>Paul speaks elsewhere of “inheriting,” as here (4:13), he oen uses it in the </p>
<p>idiom of the life of the coming age (Rom 8:17; 1 Cor 6:9–10; 15:50; Gal </p>
<p>5:21).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> Just as faith does not void law (Rom 3:31), so in 4:14 the law can-</p>
<p>not void faith and promise, which would also threaten Scripure and God’s </p>
<p>covenant (cf. Gal 3:17–18). For Paul, law’s function (in this context) is to </p>
<p>reveal failures to meet God’s standard rather than to reckon righteousness </p>
<p>(Rom 4:15).</p>
<p>In 4:16 Paul again returns to the key issue that motivates his argu-</p>
<p>ment: God’s one way of righteousness is not only for those who are of the </p>
<p>law (circumcised Israelites), but those who are of faith like Abraham—all </p>
<p>his spiritual descendants, both Jewish and Gentile.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>While not citing the</p>
<p>blessing of all nations in Abraham here (as in Gal 3:8; Gen 12:3; 18:18; </p>
<p>22:18), he cites Abraham as father of many nations (Gen 17:4–6; Rom </p>
<p>4:17). Although by itself that promise might mean father of Ishmaelites, </p>
<p>Edomites, Midianites and other ethnic descendants,</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Paul applies it to</p>
<p>Abraham’s spiritual heirs. Not all those physical descendants would really </p>
<p>inherit the covenant (Gen 17:7–8; cf. Rom 9:6–13, 25–29), whereas God </p>

<p>11. With many commentators (e.g., Byrne 1996: 157; cf. Jub. 32:19).</p>
<p>12. A common Jewish formulation (e.g., 1 En. 40:9; 4 Ezra 7:96; m. ’Abot 3:11; for </p>
<p>other sources, see e.g., Keener 1999: 167; and esp. Hester 1968).</p>
<p>13. Paul’s wording in 4:16 may allow for God’s continuing plan for ethnic Israel, an-</p>
<p>ticipating his later argument in Rom 11.</p>
<p>14. t. Ber. 1:12 applies it to being “father” of all humanity, perhaps in the sense of his </p>
<p>seed eventually ruling the world (cf. t. Ber. 1:13; Mek. Besh. 7.139–40).</p>
