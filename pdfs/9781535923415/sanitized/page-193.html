<p>Living the Christian Life</p>

<p>law (13:8–10). What the eater may intend as good (arming freedom in </p>
<p>Christ) may be viewed by others as evil (as disobeying Scripture, 14:16);</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> </p>
<p>although Paul may have thought some postmodern approaches today ex-</p>
<p>treme, he exhibits a tremendous pastoral sensitivity to dierent persons’ </p>
<p>motivations and perspectives.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Now Paul applies to Christians who do</p>
<p>not observe the law the very critique against strict Jews they may have </p>
<p>earlier applauded: in view of God’s judgment (14:10–12; cf. 2:3–5), they </p>
<p>must not judge (14:13; cf. 2:1), nor dare they let what they mean for good </p>
<p>cause ill speaking (blasphēmeō, 14:16; cf. 2:24).</p>
<p>In contrast to what does not matter very much, namely foods, Paul </p>
<p>comes in 14:17 (as he had in 14:6–8) to what really does matter: the true </p>
<p>righteousness he has been discussing throughout the letter (beginning in </p>
<p>1:17). It is only life empowered by God’s Spirit, not by the esh, that can </p>
<p>please God (8:2–13, especially 8:8). is life, rather than external rules, </p>
<p>fullls the hearts of the law (8:2–4). As in Galatians, this principle means </p>
<p>that merely external rules involving the esh cannot produce righteous-</p>
<p>ness; but the genuine purpose of God’s inspired law will never oppose the </p>
<p>life yielded to God’s Spirit (Gal 5:18–23). For Paul, peace seems especially </p>
<p>relational (Rom 14:19); joy at least oen occurs in the context of rela-</p>
<p>tionships (Rom 15:32; cf. 2 Cor 1:24; 2:3; 7:4, 13; 1 ess 2:19–20).</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>14:17, Paul understands God’s future reign (proclaimed by Jesus) as being </p>
<p>initially actualized in believers’ present lives through the Spirit.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>34. Others also warned against what others could construe as evil (see note on </p>
<p>12:17).</p>
<p>35. Scholars oen compare his approach to Stoic adiaphora, matters that are neither </p>
<p>intrinsically right nor wrong though they may tend toward or become either (Cicero </p>
<p>Fin. 3.15.50; Seneca Ep. Lucil. 82.10–14; Lucian Vit. auct. 21; Arius Didymus 2.7.7, p. </p>
<p>42.13–15; 2.7.7b, p. 44.14–33; 2.7.7g, p. 50.18–20; cf. Deming 2003: 384–88); cf. even </p>
<p>Epicurus in Diogenes Laertius 10.120. On motivation as a mitigating factor, see also </p>
<p>Philodemus On Criticism col. 9B.</p>
<p>36. Paul’s understanding of joy (as of the kingdom) reects a biblical and Jewish con-</p>
<p>text (see e.g., Halpern-Amaru 2005) more than a Stoic approach to emotion (on which, </p>
<p>see the essays in Sihvola and Engberg-Pedersen 1998; also Musonius Rufus 17, p. 108.7; </p>
<p>Dio Chrysostom Or. 25.1; Arius Didymus Epit. 2.7.5g, p. 32.4; 2.7.5k, p. 34.1; 2.7.6d, p. </p>
<p>40.1; 2.7.11g, p. 70.33–36; Engberg-Pedersen 2000: 73; idem 2003: 612), though there </p>
<p>may be some overlap on positive emotions.</p>
<p>37. See especially Cho 2005: 11, 52–109; cf. Hamilton 1957: 21–22; on the king-</p>
<p>dom in Paul, cf. also Donfried 2002: 233–52, esp. (regarding his use of Jesus’s message) </p>
<p>247–48, 250–51.</p>
