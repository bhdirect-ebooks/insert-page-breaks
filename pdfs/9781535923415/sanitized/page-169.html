<p>Living the Christian Life</p>
<p>143</p>
<p>to God, obedience and righteousness (6:13, 16, 19). He has also warned </p>
<p>against self-centered use of the body, without the rule of a mind enabled </p>
<p>by the Spirit (1:24; 6:6, 12; 7:24; 8:13). Now he will show that believers can </p>
<p>choose in their minds to present their bodies for the service of a greater </p>
<p>“body,” the body of Christ with whom they have been united (12:4–5).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When believers oer themselves as sacrices, they imitate Jesus, whose </p>
<p>death Paul has already presented as a bloody sacrice (3:25; 5:9; 8:3). </p>
<p>Nevertheless, believers oer themselves not only by sometimes being </p>
<p>martyred (cf. 8:36), but while alive (“living”).</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Believers oer up their bodies as a sacrice described by three adjec-</p>
<p>tives: “living,” “holy,” and “acceptable” or “pleasing.” Old Testament sac-</p>
<p>rices, involving inanimate things or slain animals, were not described </p>
<p>as living. Paul adapts the ot image of sacrice in a new direction as be-</p>
<p>lievers embrace Christ’s death even while living (6:2–11; Gal 2:20; Col </p>
<p>2:20—3:5), in accord with Jesus’s own teaching (Mark 8:34; Luke 9:23). </p>
<p>Oerings could, however, be described as “holy” to God (e.g., Lev 6:17, </p>
<p>25; 7:1; 10:12), and when Israel served God their oerings were “accept-</p>
<p>able” or “pleasing” to him (Ezra 6:10; Ps 20:3; Isa 56:7; Jer 6:20; Mal 3:4). </p>
<p>Paul describes this worship (latreia; cf. 9:4; 1 Chron 28:13) as “rational” </p>
<p>(logikos),</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>because it is with the mind that one chooses to present the</p>
<p>body to God’s service (see 12:2–3).</p>
<p>In 12:2 Paul indicates how the mind is instrumental in oering the </p>
<p>body (12:1). e renewed mind here contrasts with the depraved mind </p>
<p>Mic 6:6–8; Sir 35:1–3; Wis 3:6; 1QS 3.4, 6–9, 11; 8.3; 9.4–5; 10.6; 4Q403 frg. 1, col. 1.39–</p>
<p>40. Some Jews writing for Diaspora audiences accommodated Hellenistic philosophy by </p>
<p>rejecting animal sacrices (Sib. Or. 4.29–30; Philo Good Person 75). Nevertheless, the </p>
<p>image of spiritual sacrices was not itself inherently incompatible with literal ones (e.g., </p>
<p>Let. Aris. 170, 172, 234). Some pagan thinkers felt that deities desired less or no sacrice </p>
<p>(Dio Chrysostom Or. 13.35; Lucian Demon. 11; Maximus of Tyre Or. 2.1–2; Porphyry </p>
<p>Marc. 17.282–84; Pyth. Sent. 20); others mocked it altogether (e.g., Lucian Sacr.); a num-</p>
<p>ber rejected animal sacrice (Philostratus Vit. Apoll. 1.1, 31–32; 4.11; 5.25; 8.7; idem Ep. </p>
<p>Apoll. 27; Diogenes Laertius 8.1.22; Iamblichus V. P. 11.54; 18.85; 24.108; 28.150), though </p>
<p>society as a whole continued these practices.</p>
3. Cf. perhaps the divine mind that welcomes Jew and Gentile alike (11:34).
<p>4. Paul himself ministers as a priest, oering the Gentiles (to whom he is sent) as his </p>
<p>oering (15:16, also an “acceptable” one, albeit using a dierent term than in 12:1), but </p>
<p>again without blood.</p>
<p>5. While it can mean “spiritual” in the sense of “nonliteral” (perhaps 1 Pet 2:2), the </p>
<p>meaning in this context is clearly “rational” (cf. 12:2–3), its normal sense.</p>
