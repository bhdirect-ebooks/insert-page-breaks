<p>Made Right by Trusting Christ</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>Phil 1:28; 3:19; 1 ess 1:10; 2:16; 5:3, 9), including in this context (Rom </p>
<p>1:18; 2:5, 8, 12; 3:5; 4:15). e context of such wrath, however, highlights </p>
<p>the depth of God’s sacricial love here (apparently embodied in God’s </p>
<p>costly sacrice for humanity, again against many modern theological </p>
<p>conceptions).</p>
<p>Evoking 4:24–25, Paul indicates that hope is secure not only because </p>
<p>Christ died for us, but also because he rose (5:9–10). In 5:11 Paul may </p>
<p>summarize his point in this paragraph: believers can boast in God (see </p>
<p>comment on 5:2) because Jesus’s death has reconciled us to him.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>We also</p>
<p>boast in God alone because proven character and hope come by God’s </p>
<p>Spirit in our hearts rather than our own work (5:2–5). “rough our Lord </p>
<p>Jesus Christ” (5:1, 11) frames the paragraph.</p>
<p>Life in Christ and the Spirit (5:12—8:39)</p>
<p>Having addressed righteousness by dependence on Christ’s work in </p>
<p>1:17—5:11, Paul now turns to the new life involved in being identied </p>
<p>with Christ (5:12—6:11) and in the Spirit’s indwelling (8:1–39). It is this </p>
<p>new life in union with God, rather than mere human knowledge about </p>
<p>God’s righteous law (7:1–25), that produces true righteousness.</p>
<p>Because Paul oen transitions from one thought to the next rather </p>
<p>than following a neat hierarchical outline, scholars oen debate whether </p>
<p>Romans 5 belongs with the previous section on justication (1:16—4:25) </p>
<p>or the following one on life (6:1—8:39).</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>In 5:1–11, however, Paul is</p>
<p>applying to his audience principles exemplied by Abraham’s model in </p>
<p>chapter 4; in 5:12–21, Paul shis from the gure of Abraham to the gure </p>
<p>of Adam, and the new life in chapter 6 follows directly from 5:12–21. </p>
<p>us, with a minority of scholars (e.g., Talbert), I believe that it might be </p>
<p>simplest to assign 5:1–11 to the previous section and 5:12–21 to the fol-</p>
lowing one. At the very least, the possibility of such a division invites us
<p>to take into account the importance of both the preceding and following </p>
<p>contexts.</p>
<p>12. Cf. reconciliation in 2 Macc 5:20; for reconciliation and atonement, see Plutarch </p>
<p>es.15.1; especially Fitzgerald 2001: 243, 252–53 (the most distinctive aspect here being </p>
<p>that the oended party oers the payment, Fitzgerald 2001: 255). For reconciliation and </p>
<p>friendship, see Fitzgerald 2003: 334–37.</p>
<p>13. For surveys of views, see e.g., Fitzmyer 1993: 96–97; Moo 1996: 291. Because Paul </p>
<p>transitions gradually between points, scholars naturally nd connections with both the </p>
<p>preceding and following material.</p>
