<p>to stumble. Although Paul regarded circumcision as too much to ask of </p>
<p>Gentiles, for Gentiles to accommodate Jewish food tastes in mixed com-</p>
<p>pany was a minimal sacrice for the objective of unity in Christ’s body.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Christ oered the example of this readiness to forgo pleasing himself; in </p>
<p>15:3 Paul cites Ps 69:9 from a psalm of a righteous suerer, applied par </p>
<p>excellence to Jesus (cf. John 2:17 for a dierent part of the same verse; Matt </p>
<p>27:34 for Ps 69:21). Here Jesus suers on behalf of God, oering a model </p>
<p>of laying down one’s desires to serve others.</p>
<p>Explaining why he has cited Ps 69:9 for hortatory purposes, Paul </p>
<p>notes that Scripture was written to teach believers (15:4). He believed that </p>
<p>the events actually happened partly for later generations to learn from (1 </p>
<p>Cor 10:6, 11), but here emphasizes more precisely that they were written </p>
<p>for this purpose. He does not treat them as symbols of later realities, but </p>
<p>indicates that one may learn by analogy from examples. e Scriptures </p>
<p>were meant to sustain hope through “endurance” (nrsv “steadfastness”) </p>
<p>and “encouragement” (Rom 15:4).</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> Paul has earlier emphasized “endur-</p>
<p>ance” (2:7; 12:12) and its role in serving hope (5:3–4; 8:25); the term for </p>
<p>“encouragement” here includes also “exhortation” (as in 12:8). God gives </p>
<p>endurance and encouragement (15:5) through Scripture (15:4), and Paul </p>
<p>prays that God will give them the same mind toward one another (15:5; </p>
<p>cf. comment on this exhortation in 12:16).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>at is, Paul’s exhortations</p>
<p>from Scripture throughout this letter have been to help them endure the </p>
<p>tensions and to come into unity.</p>
<p>As Jesus is the example for not seeking one’s own interests (15:3), he </p>
<p>is also the example for seeking this unity: they should have the same mind </p>
<p>“according to [the standard of] Christ Jesus” (15:5; cf. Phil 2:1–11, esp. </p>
<p>2:2–5; see comment on 12:16). Believers may with united voice glorify </p>
<p>the Father (15:6) just as Jesus prayed to the Father in 15:3 (and establishes </p>
<p>Gentiles’ praise in 15:9–12). Believers should again follow Jesus’s example </p>
<p>by accepting one another as he accepted all of them (15:7). is expec-</p>
<p>tation climaxes the section’s opening exhortation to accept one another </p>
<p>(14:1) because of God’s acceptance (14:3). at Christ accepted believers </p>
<p>4. Paul disapproved “pleasing” people at the expense of disobeying God (Gal 1:10; 1 </p>
<p>ess 2:4); but he was ready to “please” people strategically for their spiritual welfare (1 </p>
<p>Cor 10:33).</p>
<p>5. On comfort through Scripture, see e.g., 2 Macc 15:9; on hope, e.g., T. Jud. 26:1.</p>
<p>6. Addressed grammatically to them but implicitly to God, this is a blessing or “wish-</p>
<p>prayer” (see Wiles 1974: 25–29, 71).</p>
