<p>Israel’s Role and Salvation</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>Yet not only does God show mercy sovereignly, but he also hardens </p>
<p>sovereignly (Rom 9:17–18). In Exod 9:16</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>God had shown mercy in not</p>
<p>destroying Egypt (cf. Exod 9:15) so he could continue to reveal his power </p>
<p>in them and make his name known. Paul adapts the wording; God had </p>
<p>not only spared Pharaoh, but “raised him up,” which could develop the </p>
<p>idea beyond preservation (it was common lxx language for awakening), </p>
<p>or could refer to God even stirring Pharaoh to his mad course (cf. the </p>
<p>lxx verb in Jer 6:22; 50:41; 51:1; Hab 1:6). Paul reads this claim in the </p>
<p>larger context of Exodus’s theology of God’s sovereignty: God also hard-</p>
<p>ens Pharaoh to show his glory.</p>
<p>We should keep in mind that God hardening people is not a perva-</p>
<p>sive Pauline theme (though it does appear), hence it should be balanced </p>
<p>with other aspects of his theology and of Scripture. His very example of </p>
<p>God judging a stubborn Pharaoh could also be used, for example, to teach </p>
<p>God’s concern that Gentiles know of him: God kept hardening Pharaoh’s </p>
<p>heart so God’s judgments would notify Egypt that he was the Lord (Exod </p>
<p>7:5, 17; 14:4, 18), just as he wanted to show Israel (Exod 6:7; 10:2; 16:6, </p>
<p>12). Likewise, Paul believes that God gave the world over to its own moral </p>
<p>depravity (Rom 1:24, 26, 28), and could have inferred an analogous les-</p>
<p>son from Exodus. It is said that Pharaoh hardened his own heart (Exod </p>
<p>8:15, 32; 9:34; 1 Sam 6:6) as well as that God hardened it (Exod 9:12; </p>
<p>10:1, 20, 27; 11:10; 14:8; predicted in 4:21; 7:3; 14:4; cf. the passive “was </p>
<p>hardened” in 7:13, 22; 8:19; 9:7, 35).</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Apparently God chose this Pharaoh</p>
<p>not so that an honorable man would become stubborn but so that God </p>
<p>would judge a wicked leader, revealing God’s power. Certainly Paul shares </p>
<p>the text’s interest in the honor of God’s name throughout the world (Rom </p>
<p>1:5; 2:24).</p>
<p>But Paul emphasizes the appropriate side of “hardening” theology to </p>
<p>prepare for a shocking point: the God who shows mercy as he wills is also </p>
<p>the God who can harden as he wills, and he has hardened his own people. </p>
<p>As God hardened the Gentile Pharaoh to deliver Israel and reveal his </p>
<p>14. God now speaks to Pharaoh (Rom 9:17) as he had to Moses (9:15), perhaps con-</p>
<p>tinuing in some sense earlier contrasts between God’s servant and a “Gentile” (between </p>
<p>Ishmael and Isaac, Esau and Jacob). For “Scripture” personied speaking, or identied </p>
<p>with God’s voice, see e.g., Matt 19:5; m. Sot. 9:6; t. Sot. 12:2; Mek. Shir. 6; 1QM 11.5–6; </p>
<p>probable reading of 4Q158 f1 2.11–13.</p>
<p>15. As noted also in Augustine Exp. prop. Rom. 62 (though he later changed; Reasoner </p>
<p>2005: 106).</p>
