<p>Romans 3:21–31</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>Jesus as the place where forgiven humanity can meet God. Crucixion </p>
<p>was not always bloody, and the Gospels use “blood” not to describe the </p>
<p>event itself but its signicance.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>In an image related to the tabernacle,</p>
<p>“blood” likely connotes sacricial death, as elsewhere in early Christian </p>
<p>meditation on the point of Jesus’s death, both regarding atonement and </p>
<p>purication (1 Pet 1:2, 19; 1 John 1:7).</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> Paul’s image would be intelli-</p>
<p>gible; an extant Hellenistic Jewish source suggests that some others used </p>
<p>hilastērion guratively, as Paul did. For them, it was a gure for atone-</p>
<p>ment itself, specically the atonement oered by a human death turning </p>
<p>away God’s wrath from the people (4 Macc 17:22).</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>In a context replete</p>
<p>with mentions of God’s wrath (Rom 1:18; 2:5, 8; 3:5; 4:15), this function is </p>
<p>signicant: Jesus’s blood elsewhere turns away God’s anger (5:9–10) and </p>
<p>his death may be sacricial in 8:3.</p>
<p>Previously God “passed over” his people’s sins rather than punishing </p>
<p>them justly (paresis in 3:25 means “postponing” or “neglecting” punish-</p>
<p>ment),</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> but now he was revealing or proving his righteousness by show-</p>
<p>ing that he was both righteous and the one who would put his people </p>
<p>right with him (his people here being those with Jesus-faith). If we take </p>
<p>the two elements as contrasts, God was just to punish sin, yet put his </p>
<p>people right with him by executing the sentence on another (Jesus’s aton-</p>
<p>ing death being viewed like that of martyrs in Maccabean literature).</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>they are coordinated, God’s righteousness includes covenant faithfulness </p>
<p>to put people right with him (see comment on 1:17). Because God’s righ-</p>
<p>probably evoked here (see Rom 5:9; 8:3; cf. Gosling 2001).</p>
<p>33. e covenant sacrice (Mark 14:24) and blood guilt (Matt 23:35/Luke </p>
<p>11:50–51).</p>
<p>34. For Jesus’s sacricial blood inaugurating a covenant, in light of Exod 24:5, 8, see 1 </p>
<p>Cor 11:25; Mark 14:24; Heb 9:18–20; 10:29; 12:24; 13:20.</p>
<p>35. is image also connects with ransom (4 Macc 17:21), hence perhaps with “re-</p>
<p>demption” (Rom 3:24); without this term, martyr-atonement also appears in 2 Macc </p>
<p>7:37–38; 4 Macc 6:27–29. Scholars also point to Josephus Ant. 16.182; Gen 6:16 Symm. </p>
<p>While less compelling, they reinforce the observation that the lxx term’s cognates had </p>
<p>inuenced its gurative application.</p>
<p>36. For God overlooking sins, at least temporarily, cf. Wis 11:23; Acts 14:16; 17:30.</p>
<p>37. When not enforced, laws could be said to lose their validity (Aeschines Tim. 36, </p>
<p>192). Later rabbis portrayed God’s attributes of justice and mercy competing (Urbach </p>
<p>1979: 1:448–61; cf. Jas 2:13); Paul may resolve such tension here.</p>
