<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Because Romans is the rst Pauline letter in our NT canon, I begin with </p>
<p>an introduction that may shed some light on the letters in general, al-</p>
<p>though it is designed with Romans particularly in mind.</p>
<p>Reading Letters</p>
<p>In the past, some scholars made much of the dierence between “letters” </p>
<p>and “epistles,” placing Paul’s in the former category to show their proxim-</p>
<p>ity to most surviving ancient letters (from Egyptian papyri) rather than </p>
<p>literary letters. While Paul did not belong to the elite circles of leisured </p>
<p>letter writers like Cicero or Pliny, he did not simply compose his major </p>
<p>letters, like Romans, o the top of his head. Given the time necessary to </p>
<p>take normal dictation in antiquity (shorthand being unavailable), Paul </p>
<p>may have taken over eleven hours to dictate this letter to Tertius, its scribe </p>
<p>(Rom 16:22).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Since such a major undertaking probably involved more</p>
<p>than one dra (and Paul could draw on his preaching experience), the </p>
<p>nal dra may have taken less than this estimate, but the total time in-</p>
<p>vested in the letter was probably greater. Given the cost of papyrus and </p>
<p>of the labor required (though Tertius, a believer, might have donated </p>
<p>his services), one scholar estimates the cost of Romans at 20.68 denarii, </p>
<p>which he calculates as roughly $2275 in recent US currency.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>In other</p>
<p>words, Paul did not simply oer this project as an aerthought; Romans </p>
<p>is a carefully premeditated work.</p>
<p>As we shall note below, Romans is no ordinary letter; it is a sophis-</p>
<p>ticated argument. e average ancient papyrus letter was 87 words; the </p>
<p>orator Cicero was more long-winded, averaging 295 words (with as many </p>
<p>as 2530 words); and the philosopher Seneca averaged 995 words (with as </p>
<p>many as 4134). e extant letters attributed to Paul average 2495 words, </p>
