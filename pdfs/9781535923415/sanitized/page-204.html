<p>Romans 15:14–33</p>
<p>178</p>
<p>in Paul’s day and the believers would likely have counted it a special privi-</p>
<p>lege to partner with an important apostle in this way—they might well </p>
<p>do more than he requests here.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>Paul’s expectation of nancial support</p>
<p>at least for his voyage to Spain does not demand more of believers in </p>
<p>Rome than the mission demands elsewhere (cf. the signicant oerings </p>
<p>in 15:25–27). at he frames the mission to Jerusalem with his Roman </p>
<p>and Spanish plans (15:24, 28) suggests that whereas the eastern church </p>
<p>has covered the Jerusalem oering (though Roman Gentiles, too, should </p>
<p>have been obligated, 15:27), the Roman believers can sponsor a dierent, </p>
<p>groundbreaking ministry of the apostle.</p>
<p>Eager as Paul is to visit the western Mediterranean, he must rst </p>
<p>return to Jerusalem (15:25) where his mission began (15:19). He does </p>
<p>not expect this nal mission in the east (15:25–27) to delay him long un-</p>
<p>less he meets trouble there, but is concerned that trouble is a possibility </p>
<p>(15:30–32).</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Paul’s mission of laying foundations for the unevangelized</p>
<p>(15:20) coheres with his mission of keeping the new Diaspora churches </p>
<p>in spiritual unity with the Jerusalem church despite all their dierences.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It also provides a model for the unity of the culturally dierent Jewish </p>
<p>and Gentile believers in Rome.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>If Paul, apostle to the Gentiles (11:13;</p>
<p>15:18–29), serves needs in Jerusalem, then Gentile believers more gener-</p>
<p>ally should look out for their Jewish siblings in Christ (cf. 11:18; probably </p>
<p>relevant to law-observers in 15:1). Moreover, and in the immediate con-</p>
<p>text, if the eastern churches have supported Paul’s Jerusalem mission, the </p>
<p>believers in Rome should support his Spanish mission, which is in their </p>
<p>direct sphere of cultural inuence (15:24, 28). Paul’s report also implies </p>
<p>that the eastern churches trust him nancially (a reputation for integrity </p>
<p>that Paul was careful to maintain, 1 Cor 16:3–4; 2 Cor 8:19–21).</p>
<p>34. On eagerness to entertain respected guests, cf. e.g., Euripides Alc. 1039–41; Cicero </p>
<p>Att. 12.36; Plutarch Cic. 32.1.</p>
<p>35. We know from Acts 21:27—26:32, and infer from his subsequent letters and ex-</p>
<p>ecution in Rome, that unfortunately trouble occurred.</p>
<p>36. Many connect the collection with Paul’s ethnic universalism (see e.g., Park 2003: </p>
<p>65–67) and continuing respect for the Jerusalem church (Hill 1992: 173–78, against F. </p>
<p>C. Baur).</p>
<p>37. Incidentally, it united Diaspora churches in a common mission (Harrison 2003: </p>
<p>308). ough Paul names provinces, people thought primarily in terms of cities (Judge </p>
<p>1960: 20); Christians’ later trans-geographic network, perhaps growing from Judaism’s </p>
<p>“trans-nationalism” (cf. Meeks and Wilken 1978: 27), was highly distinctive (Wilken </p>
<p>1998: 43) and may have disturbed some Roman authorities.</p>
