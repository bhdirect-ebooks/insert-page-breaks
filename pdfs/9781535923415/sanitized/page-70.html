<p>Romans 2:1–16</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>those with the law of Moses and those with only natural law (2:12–15)—</p>
<p>and he will hold those with greater revelation more accountable! Judging </p>
<p>people in accordance with their deeds was one way of speaking of God’s </p>
<p>impartiality;</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> the surprise is that, instead of God’s own people being fa-</p>
<p>vored, they are judged more strictly because they have a fuller knowledge </p>
<p>of right and wrong (2:12–15; 3:20; 7:7–11; cf. Amos 3:2).</p>
<p>In view of the lostness of all humanity in this section (3:9, 23), schol-</p>
<p>ars debate whether those who do good works for eternal life</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>represent</p>
<p>a real but small class of people (the way some Jewish people thought of </p>
<p>“righteous Gentiles”); a hypothetical class of people (posited perhaps </p>
<p>for rhetorical purposes) (cf. 10:5; Gal 3:11);</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>or Christians (cf. 2:29).</p>
<p>Especially both latter proposals may have some merit: in principle it is </p>
<p>the righteous who will be saved, and in practice it is those who are in </p>
<p>Christ who can live righteously (8:2–4). Yet Paul’s focus at this point is </p>
<p>not on Christians, but on the principle of God’s ethnic impartiality (also </p>
<p>the point of all humanity being under sin in 3:9). Paul is digressing on </p>
<p>the point precisely to explain how those who fancied themselves morally </p>
<p>superior were treasuring up wrath for themselves (2:5). It served Paul’s </p>
<p>point to note that Gentiles would at least sometimes do morally right </p>
<p>actions, whereas Jews would sometimes not do them. Nevertheless, apart </p>
<p>from Christ, the natural law of conscience innate in human beings func-</p>
<p>tions like the external law of Moses, identifying sin but not transforming </p>
<p>people to be righteous (2:14–15). Comparing the passage with other pas-</p>
<p>sages in Romans allows us to see that while it focuses on the potential </p>
<p>righteousness of any person, Paul would only aver that those transformed </p>
<p>by Christ would live thus:</p>
<p>between Jew and Gentile is a theme of Romans (cf. 3:30).</p>
<p>9. E.g., Sir 16:12; Paul here echoes Ps 62:12; Prov 24:12.</p>
<p>10. For one synthesis of how judgment by works and justication only by faith t in </p>
<p>Paul’s concern for reaching Gentiles, see insightfully Boers 1994: 221–24. ose with the </p>
<p>law within fulll righteousness (8:2–4; Gathercole 2002: 223), and are still evaluated for </p>
<p>works (14:10; 2 Cor 5:10).</p>
<p>11. One could debate whether his rhetoric is hypothetical here or hyperbolic in </p>
3:9–23 (where he seems to place every individual under sin), his objective being merely
<p>to show that both groups (Jew and Gentile) need Christ. But it is doubtful that he thought </p>
<p>of morally sentient adults who had not sinned, of Adamites who did not need to be in </p>
<p>Christ (5:12–21), or of people of esh who did not need the Spirit for life (8:2–10).</p>
