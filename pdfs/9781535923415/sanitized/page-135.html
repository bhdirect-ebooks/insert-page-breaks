<p>Life in Christ and the Spirit</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>hand (8:3), the title applied in a special way aer the resurrection (cf. </p>
<p>1:4; Acts 13:33). e resurrection of believers will also display them as </p>
<p>God’s children in a new way (8:21–23); as the rst to rise (1 Cor 15:20, </p>
<p>23), Jesus was the “rstborn” (Rom 8:29; cf. Col 1:18; Heb 1:6; Rev 1:5), </p>
<p>also a designation of priority in honor. In conjunction with the context of </p>
<p>present suerings, being “conformed” to Jesus’s image involves a present </p>
<p>process through, among other things, sharing Christ’s suering (cf. 12:2; </p>
<p>2 Cor 3:18; Phil 3:10).</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is the future consummation of</p>
<p>that conforming, achieved with the glorication of the body, that Paul </p>
<p>emphasizes in 8:29 (cf. 1 Cor 15:49; Phil 3:21). Like Wisdom or the “lo-</p>
<p>gos” in Hellenistic Judaism, Jesus is God’s chief image through which God </p>
<p>can stamp his image on others (cf. 2 Cor 4:4).</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>But Jesus is also the new</p>
Adam, restoring the divine image marred in Adam (cf. Gen 1:26–27).
<p>Glorication (Rom 8:30) also involves restoration of lost glory (cf. 3:23). </p>
<p>In both cases, the description suggests that the restoration is greater than </p>
<p>the fall (cf. 5:15–20).</p>
<p>When modern readers encounter terms like “chose” and “predes-</p>
<p>tine” (Rom 8:29–30) we tend to read them in light of later theological </p>
<p>debates, such as the Greek fathers’ defense of free will against fatalism, </p>
<p>Augustine’s defense of God’s sovereign grace against Pelagius, or the de-</p>
<p>bates of the Reformation era.</p>

<p>Paul’s own audience would think of Israel</p>
43. e divine likeness in humanity could be intelligible to some philosophers (Seneca
<p>Dial. 1.1.5; Musonius Rufus 17, p. 108.15–16; Diogenes Laertius 6.2.51; Porphyry Marc. </p>
<p>13.233–34; 16.267; 26.413–14, 419–20; Iamblichus Myst. 7.4), but given Paul’s many </p>
<p>explicit biblical quotations, the dominant and nearest source Paul shares with his audi-</p>
<p>ence would be Scripture (see esp. Rom 5:12–21; cf. Sir 17:3; Wis 2:23; Philo Creation </p>
<p>69; 4 Ezra 8:44; L.A.E. 37:3; Apoc. Mos. 10:3; 33:5; T. Naph. 2:5; m. ’Abot 3:15). “Image” </p>
<p>also connoted sonship (Gen 5:1–3; cf. Seneca Dial. 1.1.5; Menander Rhetor 2.6, 407.9; </p>
<p>Philostratus Hrk. 52.2; Gregory of Nazianzus eo. Or. 4.20).</p>
<p>44. See Wis 7:26; Philo Creation 26; idem Spec. Laws 3.207; idem Planting 18; idem </p>
<p>Dreams 2.45. For the coalescing of this image with the rst man, see Philo Alleg. Interp. </p>
<p>1.43; for the stamping of the rst man’s image on others, see m. Sanh. 4:5; b. Sanh. 38a.</p>
<p>45. Most ancient Jewish authors did not pit God’s sovereignty against human choice </p>
<p>(cf. e.g., Josephus J . W. 2.162–63; idem Ant. 18.13; m. ’Abot 3:16); a sovereign God could </p>
<p>sovereignly allow much choice and still accomplish his purposes. Cf. also the balance in, </p>
<p>e.g., Augustine Simpl. 10; Jerome Pelag. 1.5; for the change in Augustine’s position, see </p>
<p>e.g., Reasoner 2005: 97–100. In Scripture, God works in and around choices (see e.g., </p>
<p>Exod 13:17; 1 Sam 9:8, 16). If God did not sovereignly make some choice possible, one </p>
<p>might expect all people to follow his requirements and moral will; yet environment and </p>
<p>genetics determine much, and any degree of choice might be impossible without God </p>
<p>sovereignly enabling it.</p>
