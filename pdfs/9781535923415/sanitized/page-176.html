<p>ment of getting along with outsiders. It reects a popular ethic,</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>yet also</p>
<p>prepares Paul’s audience for his emphasis on respecting stricter opinions </p>
<p>among fellow believers, when possible, in 14:13–21.</p>
<p>In contrast to some Judean nationalists, some Pharisees (vindicated </p>
<p>by the outcome of the war in 66–70 that began less than a decade later) </p>
<p>would have shared Paul’s emphasis on living at peace with others (12:18).</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul, like many other thinkers, intends it as a principle for relationships </p>
more generally, including regarding issues of division in the Roman
<p>church (14:17, 19; 15:13, 33). Here, however, the context’s emphasis lies </p>
<p>on relations with nonbelievers. His “insofar as you are able” recognizes </p>
<p>that believers cannot control how others act toward them; a few years </p>
<p>later, in fact, Christians’ enemies in Rome had many of them killed.</p>
<p>One reason to avoid avenging oneself was that God would avenge </p>
<p>those who le the matter with him (12:19).</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> (A song I learned while serv-</p>
<p>ing in some African-American churches summarizes this basic sentiment: </p>
<p>“If I hold my peace, let the Lord ght my battles, victory, victory shall </p>
<p>be mine!”) Paul backs up his claim with a quotation from Deut 32:35, a </p>
<p>context he has used heavily in Romans.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>In 12:20 Paul quotes Prov 25:21–22 (which goes on to add that </p>
<p>the Lord will reward the person who shows kindness to their enemy).</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Scholars debate whether burning coals on an enemy’s head in 12:20 refers </p>
<p>to the enemy’s conversion or embarrassment (the “positive” approach </p>
<p>held by Origen, Augustine, Jerome and others) or to their destruction </p>
<p>(the “negative” approach held by John Chrysostom). Many commenta-</p>
<p>tors prefer the former approach, and it is possible to construe 12:21 in </p>
<p>terms of winning over enemies.</p>
