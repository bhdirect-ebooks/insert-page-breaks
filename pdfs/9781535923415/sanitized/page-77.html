<p>Romans 3</p>
<p>Made Right by Trusting Christ (1:18—5:11), cont.</p>
<p>God’s Faithfulness (3:1–8)</p>
<p>It is not God who has broken the covenant, Paul insists (3:1–8). Ancient </p>
<p>writers oen used rhetorical questions, and some of these, like some of </p>
<p>the questions here, could be objections supplied by an imaginary in-</p>
<p>terlocutor, a straw man to be refuted.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>e interlocutor here raises the</p>
<p>obvious objection to Paul’s argument: if ethnic Jewishness and outward </p>
<p>circumcision did not guarantee covenant membership (2:25–29), what </p>
<p>was the value of these matters (3:1)?</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Paul replies that Israel’s benet is</p>
<p>a greater opportunity, although this opportunity also entailed (as Paul </p>
<p>has been noting, 1:16; 2:9–10) greater responsibility. e opportunity </p>
<p>involved their role in salvation history (a role Paul continues to assign to </p>
<p>ethnic Israel, 9:4–5; 11:12, 15) and their greater access to God’s clearest </p>
<p>revelation in Scripture (an access today shared also with Christians). God </p>
<p>“entrusted” them with his oracles (3:2). (Although Paul says “rst” in 3:2, </p>
<p>he does not get beyond this initial benet here [cf. 1:8]; many think he </p>
<p>1. Scholars debate exactly which rhetorical questions imply an interlocutor; indeed, </p>
<p>one could simply anticipate potential objections (e.g., Rhet. Alex. 18, 1432b.11—1433b.16; </p>
<p>36, 1442b.4–6; Cicero Rosc. Amer. 18.52) or answer one’s own questions (Cicero De or. </p>
<p>40.137). ough “What, then?” (Rom 3:1, 9) could belong to interlocution (e.g., Cicero </p>
<p>Tusc. 3.20.46; Seneca Dial. 3.6.1; 3.8.7), it sometimes oered a summation or advanc-</p>
<p>ing of the argument (e.g., Musonius Rufus 5, p. 50.21; Dio Chrysostom Or. 31.55, 60; </p>
<p>Menander Rhetor 2.1–2, 376.4). Nevertheless, we need not doubt the presence of an </p>
<p>interlocutor in at least some of them. ere can be no question that ancient sources used </p>
<p>unmarked interlocutors as well as marked ones (e.g., Cicero Sull. 19.54—20.56; 22.62; </p>
<p>idem Scaur. 9.18; 18.41; idem Phil. 3.6.15, 16; Virgil Aen. 10.67; Dio Chrysostom Or. 23; </p>
<p>31.12). See here e.g., Stowers 1994: 162–66, 232; idem 1984: 707–22.</p>
<p>2. Considering the benet or prot of a matter was a primary consideration both in </p>
<p>rhetoric and ethics (e.g., Musonius Rufus 8, p. 60.10–12; Arius Didymus Epit. 2.7.5d, pp. </p>
<p>28–29.17–29; for a number of sources, see Keener 2003b: 856).</p>
