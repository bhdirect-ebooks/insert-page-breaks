<p>Romans 16:17–20</p>
<p>190</p>
<p>Paul, whose mission is to bring Gentiles to obey Israel’s God (1:5; </p>
<p>15:18; 16:25), encourages them that their obedience is widely known </p>
<p>(16:19; for the fame of the capital’s church, cf. 1:8; for Paul’s encourage-</p>
<p>ment in the midst of exhortation, cf. 15:14–15). Nevertheless, he wants </p>
<p>them to be “wise” in good matters (contrast 1:22) and “innocent” or un-</p>
<p>skilled in what is evil (16:19).</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>He is not suggesting that they should be</p>
<p>naïve regarding evildoers, a potential interpretation that he has already </p>
<p>expressly disavowed at the end of 16:18. In view of 16:20, it is possible that </p>
<p>Paul has in mind the disastrous consequences of the rst humans partak-</p>
<p>ing from the tree that provided experiential knowledge of the dierence </p>
<p>between good and evil (cf. Rom 5:12–21; Gen 3:5).</p>
<p>When Paul speaks of God crushing Satan under their feet (16:20), he </p>
<p>probably thinks of Gen 3:15 in light of a line of Jewish tradition that iden-</p>
<p>tied Satan or the devil with the serpent in that passage (cf. Rev 12:9).</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Because they belong to the new Adam (5:12–21), perhaps understood as </p>
<p>the woman’s promised seed of Gen 3:15, their victory is certain, even if </p>
<p>not yet consummated.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Greetings from Corinth (16:21–23)</p>
Having sent greetings to individuals in Rome, Paul now includes greet-
<p>ings from others to the church in Rome, also a common custom in let-</p>
<p>ters.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>Timothy is one of Paul’s chief companions (e.g., 1 Cor 4:17; 16:10;</p>
<p>Phil 2:19–22; 1 ess 3:2), who will soon leave with Paul for Jerusalem </p>
<p>(Acts 20:4). Likewise, Jason</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>and Sosipater (a variant form of Sopater)</p>
<p>are with Paul in Corinth as Macedonian delegates for the collection that </p>
<p>all of them will soon accompany to Jerusalem (Acts 17:5–9; 20:4; cf. Rom </p>
<p>33. is may echo the saying behind Matt 10:16, which was probably in Q (cf. the </p>
<p>abbreviated version in Luke 10:3).</p>
<p>34. Because snakes oen bit feet (Aeschylus Suppl. 896–97; Sophocles Phil. 632; Ovid </p>
<p>Metam. 11.775–76), stepping on one was a dangerous maneuver (Virgil Aen. 2.379–81; </p>
<p>Diodorus Siculus 20.42.2; Sib. Or. 1.59–64).</p>
<p>35. Some nd messianic hints even in the common Greek version of Gen 3:15 (Martin </p>
<p>1965; Collins 1997; Alexander 1997), but this seems unclear. In any case, the Targum so </p>
<p>applied it (McNamara 1972: 121).</p>
<p>36. See e.g., Cicero Att. 5.9; Fronto Ad M. Caes. 3.12; 4.10; especially Weima 1994: </p>
<p>42–45.</p>
<p>37. Many Jews bore this Greek name, as here (see e.g., CPJ 3:179; CIJ 1:25, §32; 2:15, </p>
<p>§749).</p>
