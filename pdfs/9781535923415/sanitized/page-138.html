<p>Romans 8:31–39</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>Paul emphasizes God’s love in 8:35, 39, and Christ’s love in 8:37 </p>
<p>(which in Paul’s thinking is linked with his death for others, Gal 2:20). </p>
<p>Paul has already shown the great price God’s love for humanity cost him </p>
<p>in Christ (5:5, 8). Here the context involves God’s eternal purposes for his </p>
<p>children; nothing can thwart these purposes, which are already as good </p>
<p>as done (8:29–30; cf. 9:11, 15–18). God justies (8:33), so he will glorify </p>
<p>(8:30); nothing can condemn believers (8:33–34). In some other contexts </p>
<p>Paul enjoins perseverance and warns against falling away (e.g., 11:22; 1 </p>
<p>Cor 9:27; 10:5–12; Gal 4:11, 19; 5:4; Col 1:22–23), but the rhetorical func-</p>
<p>tion of the present context is assurance in Christ.</p>
<p>Ancient writers used aiction lists for various purposes. Philosophers </p>
<p>oen used them, as Paul did for his own ministry (e.g., 1 Cor 4:9–13; 2 </p>
<p>Cor 4:8–10; 6:4–10; 11:23–33), to demonstrate the integrity of their char-</p>
<p>acter exhibited in testing.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>e present suerings include deep poverty</p>
<p>and persecution (8:35);</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> for the latter point (which will be a critical mat-</p>
<p>ter for the Roman church within a few years) Paul in 8:36 cites Ps 44:22, </p>
<p>from a psalm of complaint (as in Rom 15:3). Whereas believers are “reck-</p>
<p>oned” righteous in God’s sight (Rom 4:24), here they are “reckoned” as </p>
<p>sheep for slaughter.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>Whereas the experience of such wholesale slaughter</p>
<p>bespeaks utter defeat, Paul in 8:37 declares that believers “prevail com-</p>
<p>pletely” (BDAG ὑπερνικάω), experiencing utter victory.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>is is because</p>
<p>even the harshest circumstances cannot dislodge believers from God’s </p>
<p>love and the incomparably greater hope of glory that awaits them (8:18; </p>
<p>hope made rm through aiction, 5:3–4). ey are special to God; he is </p>
<p>with them and has a purpose for them, working even their suerings for </p>
<p>eternal glory (8:28).</p>
<p>53. See Fitzgerald 1988: 43–70; idem 2000: 16–17.</p>
<p>54. “Nakedness” could mean little-clothed (2 Cor 11:27; Tob 1:17; 4:16; Euripides El. </p>
<p>308; Livy 45.39.17; Epictetus Disc. 3.22.45–47). “Sword” can apply to execution (13:4) or </p>
<p>war, but he probably applies the text in 8:36 to unjust, violent oppression (esp. for faith); </p>
<p>later R. Akiba applied it to Jewish martyrs (Bonsirven 1964: 56; cf. more generally Sipre </p>
<p>Deut. 32.3.4).</p>
<p>55. For sheep destined for slaughter, see e.g., Isa 53:7; Jer 25:34; Zech 11:4, 7.</p>
<p>56. For remaining unconquered in suering, see Seneca Ep. Lucil. 27.3; 67.16; idem </p>
<p>Dial. 7.8.3; Epictetus Disc. 1.1.23; 1.18.21–22; 2.18.31; for martyrs triumphing by mar-</p>
<p>tyrdom for truth, Xenophon Apol. 29 (Socrates); Rev 12:11; 15:2. Many contend that </p>
<p>“overwhelming” conquest here alludes to suerings not simply being vanquished, but </p>
<p>working for good (Rom 8:28).</p>
