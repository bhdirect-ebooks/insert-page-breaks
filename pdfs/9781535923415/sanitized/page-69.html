<p>Made Right by Trusting Christ</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>Paul develops this condemnation of those who piously denounce </p>
<p>sin by means of a syllogism: they commit these sins (2:1), we know that </p>
<p>such sins merit God’s judgment (2:2; cf. 1:32), therefore they will not </p>
<p>escape God’s judgment (2:3). Most people recognized and condemned </p>
<p>such inconsistency,</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> a point to which Paul returns in a more explicit chal-</p>
<p>lenge to a Jewish interlocutor in 2:17–25. Paul prepares his audience far </p>
<p>in advance for his warning against judging culturally dierent believers </p>
<p>in Rom 14:3–4, 10, 13.</p>
<p>If anyone wishes to appeal to God’s mercy, Paul is clear (against some </p>
<p>of his detractors, 3:8) that God’s mercy gives space for repentance. at </p>
<p>is, God’s mercy brings about righteousness, rather than simply blessing </p>
<p>sinners in their sin (2:4). Jewish hearers would understand that the kind-</p>
<p>ness of God was what led people to repentance (2:4);</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>some also thought</p>
<p>of treasuring up rewards in heaven (cf. e.g., Tob 4:9–10)—though what is </p>
<p>stored up here is wrath (2:5)!</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Continuing his lavish display of eective literary devices, Paul now </p>
<p>reinforces his point with inverted repetition, what is called a chiasm </p>
<p>(2:6–11):</p>
<p>A God repays each according to their works (2:6)</p>
<p> B To those who do good, seeking glory and honor</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> (2:7)</p>
<p> C But wrath to those who disobey the truth (2:8)</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> C´ Suering to those who do evil (2:9)</p>
<p> B´ But glory and honor to those who do good (2:10)</p>
<p>A´ Because God is impartial (2:11)</p>
<p>In this passage Paul argues for God’s ethnic impartiality.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Contrary to</p>
<p>Jewish expectations, God will judge both Jew and Gentile (2:9–10), both </p>
<p>3. E.g., Matt 7:1; Polybius 12.23.1, 3; 12.24.5; Seneca Dial. 4.28.6–8; Juvenal Sat. </p>
<p>2.9–10, 20–21; b. Roš. Haš. 16b.</p>
<p>4. Cf. Let. Aris. 187–88; Wis 11:23; 12:10, 19; the h benediction of the ’Amida.</p>
<p>5. e connection is uncertain, since “treasure up” did not always carry its originally </p>
<p>literal sense (see e.g., Prov 1:18; 2:7; 16:27 lxx).</p>
<p>6. Roman culture valued seeking honor and glory, but the glory Paul emphasizes here </p>
<p>is eternal (8:18; 9:23), equivalent to God’s praise at the judgment (2:29). On the honor </p>
<p>sense of “glory” (and seeking only honor from God, as in 2:29), see the information in </p>
<p>Keener 2003b: 885–86; for other aspects of “glory,” see ibid., 410.</p>
<p>7. Cf. those disobeying the truth about God (1:25) facing wrath (1:18).</p>
