<p>Romans 16:1–2</p>

<p>ness; trade ties between Rome and Corinth were strong, and business-</p>
<p>women did travel. Given Paul’s praise of her business skills, some suggest </p>
<p>that he also hoped that she could raise support for his Spanish mission in </p>
<p>Rome.</p>
<p>Greetings to Roman Believers (16:3–16)</p>
<p>Paul sends greetings to believers (probably mostly or wholly leaders) </p>
<p>whom he knows or knows about in Rome, in some cases “recommend-</p>
ing” them as well. Adding greetings to individuals at the end of letters
<p>was common</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>(though usually not so many). Building rapport with one’s</p>
<p>audience was important, but given the risks of inadvertently omitting </p>
<p>anyone, Paul seems especially interested in building rapport here, prob-</p>
<p>ably because he plans to visit and has not been there previously. Western </p>
<p>readers may think of greetings as mere formality, but they held a deeper </p>
<p>social meaning in Paul’s culture. Paul’s personal interest in believers in </p>
<p>Rome (as elsewhere) illustrates concretely the character of love he has </p>
<p>been urging (12:3–5, 10; 13:8–10; 14:1—15:7; cf. 1:11–12; 15:23–24).</p>
<p>e constant travelers between Rome and Corinth (where Paul </p>
<p>writes) and the various Jewish believers from Rome who had recently </p>
<p>resided in Corinth and elsewhere during Claudius’s ban (Acts 18:2) help </p>
<p>explain Paul’s knowledge of so many leaders in the church in Rome. While </p>
<p>we can identify some persons as Jewish, we cannot certainly infer ethnic-</p>
<p>ity from names; many Diaspora Jews used typical Gentile names (even </p>
<p>named for pagan deities, such as Hermes).</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>at Greek names are more</p>
<p>common than Latin ones in Paul’s list suggests that, as we would expect, </p>
<p>the churches have made the greatest inroads among eastern provincials </p>
<p>living in Rome, as well as among slaves.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>12. E.g., P. Oxy. 114.16–18; 1296.9–19; Cicero Att. 6.3, end; Fronto Verum Imp. 2.6, </p>
<p>end; Weima 1994: 39–42.</p>
<p>13. A name in 16:14; for Jews, see CPJ 3:9, §453; 3:175–76; CIJ 1:23, §26; 1:75, §108; </p>
<p>1:255, §324.</p>
<p>14. A Latin name does not guarantee Roman citizenship, but Roman citizens here </p>
<p>would probably be addressed by Roman names. Half of Rome’s Jewish population had </p>
<p>Latin names, whereas only six of the twenty-six persons Paul greets do (and some of these </p>
<p>predominate among slaves and freedpersons, like “Julia”); fourteen have common slave </p>
<p>names. Up to one-third of Paul’s associates have Latin names, vastly higher than average </p>
<p>in the Greek east (Judge 1982: 13), but a high percentage of these are from Corinth.</p>
