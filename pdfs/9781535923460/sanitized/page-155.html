<p>Elders Leading Well (5:17–25) 139</p>
<p>Jesus at the second coming.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>Being impartial is very important to the</p>
<p>heavenly tribunal.</p>
<p>e next verse appears to continue the topic of judicial matters. Do </p>
<p>not lay hands hastily and do not share in another’s sins; keep yourself </p>
<p>pure (5:22). In 4:14, lay hands is used to describe a symbolic act, when </p>
<p>the elders commissioned Timothy, asking God to give or conrm his </p>
<p>spiritual gi, as a blessing for his ministry. at event was done by the </p>
<p>council of elders. But, this laying of hands is done only by Timothy. A </p>
<p>consequence of laying hands quickly would be participating with sin, but </p>
<p>Timothy must continue to guard his own purity.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>In 5:22, the same word</p>
<p>family for sin is used, as in 5:20 (hamartia, hamartanō). us, from the </p>
<p>context, Paul appears to be summarizing his earlier discussion (5:19–21). </p>
<p>Paul does not tell Timothy not to lay hands, but not to do so hastily or </p>
<p>quickly or easily.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>Since laying hands is a symbolic act with a variety of</p>
<p>meanings,</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>being sure of the meaning that best ts this context is not</p>
<p>easy. e most frequent understanding is that lay hands in 5:22 refers to </p>
<p>commissioning or ordaining an elder to oce.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>e process of choosing</p>
<p>and voting for elders (Titus 1:5; Acts 14:23) would be similar to the com-</p>
<p>missioning to a task such as received by Stephen and the other “deacons,” </p>
<p>Paul and Barnabas, or Joshua.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>Although Timothy alone is mentioned,</p>
<p>he might still work with others to do the actual commissioning. e rea-</p>
<p>son to avoid haste would be to test an elder’s character rst (1 Tim 3:6, </p>
<p>10). Elders could be sinning still but their sin not be easily evident (5:24). </p>
<p>By approving someone who later might be shown to be sinning either in </p>
<p>behavior or teaching, Timothy would thus be partnering or sharing in </p>
<p>their sin (5:22). </p>
<p>Paul then adds what looks to be homey advice to Timothy on his </p>
<p>health in the midst of sentences that deal with sin but relates to Paul’s </p>
<p>command to guard his purity (5:22, 24–25): No longer drink water, </p>
<p>but use a little wine on account of the stomach and your frequent </p>
<p>94. Matt 16:27; 25:31; Luke 9:26; 2 ess 1:7. e three holy witnesses (God, Jesus, </p>
<p>angels) balance the three human witnesses.</p>
<p>95. See Titus 2:5; 1 Tim 4:12; 5:2. </p>
<p>96. As in Gal 1:6; 2 ess 2:2; BDAG, 992.</p>
<p>97. See 1 Tim 4:14.</p>
