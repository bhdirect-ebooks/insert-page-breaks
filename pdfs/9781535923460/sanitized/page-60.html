<p>1 Timothy 144</p>
<p>to comport himself as a soldier under leave, but as an active soldier. His </p>
<p>“enlisting ocer” is Paul (1 Tim 1:18). Like a good soldier he should be </p>
<p>attentive to his orders. But, in contrast to a soldier who might have to </p>
<p>serve in a war with which he diers, Timothy serves in a good campaign. </p>
<p>His tools are not javelins or swords or arrows, but, rst, the prophecies </p>
<p>he received, and, second, the twin virtues of faith and a good conscience </p>
<p>(1:19).</p>
<p>Faith is an important theme in Paul’s letters, including the Pastoral </p>
<p>Letters (56 refs. in 13 chs.), but it is especially important in 1 Timothy </p>
<p>(33 refs. in 6 chs.).</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>Faith is a virtue that Christians can have, having</p>
<p>received it from God, the One who is the epitome of faithfulness (1:14). </p>
<p>e object of faith for Christians is Jesus Christ (1:16; 3:16).</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>e faith</p>
<p>may also describe all of Christianity, its message of trust in Jesus, and its </p>
<p>impact on a Christian’s life.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>Faith and a good conscience are mentioned</p>
<p>together three times in 1 Timothy. ey are (along with a “pure heart”) </p>
<p>a basis for love (1:5) and they accompany perseverance in the Christian </p>
<p>walk (1:18–19). If they do not accompany (as virtues) the Christian walk </p>
<p>(1:19a), they aect the ability to persevere in the Christian walk (1:19b). </p>
<p>In 3:9, a clean conscience is the receptacle or environment in which faith </p>
<p>(as a synecdoche for all of Christianity) must reside. </p>
<p>Consciences should be both good and “clean.” Initially, only Christ </p>
<p>can cleanse the conscience perfectly and permanently from sin and evil </p>
<p>so that humans can draw near to God in condence.</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>e faith and</p>
<p>the cleansed conscience that Christ gives then become weapons to arm </p>
<p>Christians in their daily walks. But, especially at Ephesus, the interior </p>
<p>faculty for the personal discernment of good and evil, that interior con-</p>
<p>versation that might be shared with another, needs to be maintained, </p>
<p>along with trust (or faith) in Jesus and in his promises and precepts for </p>
<p>living.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>e danger at Ephesus is the searing of the conscience (1 Tim</p>
<p>4:2), while the danger at Corinth is a weak conscience becoming soiled </p>
<p>or wounded (1 Cor 8:7, 12).</p>
<p>By rejecting conscience, Hymenaeus and Alexander (1:19b–20) </p>
<p>have replaced “the internalizing of the norm of godliness, for an external </p>
<p>145. Paul uses this word family (pistis; pisteuō; pistos) more frequently only in Rom </p>
<p>(61 refs. in 16 chs.) and Gal (27 refs. in 6 chs.) (Kohlenberger 1995: 802–5).</p>
<p>146. For “faith” as a virtue, see 1 Tim 1:5, 19; 2:7, 15; 4:12; 5:12; 6:11.</p>
<p>147. 1 Tim 1:2, 4; 4:1, 6; 5:8; 6:10, 12, 21.</p>
<p>148. Heb 9:9–10, 14; 10:2, 19, 22.</p>
<p>149. See 1 Tim 1:5.</p>
