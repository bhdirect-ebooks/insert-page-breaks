<p>1 Timothy 134</p>
<p>personal gospel, “good tidings”</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> is that Christ Jesus “appointed into min-</p>
<p>istry” Paul himself, a former “blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent </p>
<p>person” who received mercy because Christ Jesus’ grace “overowed with </p>
<p>faith and love” (1:12–14). Or, in a general sense, the good news is that </p>
<p>“Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners” (1:15). Indeed, God is a </p>
<p>Savior “who wants all humans to be saved and to come into a knowledge </p>
<p>of truth” (2:4; 4:10). Christ Jesus himself is “a ransom in behalf of all” </p>
<p>(2:6). Jesus’ own call was to bring “good news” to the needy.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is news is glorious (1:11) for the needy who need forgiveness, </p>
<p>empowerment, and armation (such as Paul). God deserves glory and </p>
<p>honor for the salvation that God brings.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>As early as Moses’ song, aer</p>
<p>God saved the Israelites from the pursuing Egyptians, God’s glory be-</p>
<p>came recognized: “Let us sing to the Lord, for he is gloriously gloried </p>
<p>... I will glorify him” (Exod 15:1, 2 LXX).</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>From God emanates a glory</p>
<p>that surrounds God’s good news. is good news has been entrusted to </p>
<p>Paul</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>to then entrust to others, such as Timothy and Titus (Titus 1:3),</p>
<p>who are to guard it (1 Tim 6:20), and, as well, entrust it to other believers </p>
<p>(2 Tim 2:2).</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul, Once Unrighteous, </p>
<p>ReceivedMercy(1:12–17)</p>
<p>To understand the good news, Timothy is reminded of Paul’s former life </p>
<p>of “bad news.” As Paul explains, the law should be applied to the unrigh-</p>
<p>teous (1:8–11), exemplied at one time by Paul himself, but he received </p>
<p>mercy as an example to others. As Adam is a prototype of those who </p>
<p>sin in knowledge, while Eve is a prototype of those who sin because of </p>
<p>deceit (2:14), Paul is a prototype of those who sin out of ignorance but </p>
<p>are then forgiven (1:12–17):</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>I have gratitude to the one strengthening</p>
<p>results in continuous healthy maturing growth instead of unorthodox destructive “dis-</p>
<p>ease” and continued infancy. </p>
