<p>1 Timothy 2–378</p>
<p>Godly Overseeing (3:1–16)</p>
<p>Paul has been urging godly peaceful lives so that all people may be saved </p>
<p>and come to knowledge of the truth. is is accomplished by prayer for </p>
<p>all (2:1–7), living a peaceable life of prayer (2:8–10), learning peaceably </p>
<p>(2:11–15), and having godly overseeing (3:1–16). Before discussing any </p>
<p>virtues, Paul presents the importance of desire: e word is trustworthy: </p>
<p>If anyone aspires to overseeing, (s)he desires a good work (3:1). is </p>
<p>is Paul’s second authoritative, accurate teaching from God expressed in </p>
<p>a pithy saying or summary statement that can be passed on to others as </p>
<p>fully reliable.</p>
<p>193</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul addresses women and men since anyone (3:1, tis) is generic,</p>
<p>194</p>
<p> </p>
<p>using two synonyms: oregō (aspires to) and epithymeō (desires). Oregō </p>
<p>has the literal sense of “stretch out” and, metaphorically, “reach aer, </p>
<p>grasp at, yearn for” or “aspire to.”</p>
<p>195</p>
<p>us, Christian men and women are</p>
<p>to “stretch” themselves in order “to grasp” the oce of overseeing. Oregō </p>
<p>can be a negative desire (as to love money which results in drawing one </p>
<p>away from the faith and giving one pain, as in 1 Tim 6:10) or a positive </p>
<p>desire (to live as a “pilgrim” on earth, living to prepare for a heavenly </p>
<p>citizenship as in Heb 11:16). Epithymeō, a strong passion turned toward </p>
<p>something, although largely negative, can also have positive connota-</p>
<p>tions.</p>
<p>196</p>
<p>us, desires need to be evaluated. But, in 1 Timothy 3:1, the</p>
<p>aspiration is good because the goal is good.</p>
<p>e object is overseeing (episkopē, 3:1). Episkopē is a feminine </p>
<p>abstract noun,</p>
<p>197</p>
<p>in contrast to episkopos (overseer), which species a</p>
<p>concrete person, in verse 2. Overseeing or the “oce of episkopos”</p>
<p>198</p>
<p>can</p>
<p>refer to the functions of an apostle (Acts 1:20) or to leadership in general </p>
<p>(Ps 108:8 LXX). Oen it refers to an act of judgment, an “inspection, </p>
<p>193. See 1 Tim 1:15; Titus 3:8.</p>
<p>194. See NRSV, NIV, ESV, NEB, JB, NLT vs. KJV, NASB, Did. 15:1.</p>
<p>195. LSJ, 1246–47; BDAG, 721. Its related noun orguia literally refers to stretching </p>
<p>out one’s arms (ayer, 452; Acts 27:28).</p>
<p>196. See Titus 2:12.</p>
<p>197. e Greek feminine episkopē appears to function like the Hebrew abstract </p>
<p>feminine (GKC: 393).</p>
<p>198. LSJ, 657.</p>
