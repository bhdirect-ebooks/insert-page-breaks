<p>True Widows and Younger Widows (5:3–16) 123</p>
<p>mandment to honor one’s parents to include taking care of them physi-</p>
<p>cally (Matt 15:3–6; Mark 7:9–13). Paul seems to follow this mandate: But </p>
<p>if some widow has children or grandchildren, let them keep on learn-</p>
<p>ing to show piety rst to their own household and to keep on giving </p>
<p>back to the parents; for this is pleasing before God (5:4).</p>
<p>Taking care of one’s parents is an aspect of “godliness” (to show </p>
<p>piety, eusebeō), a way to live, dedicating oneself to please God in one’s </p>
<p>words and actions.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Here the object of such worship of God is shown in</p>
<p>one’s own household. How can one say one loves God, whom one has not </p>
<p>seen, when one cannot love one’s own family members, whom one can </p>
<p>see (1 John 4:20)? </p>
<p>While Jesus and Paul insist that children or grandchildren (5:4) </p>
<p>should take care of fathers and mothers or grandmothers as a way to </p>
<p>thank them for having taken care of them, the Jewish rabbinic laws placed </p>
<p>the responsibility on the heirs of the former husband, unless they reim-</p>
<p>bursed the widow her dowry. e heirs of the deceased husband legally </p>
<p>were required to maintain the widow in the house they had inherited </p>
<p>(m. Ketub. 4:12; 12:3–4). Jesus broadened all these teachings by having </p>
<p>his disciple John “adopt” Jesus’ mother Mary as his own mother (John </p>
<p>19:26–27). In this manner, Jesus created a new family of believers who </p>
<p>would love one another, by being responsible for one another. </p>
<p>A real widow had no family to provide for her: But the real widow </p>
<p>who is also le alone has hoped on God and continues in prayers for </p>
<p>needs and reverent prayers by night and by day, but the one living </p>
<p>luxuriously has died (5:5–6). e verb form (chēreuō) of widow (chēra) </p>
<p>means “to be without.”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>In a patriarchal society, where a widow did not</p>
<p>inherit her husband’s property, she would be without sucient nancial </p>
<p>resources.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Even those widows who had property were oen robbed, even</p>
<p>by religious leaders. Jesus denounced those scribes who, while seeking </p>
<p>places of honor in synagogues and banquets, “devour widows’ houses” </p>
<p>(Luke 20:46–47). An early document recounts how Syrion of raso, </p>
<p>the owner of a ock of sheep which the husband of Aurelia Artemis </p>
<p>had tended, at the very funeral, burst into her house to seize the chil-</p>
<p>dren’s property and the sixty sheep and goats belonging to the deceased </p>
<p>6. See 1 Tim 4:7; 2:2; Titus 1:1.</p>
<p>7. LSJ, 1990.</p>
<p>8. One estimate is widows comprised 30% of women in the ancient world (Win-</p>
<p>ter 2003: 124). In the third century in Rome, the church supported over 1500 widows </p>
<p>and persons in distress (Eusebius, Hist. eccl. 6. 43 [11]).</p>
