<p>1 Timothy 6:3–21160</p>
<p>the resurrection, will have new bodies that do not die because God is a </p>
<p>God over whom death is not master. Jesus did die, but he was resurrected.</p>
<p>Light (phōs, 6:16) is a signicant aspect of Paul’s life. His life was </p>
<p>turned around when suddenly, as he journeyed to Damascus, to persecute </p>
<p>Christian men and women, “a light from heaven ashed around him,” </p>
<p>blinding him.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> Only by God through Ananias could Saul be healed.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is light was “brighter than the sun” (Acts 26:13). Paul’s ministry then </p>
<p>came to be to “enlighten” others.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>Humans can not directly look into</p>
<p>the sun without eventually becoming blind. Paul thus describes God the </p>
<p>Trinity as dwelling in unapproachable light. Like a shining fortress en-</p>
<p>compassed by deep, dark valleys</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>is God. Light is a frequent metaphor</p>
<p>for righteousness.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p> God created light.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>Metaphorically, God is light.</p>
<p>Jesus “was the true light, the one giving light to all people.”</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>In the New</p>
<p>Jerusalem, no “great lights” (sun or moon) will be needed because the </p>
<p>Lamb will be the lamp.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>God is so awesome that what blinds humans is</p>
<p>to God merely a robe that serves as a garment to cover oneself (Ps 103:2 </p>
<p>LXX).</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>No one is able to see God and live (Exod 33:20) but, yet, by God</p>
<p>becoming esh, humans could then see God.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>Paul closes this doxology,</p>
<p>as he did the other one (1:17), blessing God with honor</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>and also power</p>
<p>or strength (6:16).</p>
<p>105. Acts 9:3, 8–9; 22:6, 11.</p>
<p>106. Acts 9:15, 17–18; 22:13.</p>
<p>107. Acts 13:47; 26:18. </p>
<p>108. Josephus, J. W. 7.8.2 [280].</p>
<p>109. E.g., 1 John 1:5–7; Prov 4:18.</p>
<p>110. Gen 1:3–5; Jas 1:17. Light can refer to lamps, candlesticks, and re (Exod </p>
<p>27:20; 35:16; Lev 24:2; 2 Chron 4:20; Isa 50:11; Jer 25:10; Mark 14:54), or to the sun, </p>
<p>moon, and stars, the “great lights” (Ps 135:7–9 LXX; Isa 13:10; Jer 4:23; 38:35).</p>
<p>111. John 1:9; 3:19; 8:12; 9:5; 12:35–36, 46; 1 John 1:5. At the transguration, Jesus </p>
<p>became as “white as the light” (Matt 17:2).</p>
<p>112. Rev 21:23; 22:5.</p>
<p>113. See also Exod 24:17, where the glory of the Lord was like burning re and </p>
<p>Acts 2:3, where the Holy Spirit appeared “as re.”</p>
<p>114. 1 Tim 3:16; John 1:14; 1 John 1:1.</p>
<p>115. See 1 Tim 5:3, 17; Rev 5:13.</p>
