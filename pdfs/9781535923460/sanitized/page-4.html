<p>NCCS | New Covenant Commentary Series</p>
<p>e New Covenant Commentary Series (NCCS) is designed for ministers and </p>
<p>students who require a commentary that interacts with the text and context of </p>
<p>each New Testament book and pays specic attention to the impact of the text </p>
<p>upon the faith and praxis of contemporary faith communities.</p>
<p>e NCCS has a number of distinguishing features. First, the contribu-</p>
tors come from a diverse array of backgrounds in regards to their Christian
<p>denominations and countries of origin. Unlike many commentary series that </p>
<p>tout themselves as international the NCCS can truly boast of a genuinely inter-</p>
<p>national cast of contributors with authors drawn from every continent of the </p>
<p>world (except Antarctica) including countries such as the United States, Puerto </p>
<p>Rico, Australia, the United Kingdom, Kenya, India, Singapore, and Korea. We </p>
<p>intend the NCCS to engage in the task of biblical interpretation and theological </p>
<p>reection from the perspective of the global church. Second, the volumes in this </p>
<p>series are not verse-by-verse commentaries, but they focus on larger units of </p>
<p>text in order to explicate and interpret the story in the text as opposed to some </p>
<p>oen atomistic approaches. ird, a further aim of these volumes is to provide </p>
<p>an occasion for authors to reect on how the New Testament impacts the life, </p>
<p>faith, ministry, and witness of the New Covenant Community today. is occurs </p>
<p>periodically under the heading of “Fusing the Horizons and Forming the Com-</p>
<p>munity.” Here authors provide windows into community formation (how the </p>
<p>text shapes the mission and character of the believing community) and ministe-</p>
<p>rial formation (how the text shapes the ministry of Christian leaders).</p>
<p>It is our hope that these volumes will represent serious engagements </p>
<p>with the New Testament writings, done in the context of faith, in service of the </p>
<p>church, and for the glorication of God.</p>
