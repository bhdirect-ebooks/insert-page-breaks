<p>Timothy Should Fight His Own Fight of the Faith</p>
<p>Paul then moves to the nal section of his letter, explaining that het-</p>
<p>erodox teaching should be ed because it robs the truth (6:3–10), but </p>
<p>Timothy instead should seek righteousness, ghting the good ght of the </p>
<p>faith, guarding the commandment, not open to attack until Jesus returns </p>
<p>(6:11–16), encouraging the rich to rely on God, not riches (6:17–19), and </p>
<p>Paul summarizes that Timothy should guard the deposit, turning away </p>
<p>from false knowledge (6:20–21a). </p>

<p>and word-battles, from which comes envy, contention, slander, evil </p>
<p>suspicions, constant irritations among humans corrupted in mind </p>
<p>and robbed of the truth, thinking godliness to be a means of gain </p>
<p>(6:3–5). Paul continues the topic of teaching (6:2b) and recalls the initial </p>
<p>topic of heterodoxy.</p>
