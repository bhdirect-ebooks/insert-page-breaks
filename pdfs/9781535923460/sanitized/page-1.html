<p>“As a believer with the simple faith of a child, the author manages to </p>
<p>provide a well-researched and easily readable scholarly contribution on </p>
<p>1 Timothy. It is refreshing to read this well-balanced contribution by a </p>
<p>female scholar on this letter that repeatedly refers to the role of woman </p>
<p>in the church but also to other ministerial strategies. Her perspectives </p>
<p>on the inuence of this text on a contemporary faith community are </p>
<p>enlightening.”</p>
<p>—Francois P. Viljoen, Professor, Faculty of eology, North-West University</p>
<p>“Spencer’s commentary on 1 Timothy provides an articulate defense of </p>
<p>Pauline authorship that interacts well with critical scholarship. It is full </p>
<p>of valuable grammatical, lexical, syntactical, historical, and theological </p>
<p>insights. . . . eological insights include its discussion of the heretical </p>
<p>teaching addressed in 1 Timothy and its outstanding treatment of </p>
<p>1 Timothy 2:15. I enthusiastically endorse this well-documented </p>
<p>commentary.”</p>
<p>—Philip B. Payne, Author of Man and Woman, One in Christ</p>
