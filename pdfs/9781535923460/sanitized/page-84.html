<p>but the woman, having been deceived, came to a state of transgres-</p>
<p>sion (2:13–14). Paul’s illustration is an “analogy” (“a form of reasoning </p>
<p>in which one thing is inferred to be similar to another thing in a certain </p>
<p>respect, on the basis of the known similarity between the things in other </p>
<p>respects”).</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>Adam and Eve both were humans formed by God, but they</p>
<p>sinned. Eve, being deceived, aected herself and others. Paul’s technique </p>
<p>is not unlike the rabbis who used analogies to make the Old Testament </p>
<p>relevant to present and on-going circumstances.</p>
<p>143</p>
<p>Paul begins with the basics: Adam rst was formed, then Eve </p>
<p>(2:13). Plassō signies “form, mould, prop. of the artist who works in </p>
<p>so substances, such as earth, clay, wax” and, metaphorically, “mould, </p>
<p>form by education, training, etc.”</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>is same verb is used in Genesis 2:7:</p>
<p>“God formed the human, dust (soil “heaped up”</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>) from the ground.”</p>
<p>146</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But, plassō can also have a metaphorical sense in the Bible, for example, </p>
<p>the Lord forms the Messiah “with understanding” (Isa 53:11). Moses </p>
<p>employs a similar wordplay</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>: God, the “father” purchased and made </p>
<p>and formed Israel (Deut 32:6). God had not formed Israel literally, but </p>
<p>“formed” Israel conceptually as a nation liberated from Egypt and, then, </p>
<p>taught Israel what it meant to be a holy, separated nation.</p>

<p> Habak-</p>
<p>use rst” (the instruction in v. 12 is illustrated by Adam and Eve) (Robertson 1934: </p>
<p>1190). Cf. Mounce 2000: 131. In reality, explanatory, causal, and illative are very close. </p>
<p>at is why the context is crucial to determine “the precise relation between clauses </p>
<p>or sentences” joined by gar (Robertson 1934: 1191). Gar in 4:10 seems to be also ex-</p>
<p>planatory or an “appendix to the train of thought” (Robertson 1934: 1190) citing the </p>
<p>saying introduced in v. 9. Gar in 5:15 gives an example of how the adversary has been </p>
<p>victorious. In 5:11 gar could introduce an explanation of what happens when younger </p>
<p>widows are on the list—their sensual desires alienate them from Christ or a cause </p>
<p>(why not place the younger widows on the list? Answer: Because their sensual desires </p>
<p>alienate them). Verse 6:7 could be explanatory (an example that elaborates on v. 6) or </p>
<p>causal (why contentment is enough). See Payne 2009: 399–402. </p>
<p>142. Webster’s 2001: 74. Lanham (1991: 10) denes “analogy” as “reasoning or </p>
<p>arguing from parallel cases.” In Greek, it is “proportion” (LSJ, 111). Keener and others </p>
<p>have independently noticed this analogy (1992: 117 n. 118). </p>
<p>143. See Spencer 1985: 89–90 for examples how rabbis even used “prefall” illustra-</p>
<p>tions in this way.</p>
<p>144. LSJ, 1412. See also Belleville 2009: 55.</p>
<p>145. LSJ, 2000.</p>
<p>146. Paul also used the verb in Rom 9:20–21 alluding to Isa 29:16; 45:9.</p>
<p>147. In Greek “paronomasia,” a play (pun) on sense (or sounds) of words. A word </p>
<p>may be used rst in its proper sense, then its derived sense (Lanham 1991: 3, 110; LSJ, </p>
<p>1342). See also 1 Tim 2:9.</p>
<p>148. Deut 31:24–29; 32:4. See also Isa 43:1, 7; 44:21; 49:8.</p>
