<p>A Good Minister (4:6–10) 109</p>
<p>In contrast, he is to keep declining or refusing godless and old-</p>
<p>women’s myths (4:7). e very teaching Timothy is to exhort others to </p>
<p>give up (1:3–4), he is warned himself to guard against (4:7).</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> ese leg-</p>
<p>ends are godless or “profane” (bebēlos), unholy acts that lead to lack of </p>
<p>piety.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> e emphasis is on the unholy character of the legends.</p>
<p>ese myths are also described as those of old women (4:7). Graōdēs </p>
<p>has been translated as “characteristic of an elderly woman of speculative </p>
<p>or legendary accounts that lack Christian pedagogical value,”</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>coming</p>
<p>from graus (“an old woman”) and eidos (“the external form”).</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>Strabo</p>
<p>uses graōdēs for creative old women who proclaim ctional legends </p>
<p>(muthologia) for entertainment not for education (Geogr. I. 2.3. C16). </p>
<p>Plato in his Republic mentions how philosophers, just to be polite, will </p>
<p>agree with “old women” (graus) telling myths.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>us, graōdēs appears</p>
<p>to be an allusion to the fascination with telling myths at Ephesus (1:4) </p>
<p>of which women were an active part (2:12–14; 5:13). In contrast, Paul </p>
<p>encourages the female elders at Crete to teach (Titus 2:3), but not the en-</p>
<p>tertaining tales that are neither instructive nor edifying (4:7). Paul’s point </p>
<p>is not that one must avoid the tales of elderly women, but that one must </p>
<p>avoid speculative tales that may entertain but are not true, instructive, or </p>
<p>edifying. Timothy will not mature spiritually if he relies on accounts that </p>
<p>are unholy and false. But he did well to have learned true teaching from </p>
<p>his grandmother Lois (2 Tim 1:5; 3:14).</p>
<p>Paul began and ends this extended sentence with positive exhorta-</p>
<p>tions: Train for godliness (4:7). He introduces a comparison between </p>
<p>physical and spiritual activities through the common theme of exercise. </p>
<p>e Greeks were known for their emphasis on physical exercise. Gardiner </p>
<p>explains: “Athletics were to the Greek far more than mere recreation. To </p>
<p>the Homeric warrior they were the means of training and maintaining </p>
<p>the physical vigour and activity which he needed in a warlike age .. . </p>
<p>the citizen might at a moment’s notice be called upon to take the eld </p>
<p>and ght.”</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>Emperor Augustus revived athletics even aer the Greek</p>
<p>43. See 1 Tim 1:4; Titus 1:14; 3:9.</p>
