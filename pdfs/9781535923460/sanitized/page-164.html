<p>Excursus: Heresy in 1 Timothy148</p>
<p>For a Christian to be free from legalism, a healthy, working conscience </p>
<p>and healthy teaching are needed.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>If Christ fully saves someone, then</p>
<p>legalistic use of laws is not needed for salvation. Instead of judgment, faith, </p>
<p>love, truth, mercy, purity, and mutual respect should be emphasized.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>All</p>
<p>should be prayed for (2:1; 5:5). Paul is promoting the way of afﬁrmation, </p>
<p>but not of excess: marriage to one person, childrearing, household manage-</p>
<p>ment, food, leadership preparation are afﬁrmed.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>Christ was manifested</p>
<p>in the ﬂesh (2:5; 3:16). Teaching and learning are emphasized for all but </p>
<p>especially those who are ignorant.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> Progress, not perfection, is the stan-</p>
<p>dard (4:15). </p>
<p>Paul redenes means of gain (6:5): But godliness with content-</p>
<p>ment is a great means of gain; for we brought nothing into the world, </p>
<p>for neither are we able to take out anything; but with these we will be </p>
<p>satised—having food and clothing (6:6–8). Godliness is a way to live, </p>
<p>dedicating oneself to please God in one’s words and actions.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> Content-</p>
<p>ment (autarkeia) was a virtue of Stoics and Cynics, “self-suciency” or </p>
<p>“independence,” “the state of one who supports himself without aid fr. </p>
<p>others.”</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>Paul redenes “self-suciency” to the Corinthians as a means</p>
<p>to support, not just oneself, but primarily others (2 Cor 9:8). Although </p>
<p>Paul is thankful to the Philippians for their gis for his ministry, he still </p>
<p>explains that he can remain “strong” or content whether he is in need </p>
<p>or plenty (Phil 4:10–11). us, Paul uses autarkeia to focus on being </p>
<p>satised with what one has. Godliness is a wholesome way to live when </p>
<p>combined with an attitude of contentment.</p>
<p>Paul gives several explanations of why this is true. First, he alludes </p>
<p>to Job (“I myself came forth naked from my mother’s womb, and naked </p>
<p>shall I return there” [1:21]) or Ecclesiastes (“As he came forth naked from </p>
<p>25. 1:5, 19; 3:9.</p>
<p>26. 1:5, 13–14, 16, 19; 2:15; 3:15; 4:12; 5:1–3, 17; 6:11–12, 14.</p>
<p>27. 3:1–2, 4, 12, 15; 4:3–4; 5:9–10, 14.</p>
<p>28. 1:7; 2:11–12; 3:2; 4:13, 16; 5:17.</p>
<p>29. See Titus 1:1; 1 Tim 4:7.</p>
<p>30. BDAG, 152. Autarkeia is composed of autos (“self ”) plus arkeō<span class="_ _3" />(“to be strong”)</p>
<p>(ayer, 73, 85). For instance, Epictetus, the Stoic philosopher, encourages his students </p>
<p>“to be self-sucient (arkeō), to be able to commune with oneself; even as Zeus com-</p>
<p>munes with himself, and is at peace with himself ... so ought we also to be able to </p>
<p>converse with ourselves, not to be in need of others” (Ench. 3.13.7).</p>
