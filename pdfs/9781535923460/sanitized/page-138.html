<p>1 TIMOTHY 5:3—6:2</p>
<p>Church Leaders Should Be Honored </p>
<p>and Justly Treated</p>
<p>Concluding on how to treat young women, Paul now returns again to the </p>
<p>theme of church leaders but more specically women ministering in the </p>
<p>church.</p>
<p>True Widows and Younger Widows (5:3–16)</p>
<p>Widows were potentially needy and potentially ministers in the church: </p>
<p>Keep on honoring widows, the ones truly widows (5:3). With these </p>
<p>words, Paul begins an extended discussion on widows (5:3–16=9 sen-</p>
<p>tences), going back and forth between his explanations about those who </p>
<p>are and are not “in reality” or truly widows so that the church may not </p>
<p>be open to attack. Earlier Paul had implied that elders are to be respected </p>
<p>and not chastised (5:1). Now he goes on to describe a more specic type </p>
<p>of honor for elders—honoring them by showing their value in money.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Timaō is used in the Old and New Testaments for God’s command to </p>
<p>“honor your father and your mother.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Honor may refer to words of</p>
<p>respect,</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> but it may also refer to actions</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>and these actions may also</p>
<p>include physical provisions.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Since some widows were using the honor</p>
<p>given them to live luxuriously, while their families were not providing </p>
<p>for them (5:4, 6), honor in this passage includes providing for physical </p>
<p>needs. e “real” widows were not simply being taken care of, they were </p>
<p>also doing a job: praying (5:5), similar to the elders who were laboring </p>
<p>in “teaching the word” (5:17). Jesus interpreted the Old Testament com-</p>
<p>1. Timaō (verb) means “to x the value” and timē (noun) “a valuing by which the </p>
<p>price is xed” from tiō “to estimate, honor” (ayer, 624).</p>
<p>2. E.g., Exod 20:12; Deut 5:16; Matt 15:4; 19:19; Mark 7:10; 10:19; Luke 18:20.</p>
<p>3. Matt 15:8; Mark 7:6; John 5:23; 1 Tim 1:17; 6:1; 1 Pet 2:17.</p>
<p>4. John 8:49; 12:26.</p>
<p>5. Matt 27:6, 9; Acts 4:34; 5:2–3; 7:16; 28:10.</p>
