<p>1 Timothy 2–374</p>
<p>use of the singular article to refer to e Childbirth,</p>
<p>173</p>
<p> the great Child-</p>
<p>birth by Mary which produced the Savior Jesus. Ignatius, who lived in the </p>
<p>rst century, used a similar synonym for childbirth (ho toketos) to refer </p>
<p>to Jesus: “the virginity of Mary and her childbirth were hidden from the </p>
<p>ruler of this age, as was also the death of the Lord” (Eph. 19:1).</p>
<p>174</p>
<p>us, the</p>
<p>source or ultimate agent, by the use of the passive voice, would be implied </p>
<p>to be Christ Jesus (2:5), the intermediate agent would be the childbirth </p>
<p>by Mary, and the ultimate end would be salvation. Even though Eve came </p>
<p>into a state of transgression (2:14), through another woman, Mary, salva-</p>
<p>tion came. Even Eve was saved as a type of the women at Ephesus. Paul </p>
<p>probably alludes to Genesis 3:15, the protevangelium, the woman’s seed </p>
<p>who bruises the serpent’s head.</p>
<p>175</p>
<p>Jesus as the Messiah is the child who</p>
<p>fullled that nal victory over Satan. Paul uses a similar hermeneutic, an </p>
<p>allusion, in Galatians 3:16 declaring the singular of “ospring” (sperma) </p>
<p>in Genesis 12:7; 13:15; 24:7 is a reference to Christ. Teknogonia (“child-</p>
<p>birth”) may also be an allusion to Genesis 3:16: Eve “shall bring forth </p>
<p>children.” </p>
<p>In Genesis, the Lord suggests that through the means of childbirth </p>
<p>redemption will occur (Gen 3:15). us, one reason the Old and New </p>
<p>Testaments trace genealogies is to trace the potential or prospective birth </p>
<p>of the Redeemer. For instance, Lamech named his son “Noah” with the </p>
<p>hope he would bring relief from Adam’s curse (Gen 5:29; 3:17–19). Sime-</p>
<p>on and Anna perceived the child Jesus was the predicted Messiah (Luke </p>
<p>2:25–38). In the immediate context of 1 Timothy 2, Christ is mentioned </p>
<p>as the mediator between God and humans (2:5–6), and Christ being re-</p>
<p>vealed in the esh is a central Christian proclamation (3:16). e heresy </p>
<p>at Ephesus included teachings that forbade marriage and promoted absti-</p>
<p>nence from foods and a desire to be ascetic that, instead of promoting ho-</p>
<p>liness, resulted in sensuality and self-indulgence.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p>As in Neo-Platonism,</p>
<p>matter was viewed as evil and childbirth too might be perceived as evil. </p>
<p>173. e Greek article retains some of the demonstrative force, serving as a pointer </p>
<p>(Robertson 1934: 754–58). See also Payne 2009: 429–31. Childbirth brings out the </p>
<p>punctiliar sense, the event of a childbirth with a resulting child (Payne 2009: 432–33).</p>
<p>174. See also Gal 4:4 for the use of “woman” to refer to one unnamed woman-</p>
<p>Mary. Apocr. Gen. uses “this childbearing” to refer to Noah (2:15). e angel describes </p>
<p>the baby Jesus as “the one to be born” (to gennōmenon [Luke 1:35]). See Payne 2009: </p>
<p>439 for more early church examples.</p>
