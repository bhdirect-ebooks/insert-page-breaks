<p>e Apostle Paul, Once Unrighteous, ReceivedMercy(1:12–17) 37</p>
<p>not humans rather have faith or trust in Jesus? Pistis can refer either to </p>
<p>the One “in whom condence can be placed” who is the epitome of faith-</p>
<p>fulness–God—or to the one who trusts the One who is trustworthy. Faith </p>
<p>or “faithfulness” is a virtue that Christians can have, having received it </p>
<p>from God.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>When grace overows from the Lord, streaming out with</p>
<p>the grace ow faith and love, the type of faithfulness and love that are </p>
<p>distinctive to Christ Jesus (1:14).</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>is is what Paul received instead of</p>
<p>the punishment he deserved.</p>
<p>Paul’s point is summarized in the saying and doxology that follow: </p>
<p>e word is trustworthy and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus </p>
<p>came into the world to save sinners, of which I myself am rst (1:15). </p>
<p>e phrase the word is trustworthy (pistos ho logos) occurs ve times in </p>
<p>the Pastoral Letters, but each time ts well in the context. Pistos ho logos is </p>
<p>an authoritative, accurate teaching from God expressed in a pithy saying </p>
<p>or summary statement that can be passed on to others as fully reliable.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>112. BDAG, 818, 820.</p>
<p>113. Faithfulness (emeth) and love (hesed) are two central characteristics of God, </p>
<p>e.g., Ps 117:2; Gen 24:27, 49: 32:10; Exod 34:6.</p>
<p>114. See Titus 3:8.</p>
