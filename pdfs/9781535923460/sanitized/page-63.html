<p>humans and humans communicating to God.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> Proseuchē is a prayer ad-</p>
<p>dressed to God.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> Being limited to God (or the gods), it emphasizes the sa-</p>
<p>cred nature of the act (reverent), as in Jesus’ lesson to pray: “Our Father, </p>
<p>the One in the heavens, hallowed be your name” (Matt 6:9). ese two </p>
<p>prayers (dēesis, proseuchē) summarize the types of prayers of the widow, </p>
<p>whose hope is only in God (1 Tim 5:5). Her prayers include her need and </p>
<p>her reverence toward God. In summary, dēesis “gives prominence to the </p>
<p>expression of personal need, proseuchē to the element of devotion.”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e third aspect of prayer is enteuxis (intercession). Outside the </p>
<p>New Testament, enteuxis and entugchanō refer to “lighting upon, meeting </p>
<p>with” someone and, thereby, obtaining an audience and conversing with </p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>In the New Testament, it includes the idea of an audience with</p>
<p>someone, but even more purposeful, as in petitioning against someone </p>
<p>(as in a complaint)</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>or petitioning for someone, as in an intercession.</p>
<p>e Holy Spirit and Jesus intercede or advocate for believers.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Believers</p>
<p>can follow their example and intercede to God for other people or other </p>
<p>needs (1 Tim 2:1; 4:5).</p>
<p>anksgiving (eucharistia, eucharisteō) is an important word fam-</p>
<p>ily for Paul. Out of a total 53 New Testament references, 35 are used in </p>
<p>Paul’s letters (66%).</p>
<p>e word family (eucharistia) is a reminder that Jesus, when on </p>
<p>earth, gave thanks for food before distributing and eating it, including at </p>
<p>the “Eucharist.”</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Jesus appreciated the Samaritan who thanked him aer</p>
<p>being healed (Luke 17:12–19).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>is attitude of appreciation was one</p>
<p>Paul wanted to encourage in other Christians, which he himself modeled </p>
<p>(1 Tim 1:12–14). e Lord’s Prayer follows the sequence of adoration fol-</p>
<p>lowed by petition for need (Matt 6:9–13). In 1 Timothy 2:1, the suppliant </p>
<p>begins with need, then moves to a more reverent attitude, then continues </p>
<p>with a focus on others, and concludes with a positive attitude.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>For when</p>
<p>5. E.g., a man covered with leprosy, “falling upon his face, begged” Jesus to make </p>
<p>him clean (Luke 5:12). See also 8: 28, 38; 9:38.</p>
<p> </p>
