<p>Godly Peaceful Lives (2:1–15) 57</p>
<p>and wisdom would contrast with some of the pagan religious festivals for </p>
<p>women.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>e women were not to adorn themselves with gold-braided hair </p>
<p>or pearls or expensive apparel (2:9b). Not in braided hair and gold is </p>
<p>more clearly translated as a hendiadys:</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>gold-braided hair. Hair could</p>
<p>be braided with hundreds of golden ornaments and pearls</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>that glittered</p>
<p>and tinkled with every movement of the head. Neil concludes: “It would </p>
<p>be dicult to nd in the way of jewellery a vainer or more articial form </p>
<p>of female adornment,”</p>
<p>80</p>
<p> a problem at Ephesus and throughout the prov-</p>
<p>ince of Asia (1 Pet 1:1; 3:3). Zinserling adds that “Jewelry reached the </p>
<p>zenith of extravagance in Hellenistic times ... e hair was knotted on </p>
<p>top of the head, bound up with ribbons, parted and smoothed down, </p>
<p>twisted in plaits around the head.”</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>Xenophon of Ephesus declared that</p>
<p>braided hair and purple chiton made women erotically attractive (Anthia </p>
<p>&amp; Habrocomas I.11.5–6). Braiding of hair was important in some pagan </p>
<p>cults, such as the cult of Artemis of Ephesus or the cult of Isis.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>Paul had</p>
<p>already warned the elders at Ephesus (Acts 20:33) that he did not covet </p>
<p>their gold and expensive apparel, the same words used in this passage </p>
<p>(chrysion, himatismos). He concludes this sentence repeating the earlier </p>
<p>positive action (2:9a) in dierent words: (to adorn themselves) with </p>
<p>what is proper for women professing religion, through good actions </p>
<p>(v. 10). Jerome summarizes: “Let her pearls be of another kind and such </p>
<p>that she may sell them hereaer and buy in their place the pearl that is ‘of </p>
<p>great price’” (Epist. 107.5).</p>
<p>Even though Paul directs these commands (2:8–10) to men and </p>
<p>women in particular, they are not necessarily true of all men and women </p>
<p>everywhere, nor are they necessarily sex-specic in all places. Women </p>
<p>can ght during prayer. Men can aunt their wealth in worship too.</p>
<p>Paul then continues with a clear command: let a woman</p>
<p>83</p>
<p> in si-</p>
<p>lence learn in all submission (2:11), a bold and radical command for </p>
<p>77. Hawkes 1968: 286; see Introduction. Setting. Ephesus and Artemis.</p>
<p>78. In a hendiadys (“one by means of two”) one noun connected by “and” to an-</p>
<p>other noun (here in the same case) functions as an adjective modifying the rst noun. </p>

<p>83. Woman is a more likely translation than “wife” because neither the sentence </p>
<p>nor the context includes a personal pronoun (or even an article) to dierentiate </p>
