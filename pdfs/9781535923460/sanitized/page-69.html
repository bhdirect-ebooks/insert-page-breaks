<p>Godly Peaceful Lives (2:1–15) 53</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Paul’s strategy was rst to speak at the synagogue of each </p>
<p>city where Jews and Gentile God-fearers could hear him.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>Aer encouraging Timothy to begin with prayer at the larger soci-</p>
<p>etal level, Paul wants Timothy to instruct the men and women in peace-</p>
<p>able prayer lifestyles (2:8–10). In Greek, Paul begins verse 8 erefore, </p>
<p>I want to pray the men placing the innitive (to pray) before the direct </p>
<p>object (the men) (erefore, I want the men to pray in every place, </p>
<p>liing holy hands, without anger and disputing [2:8]). Here, Paul uses </p>
<p>anēr to refer to males. Verse 9 begins likewise women leaving out (el-</p>
<p>lipsis) the main verb, the innitive, and the article (I want to pray the). In </p>
<p>this way, verses 8 and 9 are connected. Both sections deal with prayer in </p>
<p>a congregational setting and appropriate lifestyles in the midst of prayer. </p>
<p>Apparently, the men and women had diering problems at Ephesus. </p>
<p>Excursus: Lifting Up Hands </p>
<p>Lifting up one’s hands while standing in prayer was the common ancient way </p>
<p>for men and women to pray. Jesus assumes his disciples will stand praying </p>
<p>(Mark 11:25). Both the Pharisee and the tax-collector stand praying.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>Once</p>
<p>people stood, normally they would lift their hands toward heaven. The hands </p>
<p>represent the human. The lifting of them reach toward and bless God. For </p>
<p>example, when the temple was dedicated, Solomon stood before the altar </p>
<p>and “spread forth his hands toward heaven.”</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>Sometimes the Jews even</p>
<p>lifted up their hands while prostrated on their knees (Ezra 9:5). A regular </p>
<p>part of the Jewish synagogue service was “The Lifting of the Hands” as </p>
<p>a euphemism for prayer. First, benedictions were given including recita-</p>
<p>tion of the Shema’ (“Hear”),</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> and prayer was initiated by the archisynago-</p>
<p>gus (“ruler of the synagogue”) while the congregation stood and afﬁrmed </p>
<p>“Amen,” then the Scripture was read in Hebrew and translated, followed by </p>
<p>an exposition (with the preacher seated), concluding with a blessing (also </p>
<p>called “Lifting of the Hands”).</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>Justin Martyr’s explanation of the second</p>
<p>century Christian service in Rome has many similarities to the Jewish ser-</p>
