<p>1 Timothy 4:1—5:2110</p>
<p>city-states were defeated. Every city had its gymnasium and stadium. In </p>
<p>Ephesus itself a number of gymnasiums have been excavated.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>A Greek</p>
<p>boy from about the age of seven would spend a considerable portion of </p>
<p>each day in the palaestra (a building for teaching wrestling) and gymna-</p>
<p>sium (an athletic ground for exercise, including a running track), exercis-</p>
<p>ing himself under trained supervision. e athletes would box, wrestle, </p>
<p>or practice the pankration.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>Most likely, Timothy’s Greek father would</p>
<p>have brought his son to the local gymnasium as part of his training.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>Paul acknowledges that such physical exercise has some benet (for </p>
<p>a brief time),</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>but spiritual exercise has much benet for all times (4:8).</p>
<p>Training for godliness, like training for war, should be a daily eort un-</p>
<p>der supervision. Godliness is a way to live, dedicating oneself to please </p>
<p>God in one’s words and actions.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>One’s life is oered as worship to God.</p>
<p>For example, Cornelius was a “godly” man who reverenced God, was </p>
<p>generous, and prayed regularly (Acts 10:2). Paul is Timothy’s supervisor, </p>
<p>but only Timothy could do the work, “nourish,” or train himself (4:6). </p>
<p>Spiritual exercise would help Timothy now as he learned how and why </p>
<p>to resist these ungodly storytellers and in the future to receive eternal </p>
<p>salvation (4:7–8; Titus 1:1–2).</p>
<p>He could be sure of this promise because God is a living, saving </p>
<p>God: e word is trustworthy and worthy of all acceptance: for into </p>
<p>this we labor and we strive, since we have hoped upon the living God, </p>
<p>who is Savior of all people, especially of the faithful (4:9–10). is </p>
<p>is Paul’s third authoritative accurate teaching from God in 1 Timothy </p>
<p>expressed in a pithy statement that can be passed on to others as fully </p>
<p>reliable.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>As in 1 Timothy 1:15, the focus is on salvation. Whereas in</p>
<p>1 Timothy 1:15, Paul highlights the incarnate God and why Jesus was </p>
<p>merciful with Paul, although he had persecuted Jesus’ body on earth, the </p>
<p>49. Murphy-O’Connor 2008: 178.</p>
<p>50. Gardiner 1980: 46–47, 72, 84. e pankration is a type of wrestling where </p>
<p>almost any means were allowed (212).</p>
<p>51. Ironically, during the era of Antiochus Epiphanes, promoting the building </p>
<p>of a gymnasium in Jerusalem was one of the outrageous acts that spurred the Jewish </p>
<p>rebellion (1 Macc 1:13–15; 4 Macc 4:15–20).</p>
<p>52. E.g., Jas 4:14; ayer, 443.</p>
<p>53. See Titus 1:1; a way to live (1 Tim 2:2; Titus 2:12); a type of teaching or words </p>
<p>(1 Tim 6:3); the opposite is “profane” (1 Tim 4:7). Godliness is not abstinence (1 Tim </p>
<p>4:3–4) but self-control (Kelly 1963: 99). </p>
<p>54. See 1 Tim 1:15; 3:1; Titus 3:8.</p>
