<p>Godly Peaceful Lives (2:1–15) 51</p>
<p>(2:5). Even though Jesus was born a male, Jesus only uses the generic </p>
<p>self-description human</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>because if Jesus is to represent humans (male</p>
<p>and female) he himself must be “human” rst of all. He is the counterpart </p>
<p>to “the A d a m ,” “humanity” (made of male and female) (Gen 1:26–28). A </p>
<p>mediator (mesitēs) is in a middle (mesos)</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> position between several par-</p>
<p>ties (Gal 3:20), in this case two: God and humans. Job cried out to God </p>
<p>the dilemma: “If I wash myself with soap and cleanse my hands with lye, </p>
<p>yet you will plunge me into lth, and my own clothes will abhor me. For </p>
<p>[God] is not a mortal, as I am, that I might answer him, that we should </p>
<p>come to trial together. ere is no umpire (mesitēs) between us, who might </p>
<p>lay his hand on us both” (Job 9:30–33 NRSV). But, Jesus is this unique </p>
<p>“umpire” or mediator (God and human). As Paul also explains to the </p>
<p>Corinthians, God is “the one reconciling [humans] to himself through </p>
<p>Christ” (2 Cor 5:18). Humans did not obey God’s rst covenant. Jesus set </p>
<p>them free from the sins committed under the rst covenant so that they </p>
<p>could become heirs under a new covenant.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What kind of mediator is Jesus? He is the One having given him-</p>
<p>self as a ransom on behalf of all, the witness to his own times (2:6). </p>
<p>Antilytron</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>hearkens back to Jesus’ words to his disciples: “the Son of</p>
<p>Humanity did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life </p>
<p>a ransom for many.”</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>In that context, Jesus uses his own example as a</p>
<p>model for servant as opposed to tyrant leadership (Matt 20:25–27). In </p>
<p>1 Timothy 2, Paul uses the concept as an explanation of the means by </p>
<p>which God saves all people. It has already been done willingly by Jesus. </p>
<p>Jesus has given his life in exchange for</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>his function as a ransom was</p>
<p>displayed in Jesus’ lifetime, the “lamb” who was sacriced.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>As a witness to Jesus (the One who mediates between God and </p>
<p>humans by having been a ransom), Paul was appointed: for which I my-</p>
<p>self was appointed a herald and an apostle (2:7). A kēryx in ancient </p>
<p>34. Not the usual term for “male,” anēr, though even it sometimes is used for </p>
<p>groups including women. “Son of Man” may be rendered “the Human One” (CEB) or </p>
<p>the Son of Humanity (e.g., Luke 9:58). Spencer 1995: 99–101. See also Strauss 1998: </p>
