<p>Comparison of Greek and an English Translation </p>
<p>inRegardtoGender</p>
<p>221</p>
<p>Literal Greek Translation </p>
<p>ESV Translation</p>
<p>221</p>
<p>“the own house well managing” 3:4 “he must manage his own </p>
<p>household”</p>
<p>“having children” 3:4 “his children”</p>
<p>“the own household ... take care” </p>
<p>3:5</p>
<p>“his own household ... he care”</p>
<p>“not newly planted” 3:6 “he must not be a recent convert”</p>
<p>“having been deluded ... might </p>
<p>fall” 3:6</p>
<p>“he may become pued up with </p>
<p>conceit and fall”</p>
<p>“to have a good testimony ... </p>
<p>might fall” 3:7</p>
<p>“he must be well thought of ... he </p>
<p>may not fall”</p>
<p>Nowhere does the Greek text have a masculine pronoun in 3:4–7 except </p>
<p>for the modier own (idios, idia, idion) of household (oikos, 3:4, 5). </p>
<p>Since own modies the noun household (oikos), it must be grammati-</p>
<p>cally “masculine,” in this case an o declension. Episkopos (overseer) as </p>
<p>an antecedent also has a “masculine” or o declension. In the same way, </p>
<p>“conscience” (syneidēsis) has a “feminine” or a declension in 4:2 (the </p>
<p>same pronoun as in 3:4, 5 own), although no one would argue that only </p>
<p>females were aected by seared consciences. We here are concerned with </p>
<p>grammatical gender that has to do with class or kind, a way to categorize </p>
<p>words, not sex or real gender.</p>
<p>222</p>
<p> </p>
<p>us, in summary, probably the translations “faithful in marriage” </p>
<p>(CEV) or “faithful to their spouse” (3:2 CEB) render best the intention </p>
<p>of the more literal a one-woman man. Further, the overseer’s relation-</p>
<p>ship with his (or her) spouse is an important, but not the only, quality </p>
<p>for leadership. How can people be faithful and persistent in following </p>
<p>God if they can not be faithful and persistent in their earthly one-esh </p>
<p>relationship?</p>
<p>223</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Both the lists of elders’ qualications in 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1 in-</p>
<p>clude references to not being open to attack from outsiders, to cultivating </p>
<p>221. e ESV renders the generic tis as “someone” (3:5).</p>
<p>222. See Spencer 1995: 121–25. In addition, in Hebrew (and in English) and some-</p>
<p>times in Greek “the masculine as prior gender includes the feminine” (GKC, 391).</p>
<p>223. See also 1 John 4:20.</p>
