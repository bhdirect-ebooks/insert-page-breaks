<p>e Law for the Unrighteous Not the Righteous (1:8–11) 31</p>
<p>regarded and were given places of honor at banquets and synagogues.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e law and study of it were highly esteemed. Rabbi Meir explains: “He </p>
<p>that occupies himself in the study of the Law for its own sake ... is de-</p>
<p>serving of the whole world. He is called friend, beloved of God, lover of </p>
<p>God, lover of mankind ... And it gives him kingship and dominion and </p>
<p>discernment in judgement; to him are revealed the secrets of the Law.”</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No wonder Josephus concludes his history by explaining that the Jewish </p>
<p>people “give credit for wisdom to those alone who have an exact knowl-</p>
<p>edge of the law and who are capable of interpreting the meaning of the </p>
<p>Holy Scriptures.” He adds, “though many have laboriously undertaken </p>
<p>this training, scarcely two or three have succeeded” (Ant. 20.12 [264–65]).</p>
<p>No wonder the Ephesians wanted to become teachers of the law. </p>
<p>However, in contrast to a genuine teacher of the law, the Ephesians, even </p>
<p>though they spoke with authority, had no spiritual understanding (1:7). </p>
<p>Paul, who did, rarely defended himself by referring to the Jewish oral </p>
<p>laws.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p> In his own writings, law normally refers to the Scriptures, usu-</p>
<p>ally the Pentateuch and sometimes the Prophets,</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>as in 1 Timothy 1:8–9,</p>
<p>where “law” appears to refer to Moses’ laws.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Law for the Unrighteous Not the Righteous (1:8–11)</p>
<p>Both Paul and the church recognized the value of the law: But we know </p>
<p>that the law is good (1:8).</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>However, Paul adds a conditional clause:</p>
<p>if someone makes use of it lawfully, explaining: knowing this, that </p>
<p>to the righteous law is not given, but to the lawless and disobedient, </p>
<p>godless and sinners, unholy and profane, patricides and matricides, </p>
<p>68. Matt 23:6–7. See also m. ‘Abot 3:19; 4:6; 6:3; Jeremias 1969: 237–40.</p>
<p>69. M. ‘Abot 6:1. See also m. ‘Abot 1:2; 3:6, 8; 6:6, 7. </p>
<p>70. See Acts 22:3; 25:8; Phil 3:5.</p>
<p>71. Ten commandments: Rom 2:17–22; 4:14; 5:13; 7:1–7; 13:8–9; Moses’ laws: Acts </p>
<p>23:3; 1 Cor 9:8–9; Gal 4:21–23; Eph 2:15; Prophets: Rom 3:10–19; 1 Cor 14:21. Paul </p>
<p>also uses nomos to describe a principle (Rom 3:27; 7:21–25; 8:2); as a contrast to grace </p>
<p>(Rom 4:16; 6:14; 10:4; 1 Cor 9:20; Gal 2:21).</p>
<p>72. Paul refers to serious crimes mentioned in the O.T. in 1:9–11, such as murder </p>
<p>(because humans are created in God’s image) (Gen 9:6; Exod 20:13; Lev 24:17) honor-</p>
<p>ing parents (Exod 20:12; Lev 19:3; Exod 21:15, 17), adultery (Deut 22:20–27), ho-</p>
<p>mosexual behavior, lying (Lev 18:22; 19:11–12; Exod 20:16), and selling slaves (Exod </p>
<p>21:16; Deut 24:7). In contrast, in Roman society tracking in slaves was a regular, </p>
<p>daily event (Bradley 1994: 2, 7–8). </p>
<p>73. See also Rom 7:12.</p>
