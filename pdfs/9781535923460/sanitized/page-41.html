<p>Not to Teach Dierent Doctrine, but Rather Love (1:3–7) 25</p>
<p>his disciples ahead to prepare his way, even as John the Baptist prepared </p>
<p>the people for Jesus.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Timothy’s rst directive is a negative one. Timothy needs to trans-</p>
<p>mit a message to some (tis, 1:3). Tis may be masculine, feminine, or even </p>
<p>neuter.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> us, the false teachers could be men and/or women.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Most</p>
<p>of the time, tis is used negatively to refer to people who are not ortho-</p>
<p>dox in doctrine or practice. ey are teachers of heterodoxy occupied </p>
<p>with myths and genealogies (1:3–4); they deviate from positive attributes </p>
<p>(1:5–6, 19); their talk is untruthful; their teaching is without knowledge </p>
<p>(1:6–7), they renounce the faith (4:1), teach false doctrine (6:3, 20–21), </p>
<p>follow Satan (5:15), and love money (6:10).</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>Among them are two men</p>
<p>(Hymenaeus and Alexander, 1:20) and younger widows (5:15).</p>
<p>Heterodidaskaleō (1:3) was probably coined by Paul</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>to refer</p>
<p>to teaching what is not healthy or true (6:3). Instead of turning their </p>
<p>thoughts and time toward</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>reading Scripture, advocacy for others, and</p>
<p>teaching (4:13), they have turned toward myths and endless genealo-</p>
<p>gies which give rise to speculations (1:4). Some may have turned toward </p>
<p>drinking intoxicating substances (3:8). Others have turned toward ascet-</p>
<p>ism, taught by “deceitful spirits and demonic teachings” (4:1). Myths and </p>
<p>genealogies also occur in Titus.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>e Greek historian Polybius recounts</p>
<p>that “the genealogical side (genealogikos) appeals to those who are fond </p>
<p>of a story,” who want to be entertained, whereas Polybius himself is in-</p>
<p>terested in actual events, as a student of politics (Hist. 9.1.4–5; 2.4). us, </p>
<p>myths are untruthful legends. Paul does not describe these myths. But, </p>
<p>they were no doubt similar to those in Crete. Ephesus, too, had many </p>
<p>myths about Artemis.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>In Titus, Paul describes the myths as “Jewish”</p>
<p>and “human commandments” (1:14), while the genealogies are “foolish” </p>

<p>26. Tis is used as a neuter twice (1:10: 6:7). It is used inclusively in a positive or </p>
<p>neutral manner ve times (1 Tim 1:8; 3:1, 5; 5:4, 16; Titus 1:6; 2 Tim 2:5, 21; 3:2).</p>

<p>28. “Only in Christian wr.,” BDAG, 399. Paul used hetero combined with other </p>
<p>words in 1 Cor 14:21 and 2 Cor 6:14 (heteroglōssos) and heterozugeō) and he refers to </p>
<p>“another (heteros) gospel” in Gal 1:6. </p>
