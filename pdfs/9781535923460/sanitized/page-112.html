<p>1 Timothy 2–396</p>
<p>but has now been revealed,</p>
<p>292</p>
<p>especially by an apostle or prophet from</p>
<p>God through the Spirit to believers oen about Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>293</p>
<p>At times,</p>
<p>mystery refers to specic information, an aspect of the gospel,</p>
<p>294</p>
<p>at other</p>
<p>times it refers to the gospel as a whole entity, or to Jesus Christ as a synec-</p>
<p>doche for the gospel.</p>
<p>295</p>
<p>e meaning of mystery may be summarized by</p>
<p>King Nebuchadnezzar’s discovery that Daniel’s God “is the God of gods </p>
<p>and the Lord of kings, the one revealing mysteries” (Dan 2:47). Daniel </p>
<p>had told him that the interpretation that he had received was not one de-</p>
<p>duced by logic but only by revelation by the God in heaven (Dan 2:18–19, </p>
<p>27–30). Paul writes this confession to remind Timothy for the Christian </p>
<p>leaders to teach and proclaim to others. It is written as a summary of the </p>
<p>key events witnessed by a variety of sources to be presented to the larger </p>
<p>public as well as the church. All these events have been recorded in the </p>
<p>two volume work of Paul’s companion Luke.</p>
<p>e confession (3:16) covers Jesus’ whole life from the incarna-</p>
<p>tion (manifested in the esh), his life (was declared righteous in the </p>
<p>spirit), resurrection (was seen by angels), early apostolic witness (was </p>
<p>proclaimed among nations), response to apostolic proclamation (was </p>
<p>believed in the world), and ascension (was taken up in glory). e con-</p>
<p>fession is almost a perfect parallelism, each clause consisting of a verb, a </p>
<p>preposition, an object.</p>
<p>296</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e concept of mystery is further communicated by the verb </p>
<p>phaneroō (to manifest or “to make manifest or visible or known what </p>
<p>292. E.g., e message of the kingdom of heaven is given to disciples clearly to </p>
<p>understand but explained in parables to the large crowds (Matt 13:10–11); prepared </p>
<p>for those who love God (1 Cor 2:7–9), not revealed in the past but revealed now (Eph </p>
<p>3:5; Col 1:26–27).</p>
<p>293. 1 Cor 2:10; 13:2; Eph 3:3–5; Rom 16:25.</p>
<p>294. E.g., a hardening has come upon part of Israel (Rom 11:25); humans will be </p>
<p>changed in a ash, the dead will be raised imperishable (1 Cor 15:51–52); the plan is </p>
<p>to gather all things in God (Eph 1:9–10); Gentiles are fellow heirs (Eph 3:3–10; Col </p>
<p>1:26–27); two become one esh (Eph 5:31–32).</p>
<p>295. Matt 13:11; 1 Cor 2:1–2, 7–8; Col 1:27; 2:2–3; 1 Cor 4:1; Eph 6:19. For an </p>
<p>extended study of the meaning of mustērion from ancient to contemporary times, see </p>
<p>Spencer 1992: 2–11.</p>
<p>296. However, was seen by angels has no preposition in the Greek. erefore, this </p>
<p>verse may be poetical, but it is not tight enough to call it a “hymn.” Paul does not </p>
<p>hesitate to cite when a phrase comes from another author, using legō (“said”), e.g., </p>
<p>Titus 1:12; Acts 17:28. Fiorenza (1975: 19) points out that “no direct record of early </p>
<p>Christian hymns ... exists.”</p>
