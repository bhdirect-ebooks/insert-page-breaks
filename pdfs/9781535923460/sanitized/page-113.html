<p>Godly Overseeing (3:1–16) 97</p>
<p>has been hidden or unknown,” 3:16).</p>
<p>297</p>
<p>For God to become incarnate</p>
<p>would be incomprehensible to a Jew.</p>
<p>298</p>
<p>How can God, who is a Spirit,</p>
<p>become esh? How could the immortal God become mortal? Philo aptly </p>
<p>summarizes this Jewish perspective. In criticism of Emperor Gaius, who </p>
<p>intended to have his statue placed in the temple of Jerusalem and who at-</p>
<p>tired himself daily in the guise of dierent deities, Philo responds that the </p>
<p>“Jews alone” opposed Gaius because they acknowledged the “one God </p>
<p>who is the Father and Maker of the world.” He adds that “deication” is </p>
<p>“the most grievous impiety, since sooner could God change into a man </p>
<p>than a man into God” (Embassy 16 [115, 118]). For some Gentiles, what </p>
<p>would be remarkable is the assumption that the esh was good enough </p>
<p>for God to embrace because they would instead see matter as baser, as </p>
Plato explains: God constructed “things divine” but commanded mortal
<p>things to be made by “engendered sons” (dēmiourgos).</p>
<p>299</p>
<p>Such a sentiment would be part of what would cause some at Ephe-</p>
<p>sus to forbid marriage and demand abstinence because they would see </p>
<p>esh as evil (4:3–4; cf. 1 John 4:2). e Christian witness instead is that </p>
<p>God in Christ Jesus (3:13, 15) “became esh and dwelled among us.”</p>
<p>300</p>
<p> </p>
<p>God had to become human esh in order to atone for human sin.</p>
<p>301</p>
<p>His</p>
<p>blood had to be shed as the perfect sacrice for a perfect God.</p>
<p>302</p>
<p>It was</p>
<p>in his esh that the Messiah suered.</p>
<p>303</p>
<p>Consequently, it was in his esh</p>
<p>that Christ Jesus reconciled Jew and Gentile (Eph 2:14).</p>
<p>e next clause is dicult to understand since pneuma can refer to </p>
<p>the Holy Spirit or the human spirit</p>
<p>304</p>
<p>and dikaioō itself may be rendered</p>
<p>in a variety of ways: </p>
<p>297. ayer, 648.</p>
<p>298. See Titus 2:13.</p>
<p>299. Tim. 42D, 69C, 74E. Instead of being resurrected bodily, the person who lived </p>
<p>his appointed time well returned again to his “abode in his native star” but whoever </p>
<p>did not live well would be changed into a woman at the second birth (Tim. 42B, 90E).</p>
<p>300. John 1:14; Luke 1:31–33; 2:6–7.</p>
<p>301. E.g., 1 Tim 1:15; Rom 8:3; Phil 2:6–7.</p>
<p>302. Col 1:22; Heb 10:19–20.</p>
<p>303. Luke 24:26; 1 Cor 1:23; Heb 5:7; 1 Pet 3:18; 4:1.</p>
<p>304. In the Pastorals, pneuma can be used to refer to humans (2 Tim 1:7) and to </p>
<p>God (1 Tim 4:1; 2 Tim 1:14; Titus 3:5).</p>
