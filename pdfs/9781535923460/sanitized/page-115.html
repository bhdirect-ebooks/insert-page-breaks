<p>Godly Overseeing (3:1–16) 99</p>
<p>“preacher” or “herald, especially to Gentiles.”</p>
<p>308</p>
<p>Timothy will be exhorted</p>
<p>to “preach the word” in all circumstances and Paul would proclaim the </p>
<p>kērugma (“proclamation,” “message”) in Rome (2 Tim 4:2, 17). </p>
<p>Ethnos (3:16) may refer to nations or more specically “Gentiles,” </p>
<p>non-Jews. Elsewhere in the Pastorals, ethnos refers to Gentiles,</p>
<p>309</p>
<p>but in</p>
<p>the context of this confession the meaning may be broader, alluding to </p>
<p>Jesus’ great commission (Matt 28:19) and parallel to world (1 Tim 3:16). </p>
<p>e goal of preaching is for listeners to believe in the One about whom </p>
<p>one preaches (Rom 10:14). Paul and Timothy’s travels throughout the </p>
<p>ancient world, from Asia Minor to Macedonia, Greece, and Rome have </p>
<p>been documented in Acts. e readers of the Pastorals in Asia Minor and </p>
<p>Crete are believers of their message and part of the world Jesus came to </p>
<p>save.</p>
<p>310</p>
<p>Paul concludes with the ascension of Jesus (was taken up in glory, </p>
<p>3:16). is event is only recorded in Luke and Acts when the disciples see </p>
<p>Jesus “lied up” and a cloud took him out of their sight.</p>
<p>311</p>
<p> Key require-</p>
<p>ments for apostles were to have been with Jesus until he ascended (Acts </p>
<p>1:21–22). Analambanō (to take up)</p>
<p>312</p>
<p>in the passive voice implies that</p>
<p>Jesus did not ascend on his own power or initiative but was taken,</p>
<p>313</p>
<p> </p>
<p>similar to “was raised” by God.</p>
<p>314</p>
<p>e verb literally oen has a sense of</p>
<p>movement from one place to another, as moving from land to a boat.</p>
<p>315</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oen the resurrection and ascension of Christ is followed by a statement </p>
<p>that God the Father caused Jesus to be seated at his right in a place of </p>
<p>armation and authority.</p>
<p>316</p>
<p> Jesus is encased in glory in heaven.</p>

<p>313. Other verbs used for the ascension (anapherō [“was taken away”] and epairō </p>
<p>[“was lied up”]) are also used in the passive voice (Luke 24:51; Acts 1:9; cf. 1 Pet 3:22).</p>
