<p>Pursue Righteousness (6:11–16) 157</p>
<p>model for Timothy himself.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>Paul earlier had reminded Timothy of his</p>
<p>own confession (6:12).</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>Timothy, as Jesus before him, had made good</p>
<p>confessions before witnesses.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a “soldier” of Christ Jesus, Timothy is to guard (6:14). Is the </p>
<p>command spotless and not open to attack</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> or is Timothy being com-</p>
<p>manded to be spotless and not open to attack?</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>Probably the latter ts</p>
<p>better in the context. Spotless and not open to attack are adjectives and </p>
<p>most likely refer to Timothy’s own manner of guarding. Spotless (aspilos) </p>
<p>alludes to the previous references to purity (4:12; 5:2). Jesus is spotless, </p>
<p>a lamb “without defect” (1 Pet 1:19). Spilos is a type of sin that contami-</p>
<p>nates and spreads.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>Timothy, like elders and widows, should not become</p>
<p>discredited from within or outside the church (not open to attack).</p>
<p>95</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Perseverance is needed until Christ returns in the time God has cho-</p>
<p>sen (6:14–15).</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>Whom Jesus Christ reveals is described in an extended</p>
<p>clause with three parallel subjects:</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>(1) the blessed and only ruler, (2)</p>
<p>89. In 1 Tim 2:6, Jesus is described as “the witness to his own times.”</p>
<p>90. Homologia (v. 12) is the same word as in v. 13.</p>
<p>91. Martyria (v. 12), martyreō (v. 13). e Gospel of John records the event to </p>
<p>which Paul alludes (John 18:33–38). As instructive to Timothy, Jesus describes his </p>
<p>own kingdom as not having armed combat (agōnizomai). See 1 Tim 6:12. Jesus picks </p>
<p>up on Pilate’s statement that Jesus is a king (John 18:37; 1 Tim 6:15). Jesus also tells </p>
<p>Pilate that he came to witness to the truth, an important theme in 1 Tim (2:4, 7; 3:15; </p>
<p>4:3; 6:5). Pilate also represents a Greco-Roman non-Christian listener (e.g., 2:1–2; 3:2, </p>
<p>7; 5:7–8, 10, 14). </p>
<p>92. Both adjectives are in the accusative case, the same case as command (Lock </p>
<p>1924: 72; Kelly 1963: 145; Mounce 2000: 359–60).</p>
<p>93. Marshall 1999: 665; Towner 2006: 415; Lock 1924: 72. In Matt 19:17 keeping </p>
<p>the commandments results in life.</p>
<p>94. Jas 3:6; Jude 23; Spencer et al. 2009: 90.</p>
<p>95. 1 Tim 3:2; 5:7; Titus 1:6. What command does Paul have in mind? In Titus </p>
<p>1:14, Paul refers to Jewish myths as human commandments. Does Paul, in contrast, </p>
<p>in 1 Tim 6:14 refer to God’s principles: stewardship of God’s household, the one in </p>
<p>faith, the goal of this order is love from a clean heart and a good conscience and a </p>
<p>genuine faith (1:4–5)? Or does he refer to the previous sentence: keep on ghting </p>
<p>for yourself the good ght of the faith, grasp for yourself eternal life (6:12) or to </p>
<p>another earlier command to Timothy (4:16)? (Fee 1988: 151–52); charge given at bap-</p>
<p>tism (Lock 1924: 72; Kelly 1963: 144); entire Christian gospel (Marshall 1999: 664–65; </p>
<p>Montague 2008: 129); or entire letter (Mounce 2000: 359). Most likely he refers to </p>
<p>1:4–5 since he had also described those words as an order (parangelia), comparable to </p>
<p>the charge (parangellō) in 6:13.</p>
<p>96. Matt 24:36–39; 25:13; Acts 1:6–7.</p>
<p>97. Each phrase begins with an article. e relative pronoun hēn (which, 6:15) </p>
