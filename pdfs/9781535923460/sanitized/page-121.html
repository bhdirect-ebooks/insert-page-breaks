<p>e perfect tense indicates that what was done to the conscience</p>
<p>was done in the past but it has a long term eect. In a similar way, the </p>
<p>deception of Eve entered her into a state of transgression (1 Tim 2:14). </p>
<p>e ability to deceive and be deceived involved a hypocrisy enabled by </p>
<p>blocking o the ability to discern good from evil.</p>
<p>Yet, what could appear more pious than ascetism? If a conscience </p>
<p>(4:2) has been burned so that it no longer can discern good from evil, </p>
<p>one would expect that that person would be like an Epicurean, or, like a </p>
<p>Gentile, “living in licentiousness, passions, drunkenness, revels, carous-</p>
<p>ing, and lawless idolatry,” in “excesses of dissipation” (1 Pet 4:3–4 NRSV) </p>
<p>or “wild” (Titus 1:6). However, these instead are ascetic, forbidding mar-</p>
<p>riage and the eating of certain foods (1 Tim 4:3). Paul thus reminds us </p>
<p>that a seared conscience can result in an ascetic as well as a dissolute </p>
<p>lifestyle. A healthy conscience can discern subtlety and it can dialogue </p>
<p>within itself and with others about more dicult questions of morality. </p>
<p>For instance, although Paul might recommend to believers the benets of </p>
<p>being single, yet he allows the possibility of marriage (1 Cor 7:1–16). He </p>
<p>encourages some widows to remain single, while others to marry (1Tim </p>
<p>5:9–14).</p>
<p>is ascetic strain can be found both in some Jewish and Gentile </p>
<p>communities.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Although most ancient Jews were strongly supportive of</p>
<p>marriage because of God’s command to humanity to “be fruitful and </p>
<p>multiply” (Gen 1:28; 9:7) (exemplied by one order of the Essenes who </p>
<p>thought that those who “decline to marry cut o the chief function of life, </p>
<p>the propagation of the race”), other Essenes did not encourage marriage. </p>
<p>For example, Josephus describes one order of the Essenes, whose diet was </p>
<p>strict, also shunning “pleasures as a vice” and disdaining marriage. He </p>
<p>said, they do not “on principle, condemn wedlock and the propagation </p>
<p>thereby of the race, but they wish to protect themselves against women’s </p>
<p>wantonness, being persuaded that none of the sex keeps her plighted </p>
<p>troth to one man.” ey thought only the soul is immortal and imperish-</p>
<p>able entangled in the “prison-house of the body.” However, unlike the </p>
