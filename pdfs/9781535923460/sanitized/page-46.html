<p>Excursus: Women Could Desire to Be Teachers 30</p>
<p>even though the situation may have been become better for Gentile women </p>
<p>since many women were no longer forbidden to pursue higher education, </p>
<p>still very few women were teaching in a professional sense in salaried posi-</p>
<p>tions in great houses or running a school as a sophist.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>Many Athenian</p>
<p>and Eastern women were still sequestered in the home, married women in </p>
<p>Ephesus (at least in the second century A.D.) even being forbidden to enter </p>
<p>the temple of Artemis.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>Early marriage limited opportunities for women.</p>
<p>The learned professions were still usually reserved for men. Women were </p>
<p>also excluded from law schools, since arguing publicly in court was forbid-</p>
<p>den, being considered “immodest.”</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thus, when confronted with heterodox teaching and learning, neither </p>
<p>the Jewish nor Gentile women may have been well prepared to withstand </p>
<p>it. Further, what little teaching the Gentile women in Ephesus did receive </p>
<p>might have been syncretistic. </p>
<p>Paul himself was an accurate teacher of the law (nomodidaskalos, </p>
<p>1:7) aer his years of study as a Pharisee following his own teacher, Rabbi </p>
<p>Gamaliel.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>A teacher of the law is synonymous with, or even superior</p>
<p>to, a scribe, since Gamaliel was head of a school.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>A devout Jewish youth</p>
<p>would begin study of the Scriptures at ve, study of the interpretation </p>
<p>and application of the Scriptures (the Mishnah) at ten, and study of the </p>
<p>Talmud (the scholars’ interpretation of the Mishnah) at een (m. ‘Abot </p>
<p>5:21). A scholar might be ordained as a teacher at forty to become an </p>
<p>academic professional involved in a career in justice, government, and/or </p>
<p>education. For the Jews, knowledge of scriptural exegesis was the deter-</p>
<p>mining factor in judicial decisions. ese doctors of the law were highly </p>
<p>(Pomeroy 1975: 131, 136–39; Pomeroy 1984: 66–71; Goodwater 1975: 15). </p>
<p>63. Winter 2003: 116. </p>
<p>64. Pomeroy 1975: 189. Artemidorus Daldianus (of Ephesus) (Onir. 4.4) wrote </p>
<p>that death is the penalty for a married woman who entered the temple of Artemis of </p>
<p>Ephesus; Bennett 1967: 33.</p>
<p>65. Winter 2003: 178. Nevertheless, a few Roman women gave public speeches </p>
<p>(Pomeroy 1975: 175–76).</p>
<p>66. Acts 5:34; 22:3; 26:5; Phil 3:5–6. See also Luke 5:17.</p>
<p>67. E.g., Zenas, Titus 3:13; Plummer 1922: 152; Robertson 2005: 87; Bruce 1990: </p>
<p>175.</p>
