<p>1 Timothy 4:1—5:2112</p>
<p>“instruct” or “explain,” as Jesus did, aer commanding one leper to be </p>
<p>healed, then giving him further instructions: “to tell no one. ‘Go,’ he said, </p>
<p>‘and show yourself to the priest, and, as Moses commanded, make an </p>
<p>oering for your cleansing, for a testimony to them.’”</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Teach (didaskō, 4:11) has a causative sense, to cause to learn.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> It im-</p>
<p>plies not only explanation but repetition because the ancients, including </p>
<p>the Jews, taught mainly by repetition. In the mishnah stage of education </p>
<p>(literally, “to repeat”), the Beth-Talmud, teachers would repeat aloud texts </p>
<p>again and again (at least four times) and pupils would repeat again and </p>
<p>again. For instance, Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrkanos said: “A man’s duty is to </p>
<p>repeat (a passage) to his pupil four times” (b. ‘Erub. 54b), and Hillel adds: </p>
<p>“e man who repeats his chapter a hundred times is not to be compared </p>
<p>with the man who repeats it one hundred and one times” (b. Hag. 9b). </p>
<p>In the advanced talmud stage of “learning,” the Beth Ha-Midrash, the </p>
<p>student memorized texts and studied their meanings.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>e same type of</p>
<p>practice continued even with the early church fathers. Irenaeus observed </p>
<p>how Polycarp “repeated” the words of John and others from “memory” </p>
<p>and also “proclaimed” them in “complete harmony with Scripture” (Eu-</p>
<p>sebius, Hist. eccl. 5.20.6). us, Timothy too was not simply to command </p>
<p>the female and male believers at Ephesus but to instruct them and to </p>
<p>teach them about wrong and correct doctrine and behavior.</p>
<p>Paul continues with advice for Timothy about how to live in a godly </p>
<p>way as a leader among the believers at Ephesus. To begin, let no one </p>
<p>despise your youth, instead keep on becoming an example to the ones </p>
<p>believing in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity (4:12). Paul </p>
<p>commands Timothy that his youth is not to be despised.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>He uses the</p>
<p>same root (phroneō, “to form or hold an opinion”) that he used with </p>
<p>Titus.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>However, in 1 Timothy he uses a dierent prex (kata, “down,”</p>
<p>vs. peri, “around”). Kata clearly gives the verb a negative connotation: </p>
<p>66. Luke 5:13–14 NRSV. See also 1 Tim 1:3–5; 5:7; 6:13–17; Acts 1:4–5; Matt 10:5; </p>
<p>1 Cor 7:10–11; 11:17.</p>
<p>67. Verbs terminating in –skō generally are inchoative or causative (Robertson </p>
<p>1934: 150; see also 2:12).</p>
<p>68. For example, Resh Laqish went to Eleazar three days to repeat a tradition and </p>
<p>three months to penetrate the meaning and usage of the material (b. Yebam. 72b). See </p>
<p>Gerhardsson 1961: 115, 117, 134.</p>
<p>69. See 1 Tim 1:2 on “Timothy.”</p>
<p>70. See Titus 2:15.</p>
