<p>1 Timothy 5:3—6:2142</p>
<p>Slaves (6:1–2)</p>
<p>Paul now moves from widows and elders to slaves: As many are slaves </p>
<p>under the yoke regard their own masters worthy of all honor, lest </p>
<p>God’s name and the teaching may be slandered. But the ones having </p>
<p>faithful masters do not despise, since they are brothers and sisters, </p>
<p>but more serve, since they are faithful and beloved, the ones devot-</p>
<p>ing themselves to good deeds (6:1–2a). Unlike Aristotle, who addresses </p>
<p>only masters, Paul in 6:1–2 and in Titus 2:9–10 addresses only slaves, </p>
<p>probably household slaves.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>Possibly, the slaves’ attitudes were aected</p>
<p>by the general rancor against masters and enslavement. In ancient times, </p>
<p>people became slaves in dierent ways: instead of capital punishment, </p>
<p>they might serve a penal service, exposed children were forced into </p>
<p>slavery,</p>
<p>111</p>
<p> captives of war,</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>pirates, and debtors. Many slaves labored</p>
<p>in domestic and mining areas. Some estimate that one-third of urban </p>
<p>residents were slaves. Manumission was more common in domestic and </p>
<p>urban employments than in mining. Some Roman slaves were given a </p>
<p>peculium (money or property) from which the slaves eventually bought </p>
<p>their freedom. Slaves were of any race, oen encouraged to be educated, </p>
<p>could own property, and were oen emancipated.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p> Many slaves were ac-</p>
<p>quired by slave-traders, whom Paul includes among the lawless and god-</p>
<p>less (1:10). e most famous organized ancient slaving system was based </p>
<p>in southwestern Asia Minor. Ephesus itself was a major slave-market for </p>
<p>at least four hundred years.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>Strabo describes the pirates from Cilicia as</p>
<p>exporting slaves because of the prot. e main market was Delos, which </p>
<p>could admit and export ten thousand slaves on the same day. An ancient </p>
<p>proverb noted the quick sale of slaves: “Merchant, sail in, unload your </p>
<p>ship, everything has been sold” (Strabo, Geogr. 14.5.2 [C668–69]).</p>
<p>110. See Titus 2:9; cf. Eph 6:5–9; Col 3:22–4:1. Towner 2006: 382. While Stoic phi-</p>
<p>losophers addressed their peers about equality, Christian teachers addressed the slaves </p>
<p>directly “in their own right.” Christianity oered its adherents “an equality of religious </p>
<p>opportunity” previously unknown (Bradley 1994: 145, 150).</p>
<p>111. Cohick (2009: 40–42) observes that more females than males were exposed. </p>
<p>Jews, on the other hand, condemned exposure of infants.</p>
<p>112. Just from the Jewish war of A.D. 66–70, the Romans enslaved 130,230 Jews </p>
<p>(Bradley 1994: 40).</p>
<p>113. Montague 2008: 119. Augustine said it was the practice of Christian com-</p>
<p>munities to redeem as many of the kidnapped slaves as possible (Bradley 1994: 37, 81).</p>
