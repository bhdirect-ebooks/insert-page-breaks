<p>True Widows and Younger Widows (5:3–16) 129</p>
<p>take care of parents and grandparents is insisted upon (5:4). In contrast </p>
<p>to the ascetic lifestyle, Paul normally promotes for the Christian a life of </p>
<p>armation of marriage and food, receiving God’s creational gis with </p>
<p>thanksgiving (4:3–4). Children, childbirth, marriage are all part of God’s </p>
<p>gis that should be welcomed, since Paul’s ultimate goal is to encour-</p>
<p>age the younger widows to go ahead and remarry (5:14), yet Paul as a </p>
<p>single man also adopts, and is adopted into, the Christian household, </p>
<p>childrearing and hospitality</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>being physical actions that demonstrate</p>
<p>love for others. ey are helpful to the outside community (5:7, 10), but </p>
<p>they also are ways to worship God (be “godly” or show piety, 5:4). And, </p>
<p>what about the widow who never could have children? Paul does not use </p>
<p>the word for bearing children (teknogoneō, 5:14), but, rather, for bring-</p>
<p>ing up children (teknotropheō, 5:10). Worshiping in a household church </p>
<p>would aord opportunities to help all. </p>
<p>And, why must the real widow wash the feet of holy ones (5:10) or </p>
<p>other believers? is passage appears to be a reference to Jesus’ teaching </p>
<p>to his disciples to imitate his own example when he washed their feet as </p>
<p>a slave might have done (John 13:5–17). Washing of feet is a concrete </p>
<p>example of humble service in the church.</p>
<p>Finally, even as a widow is an example of someone who might easily </p>
<p>be oppressed (5:10), the widow herself should have been compassionate </p>
<p>and helpful to others who have been oppressed: widows and orphans (Jas </p>
<p>1:27), Christians who have been persecuted,</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>including people such as</p>
<p>Paul and Timothy, who greatly suered when they ministered in Asia (2 </p>
<p>Cor 1:4–9), Christians who have encountered diculties in ministry (2 </p>
<p>Cor 4:8; 7:5), and others who have suered.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For someone to dedicate their last years to continual prayer, their </p>
<p>prayers would be more focused and empathetic if they had had a well-</p>
<p>rounded life of service in the church and their commitment would have </p>
<p>more integrity if they had become a mature Christian (and not “newly </p>
<p>planted,” 3:6). Paul closes this sentence by reiterating with emphasis that </p>
<p>37. See 1 Tim 3:2.</p>
<p>38. Matt 13:21; 24:9; John 16:33; Acts 11:19; 14:22; 20:23; Eph 3:13; 1 ess 1:6; </p>
<p>3:3–4, 7; 2 ess 1:4; Heb 10:33; 11:37.</p>
<p>39. Matt 24:21; John 16:21; Acts 7:10–11; Rom 5:3; 12:12; 1 Cor 7:28; 2 Cor 4:17; </p>
<p>6:4; 7:4; 8:2, 13; Phil 1:17; 4:14; Col 1:24. Oppress (thlibō, thlipsis), literally, refers to a </p>
<p>“narrow” way or being crushed in a narrow way (Matt 7:14; Mark 3:9) and, metaphori-</p>
<p>cally, to hardships, diculties, persecutions, punishments (Rom 2:9), and internal (2 </p>
<p>Cor 2:4) and external or general suering.</p>
