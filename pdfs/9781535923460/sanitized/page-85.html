<p>Godly Peaceful Lives (2:1–15) 69</p>
<p>kuk, too, declares God “formed” him in order to “discipline his train-</p>
<p>ing” (paideia, 1:12 LXX). e psalmist reminds God that God “made </p>
<p>me and formed me,” which then leads to the request he be instructed </p>
<p>so that he can learn (manthanō) God’s commandments (118:73). e </p>
<p>Athenian in Plato’s dialogue on Laws describes the “good legislator” who </p>
<p>trains (paideuō) and also molds (plassō) with laws the banqueter who is </p>
<p>“unwilling to submit to the proper limits of silence and speech” (Leg. II. </p>
<p>671C). Plato also describes stories that nurses and mothers tell children </p>
<p>in order to “form their souls” (Resp. II. 377C).</p>
<p>us, in this wordplay, Paul describes Adam as formed literally and </p>
<p>also metaphorically (2:13). God exhorted Adam: “You are free to eat from </p>
<p>any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowl-</p>
<p>edge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will certainly die” (Gen </p>
<p>2:16–17 TNIV). Eve had not yet been created. Aerwards, God educates </p>
<p>Adam why he needs “help equal to himself,”</p>
<p>149</p>
<p> which no other created be-</p>
<p>ing can satisfy, before he creates Eve (2:18–22). Adam was created before </p>
<p>Eve and also educated before Eve. In the same way as Paul is the rst or </p>
<p>prototype of all sinners (1:13–16), a prototype of someone sinful (but </p>
<p>ignorant) who receives God’s mercy, Adam is a prototype of someone </p>
<p>born and educated rst.</p>
<p>Verse 13 then follows from to be in silence (2:12). Others interpret </p>
<p>verse 13 in light of authentein in verse 12, thereby claiming that verse 13 </p>
<p>shows God’s prescriptive intention of male authority and male church </p>
<p>leadership.</p>
<p>150</p>
<p>However, authentein is a weak basis on which to establish</p>
<p>male authority because of its negative connotation in pre-ecclesiastical </p>
<p>usage and the rarity of its usage in the New Testament. In contrast, in my </p>
<p>opinion, these commentators do not clearly show how verse 13 relates </p>
<p>to verse 14.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p>Since vv. 13 and 14 are connected by “and,” they should</p>
<p>relate in some way. Some commentators</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>indicate that 1 Timothy 2:13</p>
<p>is a similar argument to 1 Corinthians 11:8–9 (and, I might add, 11:3). </p>
<p>However, the application in 1 Corinthians 11 does not aect church </p>
<p>leadership at all. Women can still pray and prophesy—only their attire </p>
<p>149. Spencer 1985: 23–29.</p>
<p>150. E.g., Mounce 2000: 130.</p>
<p>151. Mounce (2000: 135) notes that v. 14 “may be dicult to interpret.” He does </p>
<p>agree that “in some way, Adam and Eve are parallel to the Ephesian men and women.”</p>
<p>152. E.g., Mounce 1991: 130; Schreiner 2005: 106.</p>
