<p>True Widows and Younger Widows (5:3–16) 125</p>
<p>Some of the attributes of a real widow were also required of over-</p>
<p>seers (episkopos) and ministers (diakonos), being: not open to attack, an </p>
<p>elder, a one-man woman, bearing witness to good works, having brought </p>
<p>up children, shown hospitality, not loving money, not slanderers, and </p>
<p>having self-control.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>us, a real widow has become a church leadership</p>
<p>position, and, as such, was recognized by the later church, which recog-</p>
<p>nized women deaconesses, widows, virgins, and elders.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> McKenna sum-</p>
<p>marizes: “e Order of Widows was the ‘mother form’ of the organized </p>
<p>life of women in the service of the Church.”</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>e widows would devote themselves to prayer (5:5) of two types: </p>
<p>prayer for needs (dēesis) and prayer devoted to God (proseuchē). e </p>
<p>whole church is exhorted to include these types of prayers for everyone.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To be able to pray constantly, one would need to have the gi (charisma) </p>
<p>of “faith,” a faith exhibited in prayer.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> In contrast to hoping on and pray-</p>
<p>ing to God is living luxuriously</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>(5:6), which proleptically has already</p>
<p>resulted in not eternal life</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> but eternal death.</p>
<p>And these things command, that they may be not open to attack. </p>
<p>But if any do not provide for their own and especially members of the </p>
<p>household, (s)he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbelieving </p>
<p>person (5:7–8). Timothy is to insist on the family’s care of the widow </p>
<p>11. See 1 Tim 3:2. e overseer attributes that are missing are: being sober, wise, </p>
<p>well-behaved, apt in teaching, not given to getting drunk, not pugnacious, gentle, not </p>
<p>contentious, and not newly converted.</p>
<p>12. See 1 Tim 5:9. e positions of “virgin” and “monk” appear in the later church </p>
<p>(Council of Chalcedon [A.D. 451], Canon 16); Ign., Smyrn. 13:1 “the virgins who are </p>
<p>called widows” (Pol. Phil. 4.3). In Const. ap. (third to fourth century Syria) virgins, </p>
<p>widows, and elders sat before the other women (2. 57). See also Belleville 2009: 96.</p>
<p>13. McKenna 1967: 35.</p>
<p>14. See 1 Tim 2:1. e Jewish community had a precedence in Anna the prophet-</p>
<p>ess, a widow and an elder, who may have resided in the sector of the temple of Jerusa-</p>
<p>lem where she “fasted and prayed (dēesis), worshiping night and day” (Luke 2:36–37). </p>
<p>Aer seeing the child Jesus, she proclaimed Jesus as the Messiah to all who came (v. </p>
<p>38).</p>
<p>15. 1 Cor 12:9; Matt 21:21–22; Mark 11:22–24. See Spencer &amp; Spencer 1990b: </p>
<p>92–94. e emphasis on prayer continued in the later church. Polycarp describes wid-</p>
<p>ows as “God’s altar” who “pray unceasingly for everyone” (Phil. 4:3). Anna and Judith </p>
<p>were also used as examples for widows in Const. ap. 3.7; 8.25.</p>
<p>16. e same verb is used of the wealthy landowners (Jas 5:5). </p>
<p>17. 1 Tim 4:8; 6:19. See Titus 1:2.</p>
