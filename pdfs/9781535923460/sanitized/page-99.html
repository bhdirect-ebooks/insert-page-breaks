<p>Godly Overseeing (3:1–16) 83</p>
<p>remain married to two women, but not a woman to two men (m. Yebam. </p>
<p>10:1, 4). Jewish law also contains, according to Tal Ilan: “no denition </p>
<p>of or provision against adultery by the husband against his wife, since </p>
<p>he may marry more than one woman; the wife, on the other hand, must </p>
<p>remain strictly faithful to her husband. e only way a man can commit </p>
<p>adultery is with another’s man’s wife.”</p>
<p>218</p>
Paul’s directive would also eliminate some cases of divorce.
<p>219</p>
<p> In ef-</p>
<p>fect, a one-woman man (3:2) would be a man who is “joined fast to his </p>
<p>wife” and “one esh” with her.</p>
<p>220</p>
<p>us, the emphasis in the text is not on</p>
<p>overseers being men, with one wife, but on the type of man who should </p>
<p>be in leadership. A single chaste man (or woman) would not contradict </p>
<p>Paul’s prescription. Such a man yet has no wife to whom to be faithful. If </p>
<p>single men could not be overseers, then Paul, maybe even Timothy, could </p>
<p>not be overseers. Even Jesus, the greatest “Overseer” of our lives (1 Pet </p>
<p>2:25), could not be an overseer! However, the advantage of a single per-</p>
<p>son is that he or she could focus on the Lord’s aairs, as opposed to the </p>
<p>married person, who is concerned to please the spouse (1 Cor 7:32–34).</p>
<p>An additional question to consider is the nature of language that </p>
<p>may appear sex specic but is in reality generic. If 1 Timothy 3:2 and </p>
<p>Titus 1:6 are sex specic, how, then, will we interpret Malachi 2:15, “let </p>
<p>none be faithless to the wife of his youth” (RSV)? Does that mean that </p>
<p>Malachi allows wives to be faithless to their husbands? I think not.</p>
<p>Some of the masculine pronouns in English translations are neces-</p>
<p>sary because of the nature of the English language requiring a pronoun </p>
<p>for the third person singular or a shorter sentence, but they do not neces-</p>
<p>sarily render any sex specic pronouns in the literal Greek, as we see in </p>
<p>the following chart:</p>
<p>218. Ilan 1995: 135. Belleville agrees “that marital faithfulness was a greater chal-</p>
<p>lenge for the husband in that society” (2009: 68).</p>
<p>219. Matt 19:12. Paul is not against remarriage of a widow(er): 1 Tim 5:14; Rom </p>
<p>7:1–3; 1 Cor 7:8–9, 39; Towner 2006: 251.</p>
<p>220. Matt 19:5–6; Gen 2:24. For a discussion of the meaning of “one esh,” see </p>
<p>Spencer 2009: 25–31.</p>
