<p>Pursue Righteousness (6:11–16) 155</p>
<p>• Some ... missed the mark (1 Tim 6:21, astocheō)</p>
<p>• Join in suering as a good soldier (2 Tim 2:3–5, stratiōēs)<span class="ff2"> <span class="_ _1" /><span class="ff4 ws172">of Christ </span></span></p>
<p>Jesus. No one serving as a soldier (strateuō) entwines himself in </p>
<p>aairs of life, in order that, by the one having enlisted him, he </p>
<p>will accommodate himself. But if also someone may compete in a </p>
<p>contest, (s)he is not crowned unless (s)he might compete accord-</p>
<p>ing to the rules (lawfully).</p>
<p>• e good ght—(2 Tim 4:7, agōn) I fought for myself (agoni<span class="_ _3" />-</p>
<p>zomai), the race course—I nished</p>
<p>• Crown (2 Tim 4:8, stephanos) of righteousness</p>
<p>As he does in 4:7–8, Paul reinterprets the appealing imagery of ath-</p>
<p>letics for the Christian life, the good ght of the faith (6:12). Whatever </p>
<p>was being taught at Ephesus must have been quite enticing for even Tim-</p>
<p>othy as a Christian leader to be warned and exhorted numerous times.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul had already described many ways for Timothy (and the church) </p>
<p>spiritually to “exercise.”</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>Jesus too had used the same verb (agōnizomai)</p>
<p>to describe the eort needed to enter the narrow door (Luke 13:24). </p>
<p>Grasp or “lay hold of, seize”</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>(epilambanō, 6:12) continues the</p>
<p>athletic imagery. Fight and grasp use the middle voice to highlight the </p>
<p>eort Timothy needs to take. Salvation is granted by the Savior (4:10), but </p>
<p>simultaneously the thankful believer must cooperate with that grace. e </p>
<p>believer should put as much eort as Jesus did when he seized drowning </p>
<p>Peter out of the Sea of Galilee (Matt 14:31). </p>
<p>Eternal life</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>comes from an eternal God (1:17; 6:16). e only</p>
<p>way to have eternal life is to be acceptable to the eternal God. Jesus de-</p>
<p>nes eternal life as knowing God, the only true God, and Jesus Christ </p>
<p>whom God sent (John 17:3). Jesus came to give life and that abundantly </p>
<p>(John 10:10). us, eternal life or “heaven” can be experienced now with </p>
<p>personal knowledge of God that aects one’s mind, heart, and actions. </p>
<p>Eternal life is grasped now as a preview, but fully received in the future.</p>
<p>Timothy had been called (by God) to have eternal life, but also he </p>
<p>confessed his faith before witnesses (6:12). Being called into fellowship </p>

<p>79. 1 Tim 1:5, 18–19; 2:1; 4:3–7, 12–16; 5:1–2, 19–23; 6:6, 8, 11.</p>

<p>81. Aiōnios gives “prominence to immeasurableness of eternity” (LSJ, 26; ayer, </p>
<p>21). See Titus 1:2.</p>
