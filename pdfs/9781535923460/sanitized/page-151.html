<p>Fusing the Horizons: Applying the Order of Widows to Today 135</p>
<p>prayer be encouraged? (2) should they be paid? (3) should believers, women </p>
<p>or men of any age, who dedicate themselves to prayer be paid? </p>
<p>Some traditional Korean churches invest in an apartment for widows </p>
<p>who pray as a ministry and also oversee the upkeep of the entire church </p>
<p>building. Originally, these widows were also the intermediaries between mis-</p>
<p>sionaries and the women.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Today, in various African countries which are plagued by the devasta-</p>
<p>tion of men by the AIDS virus, widows are sometimes thrown out onto the </p>
<p>streets, reduced to begging or, worse, prostitution. In response, some gov-</p>
<p>ernments are pressuring Christian men to take on more wives to rescue such </p>
<p>women, since Christian husbands are honest and moral and will provide for </p>
<p>them. This ofﬁcial solution creates a great dilemma for Christian men. They </p>
<p>want to obey the government and rescue these women, but both they and </p>
<p>their churches oppose polygamy. In many countries, polygamous men are </p>
<p>welcome to join Christian churches, but they may not hold ofﬁce.</p>
<p>To this dilemma, reinstituting the order of widows speaks powerfully </p>
<p>as a moral and viable solution. Together the entire church can provide for </p>
<p>widows who may now serve the church as intercessors and ministers in their </p>
<p>own right.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>We are reminded that God can use believers no matter their</p>
<p>age to advance God’s kingdom. The church can take care of some physical </p>
<p>needs while promoting prayer. If the prayer is a multidimensional one (for </p>
<p>needs, worship, intercession, and thanksgiving) done in community, it can </p>
<p>serve as a necessary aid to other ministry strategies. </p>
<p>Elders Leading Well (5:17–25)</p>
<p>Paul now moves on to a broader category of leadership (elders), but he still </p>
<p>handles the issue of recompense: e elders leading well—consider wor-</p>
<p>thy of double honor, especially the ones laboring in teaching the word, </p>
<p>for the Scripture says: “Do not muzzle a threshing ox” and “Worthy is </p>
<p>the worker of his wages” (5:17–18). So far Paul has dealt with three clear </p>
<p>leadership groups: overseers (3:2), ministers (3:8, 11), and widows (5:3). </p>

<p>their mission.</p>
