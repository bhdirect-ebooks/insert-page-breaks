<p>1 Timothy 2–350</p>
<p>who requires purity from humans and the One who can accomplish that </p>
<p>purity are the same. Later in 1 Timothy, monogamous marriage or a one-</p>
<p>esh union will reect humans being created in the image of one God.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>e pagan Gentiles might nd several oensive aspects in Paul’s </p>
<p>statement. First, many would believe in a variety of gods for a variety of </p>
<p>purposes and people. As Artemidorus explained, “What the gods signify </p>
<p>for men, goddesses signify for women. Gods are more auspicious for men </p>
<p>than goddesses; goddesses are more auspicious for women than gods” </p>
<p>(Onir. 4.75). At Ephesus, many would place gods in a hierarchy with </p>
<p>Artemis at the top. e temple of Artemis at Ephesus (Artemision) was </p>
<p>also renowned as an asylum for the innocent yet simultaneously Artemis </p>
<p>could be a slaughterer.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>Some would think she should be the mediator</p>
<p>(2:5). Others would conclude she would not save all (v. 4). In addition, </p>
<p>Ephesus had shrines sacred to Zeus, Cybele and Demeter (mother of the </p>
<p>gods), Apollo (Artemis’ brother), Asclepius (god of healing), Aphrodite, </p>
<p>Dionysus, Hygeia, Pan, Isis, Hecate, Marnas (river god), Leto (Artemis’ </p>
<p>mother), Athena, Serapis, Eros, and deied emperors, such as Augus-</p>
<p>tus.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>Paul, in contrast, asserts that there is only one God who can serve</p>
<p>all needs, including salvation, for all people.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>e pivotal teaching in Deuteronomy 6:4 also contains within itself </p>
<p>the allusion to plurality within the one God. One can refer, for example, </p>
<p>to two people united in marriage (Gen 2:24) or to all humans when they </p>
<p>have one language (Gen 11:1, 6). Elohim is an abstract plural word for </p>
<p>God, but it has a singular verb when referring to the unique living God </p>
<p>(e.g., Gen 1:26–28). e Lord has one “name” but three persons (“the </p>
<p>Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit”).</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>us, aer God’s revelation</p>
<p>to Paul</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>and his own reection, he can assert that God is one but yet that</p>
<p>one God has three persons.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>Christ Jesus is the only mediator between God and humans. Paul </p>
<p>places in juxtaposition the term human (anthrōpos): humans, human </p>

for Zeus, mother goddesses, Mēn, and champions of divine justice and vengeance.
