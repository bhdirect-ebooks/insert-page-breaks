<p>Not to Teach Dierent Doctrine, but Rather Love (1:3–7) 27</p>
<p>Conscience (syneidēsis, 1:5) is an important concept for Paul and </p>
<p>for the church at Ephesus. Paul describes himself as having a “good” or </p>
<p>“clear” conscience before God, humans, the Sanhedrin (Acts 23:1), gov-</p>
<p>ernor Felix (Acts 24:16), and the church.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>If the heart symbolizes the</p>
<p>inward person, the conscience is one aspect of the inward person, the </p>
<p>mind’s “moral personality.”</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>Philo describes the conscience as an internal</p>
<p>witness linked with God which convicts the sinner of his guilt, condemns </p>
<p>him, holds him back, and directs his conduct. Conscience is “a knowing </p>
<p>that the subject shares (syn-eidenai) either with himself or with someone </p>
<p>e l s e.”</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>According to Ceslas Spicq, no other ancient writer approaches St.</p>
<p>Paul’s use of syneidēsis in “density and precision: Paul made syneidēsis </p>
<p>into the interior faculty for the personal discernment of good and evil, </p>
<p>the practical rule of conduct and motive for action.”</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>A conscience can</p>
<p>be deled</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>or damaged (4:2). Lack of a good conscience and sincere faith</p>
<p>can destroy a Christian’s life (1:19). A pure conscience is necessary for </p>
<p>Christian leadership (3:9). Love that arises out of a confused sense of </p>
<p>right and wrong will be ineective.</p>
<p>How can love arise out of faith (1:5)? Both love and faith may be </p>
<p>found in Christ and now are reected in Christ’s followers. Love is a re-</p>
<p>ection of one’s faith in Christ. People who do not love their family mem-</p>
<p>bers have denied their faith (5:8). ose who love money wander away </p>
<p>from the faith (6:10). Christians should have a faith that is genuine (1:5). </p>
<p>Hypokrinomai can refer to playing a part on the stage or pretending.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> </p>
<p>us, Paul does not want a faith that is simply an act or “hypocritical.”</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e importance of a genuine love has been reiterated from a variety of </p>
<p>synonymous terms: heart, conscience, and now genuine.</p>
<p>Some people at Ephesus have deviated from (astocheō) the goal: love </p>
<p>from a clean heart and a good conscience and a genuine faith (1:5–6). </p>
<p>As a result, they twist out (ektrepō) away from the truth to talk devoid </p>
<p>of truth (1:6).</p>
