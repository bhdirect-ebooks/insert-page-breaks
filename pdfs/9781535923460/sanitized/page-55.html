<p>e Apostle Paul, Once Unrighteous, ReceivedMercy(1:12–17) 39</p>
is an individual who was a sinner (a synecdoche).
<p>120</p>
<p>He was saved from</p>
<p>punishment by Christ Jesus, who showed compassion (makrothymia) </p>
<p>toward Paul by being merciful toward him, forgiving him (1:16). e </p>
<p>word family makrothymia/makrothymeō</p>
<p>121</p>
<p> literally signies the hold-</p>
<p>ing of strong feelings over a long time, but it can refer to endurance (Jas </p>
<p>5:1–11) and compassion. One of God’s central self-revelations was made </p>
<p>to Moses at Mount Sinai: “e Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gra-</p>
<p>cious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness” </p>
<p>(Exod 34:6 NRSV). Makrothymeō is a synonym for merciful, gracious, </p>
<p>and abounding in steadfast love. God holds on to strong feeling over a </p>
<p>long time, being compassionate, which results in mercy. Makrothymeō/</p>
<p>ia is used in this sense of compassion as a synonym for mercy several </p>
<p>times in Hebrew literature. According to Proverbs 19:11, “a merciful man </p>
<p>is compassionate” (LXX). Jesus the son of Sirach says, in comparison to </p>
<p>eternity, a human life is like “one drop from the ocean or a single grain of </p>
<p>sand. at is why the Lord is patient with people; that is why he lavishes </p>
<p>his mercy upon them” (Ecclus 18:10–11 REB). Jesus the son of Sirach’s </p>
<p>analogy is similar to Peter’s which says that “one day for the Lord is as </p>
<p>a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. e Lord is not slow </p>
<p>about his promise, as some count slowness, but is compassionate toward </p>
<p>you, not wanting any to die, but all to reach repentance” (2 Pet 3:8–9). </p>
<p>Paul calls makrothymeō/ia a characteristic of love (1 Cor 13:4), and a fruit </p>
<p>of the Spirit (Gal 5:22–23).</p>

<p> </p>
<p>e root typos (“type, archetype, pattern, model to be initiated”) </p>
<p>is used elsewhere by Paul to describe Paul and his coworkers.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>For the</p>
<p>Philippians, Paul and Timothy are models of believers who persevere de-</p>
<p>spite suering,</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>and, for the essalonians, Paul, Silas, and Timothy are</p>
<p>models of believers who work and are not idle.</p>

<p>120. A part representing a whole. See Spencer 1998b: 209.</p>
<p>121. Makros, “lasting long” and thymos, “feeling and thought, esp. of strong feeling </p>
<p>and passion (LSJ, 810).</p>
<p>122. If makrothymeō is translated as compassionate, it claries several of Jesus’ </p>
<p>parables. e laborer who had never paid the een years worth of salary he owed to </p>
<p>the king asked him to be compassionate and he would pay him everything. By granting </p>
<p>more time, the king would be merciful (Matt 18:26, 29), but the king forgave the whole </p>
<p>debt. In Luke 18:1–8, God will show compassion to the elect by procuring the justice </p>
<p>for which they ask. See Spencer 1990b: 60–61.</p>
