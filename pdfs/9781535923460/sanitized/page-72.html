<p>1 Timothy 2–356</p>
<p>is used to describe positive character traits of overseers (1 Tim 3:2) and </p>
<p>slaves,</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>thus, it is not a sex-specic term. e verb kosmeō can refer to</p>
<p>organizing, decorating, making attractive, or preparing for use a house, </p>
<p>grave site, temple, or lamp.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>us, he uses a phrase with a wordplay:</p>
<p>katastolē kosmiōs can be understood as “attractive clothing” or well be-</p>
<p>haved deportment. e women’s intention is to have attractive clothing, </p>
<p>instead Paul wants them to have well behaved deportment. How, then, </p>
<p>can people be genuinely “attractive”? If they have the dual traits of re-</p>
<p>spect for others (aidōs) and wisdom (sōphrosynē) (2:9). </p>
<p>Aidōs (2:9) is a frequent virtue for Greek philosophers,</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>but rare</p>
<p>in the Bible. It refers to “reverence, awe, respect for the feeling or opin-</p>
<p>ion of others or for one’s own conscience, and so shame, self-respect.”</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ceslas Spicq summarizes: “It is then a restraint, a dignity, a modesty, or </p>
<p>a discretion that keeps one from excess; thus a self-respect and a sense </p>
<p>of honor that is oen identied with modesty” or “the religious fear that </p>
<p>one experiences in the presence of the sacred.”</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>It can refer to women</p>
<p>or men (3 Macc 1:19; 4:5). In the context of 1 Timothy 2, its opposite is </p>
<p>gold-braided hair or pearls or expensive apparel (2:9). us, Paul wants </p>
<p>the women in worship to dress themselves in a way that does not shame </p>
<p>others. eir honor or attractiveness is in their character and actions.</p>
<p>Sōphrosynē (wisely) and aidōs (respect, 2:9) both relate to restraint</p>
<p>of oneself (as does hēsychia in 2:11).</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>Sōphrosynē (wisely) comes from</p>
<p>the root sōphrōn (“wisdom”).</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>Paul repeats this same virtue in 2:15 and</p>
<p>uses it in self-description (Acts 26:25). Although the ancients might have </p>
<p>used it as a virtue for women,</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>in the New Testament sōphrosynē and</p>
<p>its word-family are used as a positive trait for women and men. Respect </p>

<p>74. Other Bible interpreters have used to adorn (kosmeō) as the main innitive </p>
<p>of the sentence, moving it to the beginning of 2:9, while still assuming I want the is </p>
<p>an ellipsis, but then they miss the full parallelism of 2:9 with 2:8, e.g., Towner 2006: </p>
<p>204–5; Mounce 2000: 108–9; Robertson 1931, 4:569; Ellicott 1861: 50; Bernard 1922: </p>

<p>75. See Titus 2:2.</p>
<p>76. Mitchell 1993, 1:189. Pomeroy 1984 writes sōphrosynē is mentioned “more </p>
<p>frequently than any other quality on women’s tombstones” (70).</p>
