<p>Pursue Righteousness (6:11–16) 159</p>
<p>to describe God’s sovereignty (dynastēs, basileus, and kyrios, 6:15). All </p>
<p>these terms may be used of God and of humans.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>e human sovereigns</p>
<p>are those for whom the church and Timothy should pray (2:2). Dynastēs </p>
<p>emphasizes God as being able or powerful.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>Basileus emphasizes God</p>
<p>as reigning, the ruler.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>Kyrios (lord) emphasizes God as “he to whom</p>
<p>a person or thing belongs, about which he has the power of deciding,” the </p>
<p>“owner,” God as having “dominion over.”</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy, the stronger term</p>
<p>despotēs is used of only humans: slave masters (6:1–2) and women ruling </p>
<p>their households (oikodespoteō, 5:14). Trench suggests that generally a </p>
<p>despotēs “exercises a more unrestricted power and absolute domination” </p>
<p>than the kyrios, who has authority “owning limitations—moral limita-</p>
<p>tions it may be.”</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>Paul sets in perspective the confession Timothy has</p>
<p>made and will need to continue to make.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p> If ever he is intimated, Timo-</p>
<p>thy should remember that the ultimate source of his life, God the Trinity, </p>
<p>has power, reign, and ownership over all human rulers. Lord (kyrios) in </p>
<p>1 Timothy is used only of Jesus Christ, the One who strengthens and </p>
<p>appoints (1:12), the One whose grace produces faith and love (1:14), the </p>
<p>One their message is centered around (6:3), who will return again reveal-</p>
<p>ing the full nature of God’s kingship (6:15). Kyrios is also used of God in </p>
<p>the Old Testament (e.g., Gen 2:4), the “Lord of lords” (Deut 10:17), and </p>
<p>in the New Testament of Jesus as God incarnate (John 20:28).</p>
<p>e only one having immortality, dwelling in unapproachable </p>
<p>light, whom no one among humans saw, neither is able to see, to whom </p>
<p>be honor and power forever, amen appears to refer to God the Father but </p>
<p>also describes Jesus the Son. Athanasia (immortality, 6:16) is a synon<span class="_ _1" />ym </p>
<p>of aphthartos (“imperishable,” 1:17). While aphthartos signies not liable </p>
<p>to decay, athanasia signies not liable to death (thanatos).</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>Humans, at</p>
<p>98. E.g., about humans dynastēs: Luke 1:52; Acts 8:27; basileus: 1 Tim 2:2; kyrios: </p>
<p>Eph 6:5.</p>
<p>99. E.g., Rom 14:4; 2 Cor 9:8; 13:3; ayer, 160.</p>
<p>100. See 1 Tim 1:17; ayer, 98.</p>
<p>101. ayer, 365.</p>
<p>102. Trench 1880: 96.</p>
<p>103. 1 Tim 6:12, 14; 2 Tim 1:8.</p>
<p>104. See 1 Tim 1:17. Paul uses the two terms synonymously in 1 Cor 15:53–54: </p>
<p>“For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable (aphtharsia), and the </p>
<p>mortal with immortality (athanasia). When the perishable has been clothed with the </p>
<p>imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will </p>
<p>come true: ‘Death has been swallowed up in victory.’”</p>
