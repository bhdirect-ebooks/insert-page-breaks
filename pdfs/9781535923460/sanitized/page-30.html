<p>Introduction to 1 and 2 Timothy 14</p>
<p>But where the Holy Spirit was present, so were evil spirits. ese evil </p>
<p>spirits were cast out by Paul, but they attacked the seven sons of the high </p>
<p>priest Sceva (Acts 19:13–16). Seeking to defend the goddess Artemis, </p>
<p>mobs attacked the Christians (Acts 19:23–41). e Holy Spirit opened a </p>
<p>door despite many Gentile and Jewish adversaries.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many Jews were brought to Ephesus under Antiochus II and given </p>
<p>citizenship.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>ey insisted on not worshiping the Gentile gods, being free</p>
<p>to celebrate the Sabbath (not appearing in court), not being forced to par-</p>
<p>ticipate in military service, and being able to send money to the temple </p>
<p>in Jerusalem.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>According to Strabo, Ephesus was “the largest emporium in Asia </p>
<p>this side the Taurus.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Many inscriptions called Ephesus “the rst and</p>
<p>greatest metropolis of Asia.”</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>e city had around 200,000–250,000</p>
<p>inhabitants.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>It was the seaway to Rome and gateway to Asia with its</p>
<p>harbor and was connected to a major highway used by all who traveled </p>
<p>towards the east.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Androclus, son of Codrus, King of Athens, who led</p>
<p>an Ionian colonization to Ephesus, became its ocial founder, although </p>
<p>ancients recognized others (Carians) were there earlier,</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>as, for example,</p>
<p>Smyrna, an Amazon who took possession of Ephesus. Amazons are given </p>
<p>credit for naming the city.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> Lysimachus founded the later city of Ephe-</p>
<p>sus.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>When King Attalus Philometor died (133 B.C.), he le the Romans</p>
<p>as his heirs, and they proclaimed the country a province, calling it Asia, </p>
<p>the same name as the continent.</p>
