<p>1 Timothy 4:1—5:2104</p>
<p>Lydia, in contrast, in Philippi listened attentively and receptively, through </p>
<p>God’s help, to Paul’s teachings (Acts 16:14). Timothy too will be exhorted </p>
<p>to be attentive to good teaching (1 Tim 4:13). However, in Ephesus, some </p>
<p>were listening carefully and receptively to deceitful spirits and demonic </p>
<p>teachings. Later, Paul will clarify that “evil people” are the intermediaries </p>
<p>between the spirits and the departing believers (2 Tim 3:13).</p>
<p>Evil spirits are mentioned numerous times in the gospels.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>Twelve and Seventy-two were empowered by Jesus to cast them out.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul himself cast out evil spirits at Ephesus (Acts 19:12, 15). Ephesus was </p>
<p>known as a center for magic.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Even though some people might attempt</p>
<p>to use magic to ward o evil spirits,</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>humans will always have a residue</p>
<p>of evil.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>ese demons falsied the teachings (didaskalia) at Ephesus,</p>
<p>which explains why true teachings are so important.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Six aspects of those who depart are described by Paul: they will de-</p>
<p>part: (1) in the later times; (2) by paying attention to deceitful spirits and </p>
<p>demonic teachings; (3) by means of false words; (4) by searing their own </p>
<p>consciences; (5) by promoting the forbidding of marriage, and (6) by </p>
<p>abstaining from certain foods (4:1–3). ose who promote the demonic </p>
<p>teachings do so with false words: “ey are esp. dangerous because they </p>
<p>play a role (en hypokrisei) that puts their victims o the scent; like ac-</p>
<p>tors who play parts so well that their words have the ring of truth.”</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>hypokrisis (hypocrite) in ancient times was an actor on the stage.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Like</p>
<p>Satan, who disguises himself as an angel of light (2 Cor 11:14), so too </p>
<p>these false teachers have learned to disguise themselves by their eective </p>
<p>acting.</p>
<p>Having a good conscience (4:2) is an important goal for Paul in 1 </p>
<p>Timothy.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> If the conscience is the interior faculty for the personal dis-</p>
<p>cernment of good and evil, here that faculty has been damaged by being </p>
<p>branded or seared with a hot iron. Kaustēriazō includes the root ideas of </p>
