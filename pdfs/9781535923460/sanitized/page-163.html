<p>Excursus: Heresy in 1 Timothy</p>
<p>In summary, what kind of heresy was there at Ephesus as described in 1 </p>
<p>Timothy?</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>We can inductively draw out some of its features by assessing</p>
<p>Paul’s answers and emphases in the letter. Christology normally affects so-</p>
<p>teriology. The heterodox male and female teachers had inadequate teaching </p>
<p>about Jesus Christ (6:3). Most likely they did not agree that Christ Jesus, </p>
<p>a human, was the one mediator between God and humans sufﬁcient for all </p>
<p>people (2:5–6). Therefore, all humans could not be fully saved by God’s </p>
<p>mercy. Thus, God as the Savior was emphasized in many places in Paul’s </p>
<p>letter,</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>as well as the desire to present a positive inﬂuence to the larger</p>
<p>community by godly behavior.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>The teaching focused in two contrasting</p>
<p>areas: legalism with asceticism and promotion of wealth. When Christ is </p>
<p>seen as insufﬁcient to save, people create laws to make up for Christ’s </p>
<p>insufﬁciency. The legalistic or “unlawful” use of the law included using </p>
<p>the law for the salvation of the righteous, not the unrighteous (1:8–11) and </p>
<p>forbidding marriage and certain foods (4:3). The promotion of this legalism </p>
<p>was done by argumentation and verbal battles about myths and genealogies </p>
<p>(1:4, 6; 6:4–5). The men even argued during prayer (2:8). The demonic </p>
<p>and magic were included (4:1; 5:13). Truth was abandoned for slander.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>This legalism was concurrent with a desire for wealth and luxury. </p>
<p>Instead of living for their Savior, they lived for themselves. The women </p>
<p>ﬂaunted their wealth even during prayer (2:9). The young widows were liv-</p>
<p>ing in luxury while families were not supporting the older widows (5:6, 8). </p>
<p>Those who deserved to be paid were not (5:17–18). Godly behavior was </p>
<p>not the result (4:7). Possibly, the “hypocritical liars” (4:2) were leaders </p>
<p>who taught ascetism while they themselves lived in luxury. Or, they lived an </p>
<p>ascetic lifestyle for ﬁnancial beneﬁt.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Some wanted to become wealthy at</p>
<p>the expense of others.</p>
<p>20. See Titus 1:10–14.</p>
<p>21. 1:13–16; 2:3–4, 15; 4:10, 16.</p>
<p>22. 6:3; 3:2–3, 7, 10; 5:7, 14.</p>
<p>23. 6:5; 1:19; 3:6, 11.</p>
<p>24. Kelly (1963: 135) thinks they exacted fees for their instruction; Marshall 1999: </p>
<p>643.</p>
