<p>Heterodoxy Was Predicted by the Spirit (4:1–5) 103</p>
<p>Antioch, and the prophet Agabus.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy 4:1, the Holy Spirit is</p>
<p>speaking explicitly about later times.</p>
<p>Have the later times (4:1) already begun, or are they future times? </p>
<p>Normally, later (hysteros) by itself refers to some event that follows pre-</p>
<p>vious events (e.g., Luke 20:32). In 1 Timothy 4:1, Paul probably refers </p>
<p>to “later times” aer Jesus’ “own times” (2:6) in contrast to the future </p>
<p>time when Jesus would return (6:14–15). A synonymous term is used </p>
<p>in 2 Timothy (“last days,” eschatē, hēmera, 3:1), which, as in 1 Timothy </p>
<p>4:1–3, refers to activities which appear quite contemporary, such as “lov-</p>
<p>ers of themselves, lovers of money ...” ) (2 Tim 3:2). e “last day” in </p>
<p>the singular normally refers to the very nal day, the judgment day when </p>
<p>Jesus returns.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>e “last days” in the plural may refer to the days that</p>
<p>began at Pentecost, fullling Joel’s prophecy (Acts 2:17) or the days aer </p>
<p>Old Testament times that began with Jesus’ incarnation and life.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Either</p>
<p>way, these “last days” have already begun and are present. Calvin points </p>
<p>out that “to us in the present day” the warning is “not less useful, when we </p>
<p>perceive that nothing has happened which was not foretold by an express </p>
<p>prophecy of the Spirit.”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>How sad it is to learn that some will depart for themselves from the </p>
<p>faith (4:1). Although they themselves are responsible for their actions,</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p>others are also responsible, the ones who do the deceiving.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>ese are evil</p>
<p>spirits, not humans, who ultimately are responsible for causing humans to </p>
<p>wander away from the truth.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Eve is the archetypal human who wandered</p>
<p>away from the truth because she was deceived.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Eve’s weakness was that</p>
<p>she listened carefully (pay attention, prosechō) to the wrong source: the </p>
<p>devil disguised as a serpent.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>In a similar way, the crowds in Samaria had</p>
<p>listened with a receptive attitude to the magician Simon (Acts 8:10–11). </p>
<p>4. Acts 10:19; 11:12, 28; 13:2, 4; 19:6; 21:11.</p>
<p>5. John 6:39–40, 44, 54; 11:24; 12:48.</p>
<p>6. Heb 1:2; 1 Pet 1:19–20; 2 Pet 3:2–3; Jude 17–18.</p>
<p>7. Calvin, 2190.</p>
<p>8. Implication of middle voice (Robertson 1934: 809, 873). On “faith” see 1 Tim </p>
<p>1:19. Paul uses the future middle to indicate the predictive nature of the Spirit’s mes-</p>
<p>sage. Not all will depart but some. </p>
<p>9. See Titus 3:3; 1 Tim 3:16.</p>
<p>10. e opposite of deception is truth: Eph 4:14–15; 2 Pet 2:18; 3:17; 1 John 4:6. </p>
<p>Jesus also predicted the future deception of believers (e.g., Matt 24:4–25).</p>
<p>11. See 1 Tim 2:14.</p>
<p>12. Gen 3:1–6; 2 Cor 11:3; Rev 12:9. See Titus 2:3.</p>
