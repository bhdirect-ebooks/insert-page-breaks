<p>Introduction to Pastoral Letters 7</p>
<p>Timothy, Paul uses 31 unique words, less than in Philippians 1–4. Most </p>
<p>of the unique words are in 1 Timothy chapters 5–6, but, in chapter 5, Paul </p>
<p>has a unique topic—widows.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e argument about missing words is very subjective. “Savior” oc-</p>
<p>curs also in Philippians 3:20 (“Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ”) and Ephe-</p>
<p>sians 5:23. Paul’s use of eusebeia occurs only in the Pastoral letters. But, </p>
<p>Peter also uses it.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Could that word have become important at this time</p>
<p>in the church’s life to describe the need of the church? Or could it be a </p>
<p>key to Paul’s message at this time? Or, could it be a word brought to Paul’s </p>
<p>consciousness by Peter and others? Hillard explains that dierences can </p>
<p>come from “(a) lapse of time, the author’s age and new experiences; (b) </p>
<p>dierent circumstances, purposes and needs; and even (c) the author’s </p>
<p>own reading, study and thought—since no active mind, and least of all </p>
<p>men’s St. Paul’s, could stand still.”</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Some of the words that do not occur also only occur in a few of </p>
<p>Paul’s letters. ey are arbitrarily “important” words. For example, “spiri-</p>
<p>tual” (pneumatikos) does not occur in 2 Corinthians, Philippians, or Phi-</p>
<p>lemon and “boast” (kauchaomai, kauchēsis) does not occur in Colossians, </p>
<p>2 essalonians, and Philemon. Hanson says the “prose is pedestrian.” </p>
<p>It has no “depth,” but if any commentator sees depth of meaning, he re-</p>
<p>jects it. For example, about 1 Timothy 6:7, C. K. Barrett writes “e nal </p>
<p>nakedness of death demonstrates and underlines the initial nakedness </p>
<p>of birth.” To which Hanson replies: “But this seems over-subtle for the </p>
<p>author’s mentality.”</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Yet, the Pastorals have numerous poetical sections,</p>
<p>such as great indeed is “the mystery of our religion: He was manifested </p>
<p>in the esh, vindicated in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the </p>
<p>nations, believed on in the world, taken up into glory” (1 Tim 3:16 RSV). </p>
<p>Is 1 Timothy like the Didache and like Polycarp’s letter?</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> e Di-</p>
<p>dache is as much like 1 Corinthians as it is like 1 Timothy. e Didache </p>
<p>20. Paul also used several of these “unique” words in other forms in other letters </p>
<p>(leaving only 53 unique words in 1 Tim). </p>
<p>21. 2 Pet 1:3, 6, 7; 3:11; Acts 3:12.</p>
<p>22. Hillard 1919: xxxii. See Mounce’s (2000: civ-cx) lists of words that relate to </p>
<p>Paul’s new historical situation. Paul adapts his style as he communicates with dierent </p>
<p>congregations. See Spencer 1998b: 148, app. 1.</p>
<p>23. Barrett 1963: 84; Hanson 1982: 107. Yet Quinn &amp; Wacker (2000: 6) point out </p>
<p>the Pastorals have “alliteration, assonance, rhyme, paronomasia, polysyndeton . . . </p>
<p>asyndeton.”</p>
<p>24. E.g., Dibelius and Conzelmann 1972: 2, 6–7.</p>
