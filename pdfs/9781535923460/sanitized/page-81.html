<p>Godly Peaceful Lives (2:1–15) 65</p>
<p>Authenteō (2:12) as a verb of ruling takes the genitive case of the </p>
<p>person over whom the destructive domination is executed.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>In contrast,</p>
<p>didaskō (to teach) takes the accusative case for the person and topic </p>
<p>taught.</p>
<p>131</p>
<p>Consequently, grammatically man is most likely the object only</p>
<p>of authenteō.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>us, Paul is limiting women from teaching and from</p>
<p>having a destructive power (domineer) over men. Rather, they are to be </p>
<p>in “silence” (2:11–12). As a consequence, women at Ephesus will become </p>
<p>part of the health-producing educational process: learning peacefully, co-</p>
<p>operatively, not teaching yet, while not harming their teachers.</p>
<p>Why might Paul have chosen to use authenteō (domineer, 2:12) </p>
<p>when writing Ephesus? Artemis of Ephesus was modeled on the queen </p>
<p>bee.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>Aer the young queen has stung to death any other competing</p>
<p>queen bees, she leaves the hive on a mating ight. e seven or eight </p>
<p>drones who mate with her die because their reproductive organs are </p>
<p>torn out aer mating.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>Similarly, the cult of Artemis at Ephesus was</p>
<p>associated with ritual or actual murder. Catherine Kroeger explains: </p>
<p>“In Ephesus women also assumed the role of the man-slaying Amazons </p>
<p>who had founded the cult of Artemis of Ephesus .. . Evidence of ac-</p>
<p>tual human sacrice has been discovered at the lowest level of the great </p>
<p>Artemisium.”</p>
<p>135</p>
<p>Consequently, authenteō might very well allude to the</p>
<p>traditional destructive pagan feminine principle at Ephesus. If the wom-</p>
<p>en were actually killing men, Paul would have used a stronger verb than </p>
<p>I am not permitting. Rather, he was using authenteō metaphorically to </p>
<p>describe destructive attitudes of the women toward the men, modeling </p>
<p>themselves on Artemis, the “slaughterer,”</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>or, even on Eve, for, when she</p>
<p>ate the fruit forbidden by God, it resulted in death (Gen 3:3–4).</p>
<p>I. H. Marshall summarizes: “In the context it seems most likely that </p>
<p>through their being ‘deceived’ there was a false content to their teaching </p>
<p>130. BDAG, 150. e genitive case oen expresses possession, but it may serve as </p>
<p>the object.</p>
<p>131. BDAG, 241. e accusative case usually is the object of a transitive verb.</p>
<p>132. In contrast, when the object modies both verbs, Paul may place it in the rst </p>
<p>clause, e.g., 1 Tim 4:11; 6:2.</p>
