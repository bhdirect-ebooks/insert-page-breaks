<p>Excursus: Liing Up Hands 54</p>
<p>vice. It begins with reading of the Scriptures, then the president gives an </p>
<p>exposition, then all stand up and the president offers prayers followed by a </p>
<p>congregational “Amen.” The Eucharist is then taken (1 Apol. 65–67). The </p>
<p>prayers in 1 Timothy 2:8 appear not to be limited to the ruler of the syna-</p>
<p>gogue</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>or the president. Rather, there is a communal aspect to worship, as</p>
<p>in 1 Corinthians 14:26 (“whenever you gather, each has . . . ”).</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>e men at Ephesus were using this time allotted to prayer to dispute </p>
<p>with one another. Dialogismos (disputing) refers to the internal conver-</p>
<p>sation (e.g., Matt 15:19; Luke 5:21–22) that then can become external.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It can be motivated by desires to attack, challenge (Luke 5:21–22), pro-</p>
<p>mote oneself (Luke 9:46; 20:14), and produce feelings of fear or confusion </p>
<p>(Luke 24:38; Matt 16:7–8). </p>
<p>Orgē (anger) also refers to an internal impulse.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> God’s internal im-</p>
<p>pulse of “wrath” is always just, punishing evil, as Paul explains, “Beloved, </p>
<p>never avenge yourselves, but leave room for the wrath (“punishment”) </p>
<p>of God” (Rom 12:19 NRSV).</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>Rulers’ “wrath” should also serve just</p>
<p>punishment (Rom 13:4–5). But orgē among humans is more an internal </p>
<p>impulse harmful to others (Eph 4:31), as James warns: “Let everyone be </p>
<p>quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger for a man’s anger does not pro-</p>
<p>duce God’s righteousness” (1:19–20). us, the men at Ephesus were us-</p>
<p>ing the time of prayer to dispute with one another, impulsively allowing </p>
<p>their internal destructive thoughts to harm each other and not promote </p>
<p>the very activity they sought—attentive communication to God.</p>
<p>Josephus records a pertinent example where some men began quar-</p>
<p>relling during the prayer section of a synagogue service. e ruler of the </p>
<p>synagogue challenged Josephus for misusing funds. At the end of their </p>
<p>altercation, some men tried to kill Josephus, but, with the assembly in his </p>
<p>favor, Josephus escaped (Life 57–58 [294–303]). is illustration shows </p>
<p>how even if people appear to be involved in a pious activity like prayer it </p>
<p>can be misused to create ghting and not peace. </p>
<p>56. Male and female rulers of the synagogue have been found, e.g., Brooten 1982: </p>
<p>5–33.</p>
<p>57. Men and women prayed (and prophesied) in Corinth (1 Cor 11:4–5).</p>
<p>58. E.g., Luke 9:46–47; 20:14; Matt 16:7–8.</p>
<p>59. ayer, 452.</p>
