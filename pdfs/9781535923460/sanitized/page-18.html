<p>Introduction to Pastoral Letters2</p>
<p>Even though I have focused on the ow of argument, paragraphs and </p>
<p>sentences are constructed from words and phrases. erefore, in order to </p>
<p>study the thoughts, I have also paid attention to semantics and grammar. </p>
<p>I have done a close reading of the text. Like Luke, I have attempted to </p>
<p>do a thorough investigation, but one understandable to my readers. My </p>
<p>husband, as a theologian and a grammarian, graciously read the entire </p>
<p>commentary. I am a “scholar,” but also a believer with the simple faith </p>
<p>of a child (Luke 18:16–17). I do believe these words, although those of </p>
<p>the Apostle Paul, are also God-breathed, I have, therefore, not read these </p>
<p>letters as a skeptic, but as someone who is in love with God, who inspired </p>
<p>the words and thoughts, and in sympathy with Paul, as a friend and col-</p>
<p>league in ministry, who was mentoring other ministers in very dicult </p>
<p>situations.</p>
<p>Either Titus or 1 Timothy could have been written rst. However, </p>
<p>if Paul had just le Rome, he might have rst traveled to Crete before </p>
<p>moving on to Ephesus, Colossae, and Philippi.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>As I was writing the commentary, occasionally beautiful Christian </p>
<p>melodies and lyrics based on 1 Timothy would echo in my mind, such </p>
<p>as “Immortal, Invisible, God Only Wise” and “Now Unto the King Eter-</p>
<p>nal.” May my words also encourage you further to enjoy and trust God’s </p>
<p>awesome presence and words! God is our merciful, sovereign, impartial </p>
<p>Savior and Creator, and worthy of much study, as well as praise.</p>
<p>Authorship of Pastoral Letters</p>
<p>1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus begin: “Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus,” </p>
<p>or “Paul, a slave of God, but apostle of Jesus Christ.” Because of similarity </p>
<p>to the headings to Paul’s other letters, many commentators conclude that </p>
<p>Paul is the author of all the Pastorals.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Even commentators, such as C. K.</p>
<p>Barrett, who conclude that Paul is not the author, agree that the external </p>
<p>evidence supports Paul as author.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Commentators ask, could the type of person who wrote these letters </p>
<p>be the same Paul who wrote the other New Testament letters? Who is the </p>
