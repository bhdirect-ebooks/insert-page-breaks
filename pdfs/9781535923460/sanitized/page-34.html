<p>Artemis’ name, together with the</p>
<p>names of other gods, would be repeated in incantations.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> Some Chris-</p>
<p>tians at Ephesus had previously participated in magic practices. When </p>
<p>they willingly and publicly burned their valuable incantation books, the </p>
<p>gospel message grew and became powerful (Acts 19:18–20). Today only </p>
<p>a column of the temple remains.</p>

<p>Analytic Outline of 1 Timothy</p>
<p>Paul’s overall purpose is to urge Timothy to promote the sound doctrine </p>
<p>of God, Savior, who desires all to be saved and to come to knowledge </p>
<p>of the truth by countering the false teaching threatening the life of the </p>
<p>church at Ephesus.</p>
<p>I. Paul reminds Timothy to warn the false teachers at Ephesus not to teach </p>
<p>dierent doctrine (1:1–20).</p>
<p> A. Introduction: Paul writes Timothy, his child in faith (1:1–2).</p>
<p>B. Paul urges Timothy to encourage the Ephesians not to teach</p>
<p>dierent doctrine, but rather love from a clean heart and a good </p>
<p>conscience and genuine faith (1:3–7).</p>
<p>C. In contrast to what is being taught, the law is intended for the</p>
<p>unrighteous not the righteous (1:8–11).</p>
<p>D. Even the Apostle Paul was once unrighteous, but he received</p>
<p>mercy as an example to others (1:12–17). </p>
<p>E. Paul charges Timothy to keep the faith and a good conscience</p>
<p>(1:18–20).</p>
<p>II. In order that all may be saved and come to knowledge of the truth, Paul </p>
<p>promotes peaceable prayer, education, and leaders (2:1—3:16).</p>

<p>Letters functioned as charms to make the bearers invincible (Athenaeus, Deipn. </p>
