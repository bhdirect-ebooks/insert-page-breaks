<p>True Widows and Younger Widows (5:3–16) 133</p>
<p>many and ll the earth and subdue it” (Gen 1:28). Teknogoneō (5:14) is </p>
<p>the verb form of teknogonia (2:15). If salvation came through childbirth, </p>
<p>then bearing children is a worthwhile activity. Paul is not requiring all </p>
<p>women to get married and to bear children. Rather, those younger wid-</p>
<p>ows whose vow to pray has not worked need to be redirected to more </p>
<p>fruitful activities. ey are to rule their households (oikodespoteō).</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>noun form (oikodespotēs) occurs several times in the Gospels, to refer to </p>
<p>the owner of a farm (Matt 13:27), owner of a store (Matt 13:52), owner </p>
<p>of a vineyard (Matt 20:1; 21:33), and person overseeing a household. e </p>
<p>oikodespotēs has authority to hire laborers (Matt 20:1), to oversee tenants </p>
<p>and servants,</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>to allow people in or out of the house (Luke 13:25), to</p>
<p>receive guests,</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>and take responsibility for protecting the house (Matt</p>
<p>24:43). God (and Jesus) symbolically are oikodespotēs.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Despotēs is a much stronger term than kyrios. A despotēs “denoted </p>
<p>absolute ownership and uncontrolled power” and is “one who has legal </p>
<p>control and authority over persons, such as subjects or slaves.”</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>Hence,</p>
<p>it is used for a human “master”</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> and metaphorically as a title for God.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> </p>
<p>us, the younger widows are indeed to become rulers of their house-</p>
<p>holds. “Keep house” (NASB)</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>or “take care of their homes” (TEV) are</p>
<p>phrases not strong enough to translate this word. More accurate trans-</p>
<p>lations are “rule their houses” (NTME), “guide the house” (KJV), and </p>
<p>“preside over a home” (NEB).</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>If women are explicitly told to rule their</p>
<p>households, the interpreter has little exegetical basis to say 3:5, 12 sup-</p>
<p>ports male leadership and males being “heads” of households. Paul does </p>
<p>not clarify exactly what is involved in the younger widows ruling their </p>
<p>55. Oikodespoteō, literally, is “to rule” (despoteō) “a house” (oikos). LSJ, 1204 ren-</p>
<p>ders oikodespoteō “to be master of a house or head of a family.”</p>
<p>56. Matt 21:33; Luke 14:16–24.</p>
<p>57. Mark 14:14. Cf. 2 John 1, 10–11.</p>
<p>58. Matt 10:25; 20:1; 21:33–42.</p>
<p>59. ayer, 130; BDAG, 220.</p>
<p>60. 1 Tim 6:1–2; Titus 2:9; 1 Pet 2:18.</p>
<p>61. Luke 2:29; Acts 4:24; Jude 4; Rev 6:10.</p>
<p>62. BDAG, 695.</p>
<p>63. “Manage their households” (CEV, NRSV) brings out some but not all of the </p>
<p>aspects of being a “master.”</p>
