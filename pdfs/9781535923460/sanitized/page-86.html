<p>1 Timothy 2–370</p>
<p>is aected.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>1 Timothy 2:13 is descriptive, not prescriptive, even as the</p>
<p>“curses” in Genesis 3:16–19 are descriptive, not prescriptive.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Eve, in contrast, is a prototype</p>
<p>155</p>
<p>of someone who sins because (s)he</p>
<p>is deceived: And so Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having </p>
<p>been deceived, came to a state of transgression (2:14). Why was Adam </p>
<p>not deceived but Eve was? Verses 13 and 14 are connected by the simple </p>
<p>connective kai (“and”), which may be translated and so,</p>
<p>156</p>
<p>as in Matthew</p>
<p>5:15 when a lamp is placed on a lampstand “and so” it gives light to all </p>
<p>in the household. Adam having been formed rst is the key idea in the </p>
<p>rst clause that aects the second clause: why Adam was not deceived. I </p>
<p>have suggested that form (2:13) has to do with education. Others have </p>
<p>suggested that rst formed has to do with precedence in authority as a </p>
<p>rstborn.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p>But does the Bible ever claim that every male who is rstborn</p>
<p>has precedence in authority that aects knowledge of the truth? In addi-</p>
<p>tion, rstborn children are not always chosen to rule, as in the example </p>
<p>of David, the youngest son, in Jesse’s family, chosen by the Lord to rule </p>
<p>Israel.</p>
<p>158</p>
<p>And, when is resistance to deception a characteristic of only</p>
<p>rstborn sons? If God established that the rstborn always rules, it is a </p>
<p>law that God does not follow!</p>
<p>159</p>
<p>First also is not necessarily superior,</p>
<p>as Philo explains as he looks at creation: the principle of order is this, </p>
<p>creatures “begin at what is lowest in its nature, and end in the best of all” </p>
<p>(Creation 22.67). In other words, humans are superior to animals because </p>
<p>they were created in God’s image.</p>
<p>What does education have to do with deception? Deception is basi-</p>
<p>cally based on telling a lie or lies and misleading by half-truths. Paul, </p>
<p>most likely refers back to the earliest use of apataō in the Bible when used </p>
<p>by Eve herself as she made her excuse to God: “e serpent deceived me </p>
<p>153. Probably, 1 Cor 11:3–16 is closer to 1 Tim 2:9–10 since both discuss the </p>
<p>proper attire for prayer. See Spencer 1990a: 41–50. Payne (2009: 403) notes that the </p>
<p>similarity between 1 Cor 11 and 1 Tim 2 is that since woman was “formed” out of man, </p>
<p>she should respect man as her source.</p>
<p>154. See Spencer 1985: 34–42.</p>
<p>155. See 1 Tim 1:16.</p>
<p>156. Robertson 1934: 1183.</p>
<p>157. E.g., Hurley (1981: 207–8) explains that the rstborn inherited responsibility </p>
<p>of leadership in the home and in worship.</p>
<p>158. 1 Sam 16:11–12; 1 Chr 2:13–15. </p>
<p>159. See Webb (2001: 136–39) for an extensive list. e younger Ephraim is chosen </p>
<p>over the rstborn Manasseh (Gen 48:14–19); elder Esau serves younger Jacob (Gen </p>
<p>25:23).</p>
