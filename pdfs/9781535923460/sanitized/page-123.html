<p>A Good Minister (4:6–10) 107</p>
<p>Instead of holding themselves away from (abstain, apechō)</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>certain</p>
<p>foods, God had clearly communicated to Peter and Paul and the other </p>
<p>disciples that, even as Gentiles could be welcomed into the believing </p>
<p>community, also all foods—clean and unclean—could be eaten.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>Instead</p>
<p>of an attitude of rejection, believers who know well the truth (epiginōskō) </p>
<p>should receive with thanksgiving</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>everything created by God (4:3–4).</p>
<p>e earth, its plant life, its lights, its animals, “everything” God has made </p>
<p>was “very good” and blessed.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>As David sings: “To the Lord belong the</p>
<p>earth and everything in it, the world and all its inhabitants” (Ps 24:1 REB; </p>
<p>1 Cor 10:26). Flesh, in its literal sense, is good (1 Tim 3:16). e resurrec-</p>
<p>tion, too, would be a bodily one (1 Cor 15:44). Even food oered to pagan </p>
<p>idols could be received if God is acknowledged as the Creator because in </p>
<p>prayer God renders the food holy (4:5).</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>A Good Minister (4:6–10)</p>
<p>Paul now directs his comments directly to Timothy: Making known </p>
<p>these things to the brothers and sisters, you will be a good minister </p>
<p>of Christ Jesus, being nourished by the words of the faith and by the </p>
<p>good teaching which you followed; but the godless and old-women’s </p>
<p>myths—decline; rather train for godliness; for bodily training for a </p>
<p>little is protable but godliness for all things is protable, a promise </p>
<p>having life for now and the future (4:6–8). We are reminded that this </p>
<p>is a letter from Paul, the mentor, to one person, Timothy, the mentored, </p>
<p>about a church (in Ephesus, 1:3 vs. 6:21-plural “you”). We listen in as </p>
<p>Paul claries what he wants Timothy to teach the Ephesians (1:3, 18). </p>
<p>roughout this letter, Paul intersperses personal comments directly to </p>
<p>Timothy. Timothy too is in an environment of false knowledge and needs </p>
<p>to guard his own process of salvation, sanctication, and knowledge of </p>
<p>the truth. Already, he has exhorted Timothy to “ght with them the good </p>
<p>ght having faith and a good conscience” (1:18–19) and, in order to help </p>
<p>others, to “know how it is necessary to behave in God’s home” (3:15). </p>
<p>But now Paul has an extended section addressed directly to Timothy </p>
<p>33. ayer, 57; BDAG, 103.</p>
<p>34. Acts 10:12–15; 11:6–12; Rom 14:14, 17; Gal 2:12–14; Col 2:16, 21–23; Heb </p>
<p>13:9; Mark 7:14–23.</p>
<p>35. See 1 Tim 2:1.</p>
<p>36. Gen 1:10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 28, 31.</p>
