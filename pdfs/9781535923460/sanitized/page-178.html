<p>1 Timothy 6:3–21162</p>
<p>e reason God blesses materially is so that people can then “share </p>
<p>abundantly in every good work” (2 Cor 9:8). Paul had illustrated by ex-</p>
<p>ample to the Ephesians that by working they could help those who were </p>
<p>less strong, citing Jesus’ own words: “It is more blessed to give than to </p>
<p>receive” (Acts 20:34–35). Giving helps others, but also oneself (1 Tim </p>
<p>6:9–10). Paul uses four synonymous phrases to describe this same point. </p>
<p>e rst verb is the most general: to do good (6:18). For instance, when </p>
<p>Tabitha (Dorcas) made clothing for the widows, she did good works </p>
<p>(Acts 9:36–39). Wealthy women at Ephesus were already encouraged </p>
<p>to dress with “good deeds” rather than aunting their wealth in nery </p>
<p>during worship (2:9–10). A true widow also must have done many good </p>
<p>deeds (5:10). Paul had explained this message to King Agrippa: “I was </p>
<p>proclaiming (to Jew and Gentile) to repent and to turn to God, doing </p>
<p>works worthy of repentance” (Acts 26:20). e second verb is metaphori-</p>
<p>cal: to be rich in good works (6:18). As God provides richly to humans </p>
<p>physically and spiritually (6:17), so too humans should provide richly for </p>
<p>others (6:18), but these “riches” are good deeds.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>e third phrase has</p>
<p>two parts: to be free to give, ready to share (6:18). ese two adjectives </p>
<p>are more concrete.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e last adjective (koinōnikos, share, 6:18) summarizes the list of </p>
<p>exhortations to the rich. A koinōnos was a business partnership, such as </p>
<p>the shing partnership of James, John, and Simon Peter (Luke 5:10). A </p>
<p>koinos or koineion could refer to a religious, professional, or social as-</p>
<p>sociation or club. ese clubs would provide benets for their members, </p>
<p>including some social services, such as burial sites and banquets.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>Christians in Jerusalem as a religious group went further—they had all </p>
<p>things in common (Acts 2:44). Paul had already encouraged the elders </p>
<p>who taught to be given honorariums (1 Tim 5:17–18). Hospitality is an-</p>
<p>other way to share (Rom 12:13).</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>By the rich sharing their riches, they</p>
<p>120. See Titus 3:5; Acts 14:17.</p>
<p>121. Eumetadotos signies “to share well” or to be “ready or free to impart; liberal,” </p>
<p>“generous” (ayer, 256, 260, 404; BDAG, 409). One reason for former thieves to work </p>
<p>and not steal was to “share” (metadidōmi) with those having needs (Eph 4:28). Jesus </p>
<p>had taught his disciples to “share” extra food and clothing with others (Luke 3:11).</p>
<p>122. NewDocs 2:49; LSJ, 968.</p>
<p>123. Hebrews exhorts Christians to “not neglect the doing of good and sharing </p>
<p>(koinōnia), for such sacrices God nds pleasing” (13:16). e Philippians were a </p>
<p>unique congregation Paul allowed to contribute regularly nancially to his own min-</p>
<p>istry (Phil 1:5; 4:10–18).</p>
