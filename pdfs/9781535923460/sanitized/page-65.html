<p>Godly Peaceful Lives (2:1–15) 49</p>
<p>God and to persevere in their faith and thus to be saved.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>To be saved is</p>
<p>to be forgiven one’s sins (1:13–15) and, thus, be puried, made acceptable </p>
<p>to a holy God.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>A believer is puried by God, but must work on being</p>
<p>pure in practice. In the process of being saved, a believer should come to </p>
<p>a thorough knowledge</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>of the truth. Otherwise, false knowledge can</p>
<p>mislead a believer away from truth</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> and, eventually, away from salva-</p>
<p>tion, as in the case of Hymenaeus and Alexander (1:20). e importance </p>
<p>of truth is a continual theme for Paul.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>Paul is adamant that as an apostle</p>
<p>he is telling the truth (2:7). e church also should be founded on the </p>
<p>truth (3:15). Truth is durable, dependable, real, and an essential aspect </p>
<p>of God’s nature.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>One aspect of truth is to know God (e.g., Eph 1:17) and God’s na-</p>
<p>ture which is apparent in the next sentence: For God is one, one is also </p>
<p>a mediator between God and humans, human Christ Jesus, the One </p>
<p>having given himself as a ransom on behalf of all, the witness to his </p>
<p>own times, for which I myself was appointed a preacher and apostle </p>
<p>(I speak truth, I do not lie), a teacher of Gentiles in faith and truth </p>
<p>(2:5–7). A Jew would heartily arm the rst clause (2:5), as Moses sum-</p>
<p>marizes: “Hear Israel, the Lord our God (elohim), the Lord is one” (Deut </p>
<p>6:4). In Deuteronomy, as a result, believers are to love the Lord with their </p>
<p>whole being (vv. 5–6). Jews were renowned in ancient times for their </p>
<p>belief in one God, symbolized, for example, by Judith’s proclamation to </p>
<p>the Gentile magistrates: We “acknowledge no god but the Lord” (Jdt 8:20 </p>
<p>REB). e Roman historian Tacitus describes the Jews as despising the </p>
<p>gods, having “a purely spiritual monotheism ... for them, the Most High </p>
<p>and Eternal cannot be portrayed by human hands and will never pass </p>
<p>away” (Hist. 5.5). Why did Paul include the clause God is one in this </p>
<p>chapter? He appears to imply that God is unique in that God genuinely </p>
<p>wants people to be saved (2:4). God also is the only being capable of </p>
<p>saving people and the only deity before whom a human needs approval. </p>
<p>e Godhead is also able to accomplish salvation completely. e One </p>
