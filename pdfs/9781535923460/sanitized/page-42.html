<p>1 Timothy 126</p>
<p>(3:9). As in 1 Timothy, the genealogies are endless (aperantos, 1:4). While </p>
<p>aperantos can be used in a positive way to describe God as innite (Job </p>
<p>36:26), here it is used in a negative way to describe activities that never </p>
<p>come to an end; they are without conclusion.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>ese are speculations,</p>
<p>arguments about topics that lead to spiritual error.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>How better should the Ephesians spend their time? ey should </p>
<p>turn their minds and actions toward stewardship of God’s household </p>
<p>(oikonomia, 1:4). In 1 Timothy, they are exhorted to aspire to be over-</p>
<p>seers, stewards over God’s household, even the faith itself (1:4; 3:1).</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What, then, is the goal of stewards of God’s household (1:4)? Whereas </p>
<p>the Sanhedrin ordered (parangelia) the apostles not to teach (Acts 5:28)</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and the magistrate ordered the jailer to imprison Paul and Silas (Acts </p>
<p>16:22–24), Paul reminds the listeners that they were ordered by Jesus to </p>
<p>do a positive action, to love (1:5; e.g., John 13:34–35). Love is an impor-</p>
<p>tant aspect of sound doctrine and, therefore, an important theme in 1, 2 </p>
<p>Timothy. Faith and love come from Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>Paul was redeemed by</p>
<p>faith and love (1:14), women can be saved by them (2:15), and Timothy is </p>
<p>to pursue them.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>Although eventually the Ephesians learn to resist false</p>
<p>teaching,</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> the need to love persistently is more dicult for them to at-</p>
<p>tain. About thirty years later (c. A.D. 95), John warns them “you have </p>
<p>forsaken your rst love” (Rev 2:4 NIV) and shortly thereaer Ignatius </p>
<p>exhorts them to love their bishop Onesimus, himself “a man of inexpress-</p>
<p>ible love” (Ign. Eph. 1:3).</p>
<p>Such love ows out from three bases: a clean heart and a good con-</p>
<p>science and a genuine faith (1:5). e heart represents the inward part </p>
<p>of a person, one’s thoughts.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>Jesus describes an impure heart as one with</p>
<p>evil thoughts about “murder, adultery, sexual immorality, the, false wit-</p>
<p>ness, slander” (Matt 15:18–20). In contrast, Jesus taught: “Blessed are the </p>
<p>pure in heart, for they themselves will see God” (Matt 5:8). “Love” that </p>
<p>arises out of evil intentions cannot be genuine.</p>
