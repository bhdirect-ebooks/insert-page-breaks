<p>Godly Peaceful Lives (2:1–15) 73</p>
<p>forbidden fruit. e entire state of humanity and nature was aected by </p>
<p>their actions: enslavement to sin and death. Eve’s deception aected the </p>
<p>state into which she entered. So, too, if the women at Ephesus continued </p>
<p>in being deceived by false teaching, they too would enter a state of trans-</p>
<p>gression. And, as the earth became fallen, so too the church at Ephesus </p>
<p>would fall. (Already some women were “turning aer Satan” [5:15].)</p>
<p>Instead, Paul had begun a process to address the educational limi-</p>
<p>tations on women, especially in such a syncretistic area as Ephesus, by </p>
<p>commanding that the women learn the truth so they could understand </p>
<p>fully the Christian message, not be deceived, and, then, when they taught, </p>
<p>they would bring spiritual life and salvation to their listeners.</p>
<p>Paul states clearly that Eve need not stay in her state: But she will be </p>
<p>saved through the Childbirth, if they might remain in faith and love </p>
<p>and holiness with wisdom (2:15). Salvation is an important theme in the </p>
<p>Pastoral letters.</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>e verb sōzō is always used in a spiritual sense by Paul</p>
<p>and in the Pastorals it refers to the forgiveness of sins and purication </p>
<p>by means of God’s mercy so that believers persevere in order to know </p>
<p>the truth, lead a holy life, and inherit God’s kingdom. God, the Trinity, is </p>
<p>involved in the process of salvation.</p>
<p>170</p>
<p>Paul then uses the preposition dia</p>
<p>with the genitive case of childbirth (teknogonia) to signify through an </p>
<p>intermediate personal agent. e agent comes “in between the non-at-</p>
<p>tainment and the attainment of the object in view,”</p>
<p>171</p>
<p>as in Matthew 1:22:</p>
<p>“e Lord spoke through the prophet.” e prophet is the intermediate </p>
<p>agent between the Lord (the source) and speaking (the ultimate end). In </p>
<p>the same way, in “the man through the woman” (1 Cor 11:12), God is the </p>
<p>ultimate agent, but the woman is the intermediate agent between God </p>
<p>and a man’s birth.</p>
<p>172</p>
<p>One historic interpretation was to understand the</p>
<p>169. See 1 Tim 2:3–4; Titus 1:3; 2:14; 3:4–7.</p>
<p>170. 1 Tim 1:15; 2:4; 4:16; 2 Tim 1:9; 4:18; Titus 3:5–7. For a succinct summary of </p>
<p>key elements in Paul’s understanding of salvation, see Rom 10:9–10; 1 Cor 15:2–11; </p>
<p>Eph 2:4–10. Most of the N.T. references use sōzō metaphorically for a spiritual sense, </p>
<p>salvation from eternal death. However, the N.T. also uses sōzō literally to refer to pres-</p>
<p>ervation from death (Matt 8:25; 14:30; 27:40, 42, 49; Mark 3:4; 13:20; 15:30–31; Luke </p>
<p>6:9; 23:35, 37, 39; John 12:27; Acts 27:20, 31) including from illness (Matt 9:21–22; </p>
<p>Mark 5:23, 28, 34; 6:56; 10:52; Luke 8:48, 50; 18:42; John 11:12; Acts 14:9) and demon-</p>
<p>possession (Luke 8:36). LSJ (1748). </p>
<p>171. Robertson 1934: 581–82.</p>
<p>172. Paul does not use dia and the accusative case which would then mean “a </p>
<p>woman will be saved ‘because of, for the sake of, on account of’ the childbearing” </p>
<p>(Robertson 1934: 583). Childbirth (or childbearing) would then somehow cause </p>
<p>women to be saved.</p>
