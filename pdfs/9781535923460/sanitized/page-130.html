<p>behavior, conduct.”</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> One’s behavior may be a negative</p>
<p>82</p>
<p> or a positive</p>
<p>83</p>
<p> </p>
<p>example. Here Paul wants Timothy to be a positive example. Conduct </p>
<p>balances with word. Conduct is a general term that includes the more </p>
<p>specic attributes to follow.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>Living out of the faith is always important</p>
<p>but especially in a situation where one is conscious of nonbelievers’ po-</p>
<p>tential criticisms.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why does Paul choose love, faith, and purity? Love is the trait </p>
<p>rst highlighted as the motivating goal of Paul’s instructions.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>Faith</p>
<p>and love are intertwined together because love is a reection of one’s </p>
<p>faith in Christ. Purity or “chastity” (hagneia) is highlighted for Timo-</p>
<p>thy probably because he is a young man, possibly single, working with </p>
<p>young women (1 Tim 5:2).</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>is same term and its corresponding verb</p>
<p>(hagnizō) were used in the Old and New Testaments for ceremonial pu-</p>
<p>rication.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p> Although used to describe the purication of Levite priests</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and the Israelite people in general,</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>it was also used of the Nazirite vow</p>
<p>to be “set apart” for a specied time limit by abstaining from wine and all </p>
<p>products of grapes, from haircuts, and from approaching any dead bod-</p>
<p>ies (Num 6:2–8). Timothy himself seems to have abstained from wine </p>
<p>(1 Tim 5:23). Hagneia was also used to describe the permanent purity </p>
<p>which Jesus as the slain “lamb” brought and also holiness as the oppo-</p>
<p>site of sin.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy 4:12, hagneia might then serve as a summary</p>
<p>attribute of the whole list encouraging Timothy to lead a puried and </p>
<p>dedicated life which included purity of behavior (5:2) and self instruction </p>
<p>because heterodox teaching and learning is the primary problem at Ephesus that Paul </p>
<p>le Timothy to address (1:3–4).</p>

<p>82. E.g., Gal 1:13; Eph 4:22; 1 Pet 1:18; 2 Pet 2:7.</p>
<p>83. E.g., 1 Tim 3:15 (verb anastrephō); 2 Cor 1:12 (verb); Jas 3:13; 1 Pet 1:15; 2 </p>
<p>Pet 3:11.</p>
<p>84. “Word” and “conduct” are placed together also in Heb 13:7 to refer to leaders, </p>
<p>whom the readers are exhorted to imitate.</p>
<p>85. See 1 Tim 3:2; Titus 1:6; 1 Pet 2:12; 3:1–2, 16.</p>
<p>86. See 1 Tim 1:5.</p>
<p>87. See Titus 2:5.</p>
<p>88. E.g., Acts 21:24, 26; John 11:55.</p>
<p>89. Num 8:21; 1 Chr 15:12.</p>
<p>90. Exod 19:10; Num 11:18.</p>
<p>91. Jas 4:8; 1 Pet 1:19–22; 1 John 3:3. Sexual connotations may be found in the </p>
<p>root hagnos “pure” (Titus 2:5; 2 Cor 11:2) (Mounce 2000: 260). See also 1 ess 4:3–8; </p>
