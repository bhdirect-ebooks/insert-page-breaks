<p>1 Timothy 2–398</p>
<p>• “vindicated in (the) spirit” (NRSV, NEB, REB);</p>
<p>305</p>
<p>• “vindicated by the Spirit” (NIV, TNIV, NLT, ESV); “justied in the </p>
<p>Spirit” (KJV); “vindicated in the Spirit” (NASB, RSV); “attested by </p>
<p>the Spirit” (JB);</p>
<p>• “declared righteous by the Spirit” (CEB); “the Spirit proved that he </p>
<p>pleased God” (CEV); “was shown to be right by the Spirit” (TEV).</p>
<p>In the Pastorals the word family of dikaioō is always a synonym of </p>
<p>“holy,” for example, holiness is a goal Timothy should seek.</p>
<p>306</p>
<p>Jesus is</p>
<p>always described as without sin or holy, the “Holy and Righteous One” </p>
<p>(e.g., Acts 3:14). e centurion declared about Jesus aer the three hour </p>
<p>darkness and Jesus’ death: “Surely this human was righteous!” (Luke </p>
<p>23:47). us, declared righteous (CEB) would be an appropriate transla-</p>
<p>tion. en, if in the rst clause in 3:16 the object is esh, in contrast, in </p>
<p>the second clause the object would be spirit referring, I think, to Jesus’ </p>
<p>human spirit. e spirit is that aspect of a human which searches one’s </p>
<p>self and knows oneself thoroughly (1 Cor 2:10–11; Prov 20:27). ere-</p>
<p>fore, the point would be that Jesus, even searched to his deepest spirit, </p>
<p>was recognized as righteous.</p>
<p>Paul describes the ministry of apostles as witnessed by “the world </p>
<p>and angels and humans” (1 Cor 4:9). Angels (3:16) are also mentioned </p>
<p>later in 1 Timothy (5:21) as witnesses, together with God and Jesus </p>
<p>Christ. Jesus’ resurrection was also witnessed by angels, who reminded </p>
<p>the women at the empty tomb that Jesus had taught them, even in Gali-</p>
<p>lee, that he would be crucied and, on the third day, be raised again (Luke </p>
<p>24:4–8).</p>
<p>Human testimony is summarized in two parts: their proclamation </p>
<p>and their belief (3:16). e book of Acts testies to the post-resurrection </p>
<p>acts of Jesus. Jesus, through the Holy Spirit, poured out the marvelous </p>
<p>acts of Pentecost (Acts 2:1–4, 33) and was also present through the </p>
<p>church (Acts 9:4–5). If the rst three verbs (manifested [phaneroō], de-</p>
<p>clared righteous [dikaioō], was seen [horaō]) give prominence to the vis-</p>
<p>ible (outward and inward), now Paul mentions the verbal. Kēryssō refers </p>
<p>to the proclamation or preaching about Jesus.</p>
<p>307</p>
<p>Paul called himself a</p>
<p>305. DHH renders “triunfó en su condición de espiritu.”</p>
<p>306. 1 Tim 6:11. See Titus 1:8; 3:7.</p>
<p>307. See 1 Tim 2:7. A kērux was “a herald, a messenger vested with public au-</p>
<p>thority, who conveyed the ocial messages of kings, magistrates, princes, military </p>
