<p>1 Timothy 6:3–21154</p>
<p>athletes who contend for a prize in the public games, including running </p>
<p>and boxing.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>Since athletes exercised as preparation for war, agōnizomai</p>
<p>also refers to armed combat (John 18:36). Paul does use the metaphor </p>
<p>to describe his own Christian life.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>Nevertheless, athletic and military</p>
<p>images are so repeatedly used in 1 and 2 Timothy when Paul directly </p>
<p>exhorts Timothy that Paul could very well be using an extended image to </p>
<p>appeal to Timothy’s own interests.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>At least he would have to be athletic</p>
<p>to resonate with all the athletic images. Possibly, his father had him train-</p>
<p>ing to be a soldier at Lystra (which was a Roman colony).</p>
<p>Here are some of the athletic/military metaphors in 1 and 2 Timothy: </p>
<p>• Order or charge (1 Tim 1:3, 5, 18; 4:11; 5:7; 6:13, 17, parangelia, </p>
<p>parangellō—can refer to a military order)</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>• May ght (1 Tim 1:18, strateuō) with them the good ght (strate-</p>
<p>ia—a military campaign)</p>
<p>• Train for godliness (1 Tim 4:7, gymnazō)</p>
<p>• Bodily training (1 Tim 4:8, gymnasia) for a little is protable</p>
<p>• We labor (1 Tim 4:10, kopiaō) and we strive (agōnizomai)</p>
<p>• Let no one despise your youth (1 Tim 4:12, neotēs—military age—</p>
<p>literal) in conduct (anastrophē—used of soldiers)</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>• Your progress (1 Tim 4:15, prokopē)</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>• Guard the deposit (1 Tim 5:21; 6:20; 2 Tim 1:12, 14; 4:15, phylassō, </p>
<p>parathēkē)</p>
<p>• Guard (1 Tim 5:22; 6:14; 2 Tim 4:7, tēreō)</p>
<p>• Pursue (1 Tim 6:11, diōkō) </p>
<p>• Keep on ghting for yourself (1 Tim 6:12, agōnizomai) the good </p>
<p>ght (agōn) ... grasp (epilambanō)</p>
