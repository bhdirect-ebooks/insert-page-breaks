<p>Introduction (1:1–2) 23</p>
<p>Paul probably met Timothy during his rst missionary journey at </p>
<p>Lystra in Pisidia, Asia Minor.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Timothy became a believer under Paul’s</p>
<p>teachings (Acts 14:6, c. A.D. 47–48). Lystra was a Roman colony situated </p>
<p>along the Via Sebaste, the Imperial Roman Road that began in Antioch, </p>
<p>Syria. A hilly country, Lystra had a lavish water supply, fertile soil, and </p>
<p>gardens. Several coins boasted of its water supply by showing a river. </p>
<p>Residents there would be acquainted not only with Greek and Latin but </p>
<p>also with the ancient Lycaonian language.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> Timothy and other new be-</p>
<p>lievers from Lystra probably journeyed with Paul and Barnabas to nearby </p>
<p>Iconium and Antioch,</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>a journey of about 25–100 miles one way. At</p>
<p>Lystra, Timothy and others witnessed a man crippled from birth spring </p>
<p>up and walk, the worshipers of Zeus and Hermes tried to worship Paul </p>
<p>and Barnabas, and Jews from Antioch and Iconium stoned Paul. Possibly, </p>
<p>Timothy was one of the disciples who ran outside the city to help Paul </p>
<p>and saw him stand up and return to the city.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>When Paul returned to Lystra during his second missionary jour-</p>
<p>ney, he wanted Timothy to accompany him and Silas. Timothy’s reputa-</p>
<p>tion as a Christian had been stellar not only in his own hometown but </p>
<p>also in Iconium, a day’s journey away (Acts 16:2–3). Timothy enlisted in </p>
<p>Paul’s traveling ministry team (Acts 16:8–11), traveling to Philippi, es-</p>
<p>salonica, and Beroea in Macedonia.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Timothy eventually joined Paul,</p>
<p>Prisca, and Aquila at Ephesus.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Timothy and Erastus preceded Paul to</p>
<p>Macedonia and Corinth in Greece.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> Timothy with many others accom-</p>
<p>panied Paul from Corinth, Greece, to Macedonia (Acts 20:4–6), being </p>
<p>part of Paul’s group of ministers who were bringing the generous dona-</p>
<p>tions of Christians for the starving believers in Judea.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Timothy was with</p>
<p>Paul when he was under house arrest in Rome, from which Timothy le </p>
<p>for Philippi.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Aer Paul’s release, Timothy remained in Ephesus when</p>
<p>12. Timothy may have heard about Paul and Barnabas’ earlier preaching ministry </p>
<p>in nearby Iconium (Acts 13:51–14:5).</p>
<p>13. Acts 14:11; Ramsay 1908: 407–15. Indigenous languages, such as Lycaonian, </p>
<p>survived among later Christians in Anatolia (Mitchell 1993, 1:173). </p>
<p>14. 2 Tim 3:11; Acts 14:21. Or, Paul could have been referring to Acts 16:4.</p>
<p>15. Acts 14:8–20; 2 Cor 11:25; Robertson 1930 (Acts): 214–15.</p>
<p>16. Acts 17:14–15; 18:1, 5; Phil 4:15–16.</p>
<p>17. Acts 19:22; 1 Cor 4:17; 2 Cor 1:1, 19.</p>
<p>18. Acts 19:22; 1 Cor 16:10–11.</p>
<p>19. Rom 15:25–27; 2 Cor 8:1–7, 10–11; 9:1–5.</p>
<p>20. Phil 1:1; 2:19; Col 1:1; Phlm 1.</p>
