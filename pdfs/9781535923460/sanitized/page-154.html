<p>1 Timothy 5:3—6:2138</p>
<p>a fault, “take with you one or two (people), so that, on (the) evidence of </p>
<p>two or three witnesses, every word might stand” (Matt 18:16). Someone </p>
<p>might unfairly accuse an elder (Deut 19:16–19). Although the church did </p>
<p>not execute capital punishment, if the accusation were serious and accu-</p>
<p>rate, the elder could be treated as an outsider by the church (Matt 18:17). </p>
<p>Timothy did not want to encourage reprisals against the elders, especially </p>
<p>possible in an environment of critical self-deprivation and heresy (1 Tim </p>
<p>1:3; 4:1–3). e Accuser (Rev 12:10) (who is opportunistic) might very </p>
<p>well instigate accusations when demonic teachings were rampant (1 Tim </p>
<p>4:1).</p>
<p>In contrast, Paul commands Timothy to rebuke the people who </p>
<p>keep on sinning (5:20). ese are not people who sin and repent, because </p>
<p>then everyone would always have to stand publically to confess their </p>
<p>wrongdoings. e goal is to bring unrepented deeds out in the open for </p>
<p>the sake of clarity and truth,</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>because if persistent sin is not discouraged,</p>
<p>some may think it is encouraged. e goal is to discourage false accusa-</p>
<p>tions and unwholesome, sinful behavior.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul encourages Timothy to watch that he is not partial: without </p>
<p>discrimination, doing nothing by partiality (5:21). Timothy must not </p>
<p>make a judgment before witnesses speak (prokrima, 5:19)</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>because he</p>
<p>is inclined towards someone but inclined against another. Especially in </p>
<p>the midst of heresy, leaders need to watch out for natural prejudices. God, </p>
<p>in contrast, is always impartial, never judging a human by supercial </p>
<p>criteria.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>Paul calls God and God-incarnate Christ Jesus and the elect</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> </p>
<p>angels (5:21) as witnesses of Paul’s charge and Timothy’s actions. e </p>
<p>angels and the Father are also witnesses to Jesus’ acknowledgement of </p>
<p>humans who have acknowledged Jesus.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>e angels celebrate in heaven</p>
<p>when a sinner repents (Luke 15:10) and grieve when worshipers of the </p>
<p>beast suer judgment (Rev 14:9–11). e angels will return together with </p>
<p>88. See Titus 1:13 vs. Gal 6:1.</p>
<p>89. Deut 17:13; 19:18–20; m. Sanh. 10:4.</p>
<p>90. A prokrima is in Latin a praejudicium, a preliminary hearing (LSJ, 1487).</p>
<p>91. E.g., Acts 10:34; Spencer 1995: 191–92.</p>
<p>92. Eklektos can indicate “special,” or “precious,” as in 1 Pet 2:4, 6, 9. e angels </p>
<p>are special to God.</p>
<p>93. Mark 8:38; Luke 12:8–9; Rev 3:5.</p>
