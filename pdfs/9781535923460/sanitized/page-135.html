<p>Timothy Should Become an Example (4:11—5:2) 119</p>

<p>Fusing the Horizons: Progress in the Christian Life</p>
<p>In George MacDonald’s novel, The Princess and Curdie, the Grandmother </p>
<p>explains to Curdie: </p>
<p>When you met your father on the hill to-night, you stood and spoke </p>
<p>together on the same spot; and although one of you was going up </p>
<p>and the other coming down, at a little distance no one could have </p>
<p>told which was bound in one direction and which in the other. Just so </p>
<p>two people may be at the same spot in manners and behaviour, and </p>
<p>yet one may be getting better and the other worse, which is just the </p>
<p>greatest of all differences that could possibly exist between them.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>Paul has urged Timothy to progress on becoming a positive model in right </p>
<p>doctrine, conduct, love, faith, purity, reading, encouragement, teaching, </p>
<p>and in use of his spiritual gift. How do contemporary pastors “progress” in </p>
<p>their lives as Christians?</p>
<p>Rev. Dr. William David Spencer</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>uses reading the Bible and praying</p>
<p>each morning as a framework to orient the rest of the day. Even a brief Bible </p>
<p>reading, especially if systematic, affects one’s ability to think more from </p>
<p>God’s perspective: “That is one thing we can learn from the Lord’s prayer.” </p>
<p>It begins by focusing on God</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>(“Father, hallowed be your name. Let your</p>
<p>kingdom come,” Luke 11:2). Thus, “when you encounter daily experiences, </p>
<p>the framework is set which colors the way one reacts.”</p>
<p>Rev. Dr. Leslie McKinney</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>progresses in her Christian life by drawing</p>
<p>support from community. This support base can be other pastors, a spiritual </p>
<p>director, a group of women or men, or a few good friends. Among such </p>
<p>people, pastors can share their hearts and those things with which they </p>
<p>struggle: “It is really important to process feelings if you want to be healthy </p>
