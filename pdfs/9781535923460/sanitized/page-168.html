<p>1 Timothy 6:3–21152</p>
<p>valuable.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> Coins were made of silver.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> Silver is a shiny god</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>one can</p>
<p>see, not an invisible one (6:16). While at Ephesus, Paul’s coworkers Gaius </p>
<p>and Aristarchus had been attacked by the mob because Demetrius and </p>
<p>the other silversmiths had been threatened when they observed that less </p>
<p>people were buying their silver shrines of Artemis (Acts 19:24–29). Paul </p>
<p>had made a point of telling the Ephesian elders that he had not coveted </p>
<p>or desired their silver (Acts 20:33).</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>e root of love of money sprouts</p>
<p>forth all kinds of evil. e love of money, when it becomes the goal </p>
<p>one reaches aer, has two results: it misleads (apoplanaō) and pierces </p>
<p>(peripeirō) (6:10). Silver looks attractive, secure, and brings many worldly </p>
<p>pleasures and power but in reality silver eventually perishes (Jas 5:3). It </p>
<p>does not save; only Christ’s blood saves (1 Pet 1:18–19). It does not satisfy </p>
<p>(Eccl 5:9). It leads people away from truth. Meat can be pierced or “run </p>
<p>through” with skewers on a spit.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy, those who love money</p>
<p>end up piercing themselves by many pains or sorrows. At the bottom of </p>
<p>the pit, the trap pierces them. It does not lead to “righteousness, godli-</p>
<p>ness, faith, love, perseverance, gentleness” (6:11).</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>Pursue Righteousness (6:11–16)</p>
<p>Paul oers a two-pronged solution to Timothy: But you, O</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>person of</p>
<p>God, ee these things; rather pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, </p>
<p>love, perseverance, gentleness (6:11). Timothy is to keep eeing false </p>
<p>teaching, the desire to be rich, and the love of money (6:3–5, 9–10), </p>
<p>because he is God’s person.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> Instead, he is to keep pursuing God’s at-</p>
<p>tributes (most of which have been mentioned already in the letter). Je-</p>
<p>sus who is fully holy or righteous is a model for Timothy.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>e whole</p>
<p>message about Jesus is summarized as godliness (3:16), a way to live, </p>
<p>54. Matt 25:27; 28:12; 1 Cor 3:12; 2 Tim 2:20.</p>
<p>55. Luke 9:3; Acts 7:16; 8:20.</p>
<p>56. Acts 17:29; Rev 9:20.</p>
<p>57. Cf. Judas, Ananias, Sapphira (John 12:4–6; Matt 26:14–16; Acts 5:1–11).</p>

<p>59. Rhetorician Longinus, a later contemporary of Paul, sees the danger of the love </p>
<p>of money because evils accompany it, lives are ruined, the material or mortal is overly </p>
<p>valued, and people live for nancial gain (Subl. 44.6–10). </p>
