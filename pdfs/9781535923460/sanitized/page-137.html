<p>Timothy Should Become an Example (4:11—5:2) 121</p>
<p>For ancient Jews, Greeks, and Romans, elders were highly es-</p>
<p>teemed.</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>e Mishnah recommends “at thirty for authority, at forty for</p>
<p>discernment, at y for counsel, at sixty to be an elder” (m. ‘Abot 5:21). </p>
<p>According to Overstreet, an elder (presbytēs) is in the sixth of the seven </p>
<p>stages of life when someone is y through y-six years of age, when </p>
<p>gray hairs appear. A gerōn is in the nal stage of life between sixty and </p>
<p>eighty.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p> e elders are known for their good counsel (1 Kgs 12:6–15).</p>
<p>131</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Being old is an esteemed stage of life: “Grey hair is a crown of splendor; </p>
<p>it is attained in the way of righteousness.”</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>us, an Old Testament</p>
<p>law commanded: “Stand up in the presence of the aged, show respect </p>
<p>for the elderly (presbyteros) and revere your God. I am the Lord” (Lev </p>
<p>19:32 TNIV). If Timothy was supposed to listen to the elders, as if they </p>
<p>were his fathers and mothers (Prov 23:22), what should he do when they </p>
<p>had to listen to him?</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>He was to treat them and all in the church with</p>
<p>the deference and love he would use for his own father and mother and </p>
<p>brother and sister.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>e young (neos, 5:2) would be people of the same age as Timothy,</p>
<p>135</p>
<p> </p>
<p>probably between twenty-one to twenty-eight.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p> us, Timothy’s great-</p>
<p>est challenge would be relating to those denitely older than he and, most </p>
<p>likely, in positions of authority (elders) and those of his own age who </p>
<p>might not respect an equal. e metaphor of a family would t all of </p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p> </p>
<p>129. See Titus 2:2. E.g., Plato, Leg. 9. 879B-C: “e view that should be held by </p>
<p>everyone—man, woman and child—is this, that the older is greatly more revered than </p>
<p>the younger ... whosoever, man or woman, exceeds himself in age by twenty years he </p>
<p>shall regard as a father or a mother” (Cicero, O. 1.34.122).</p>

<p>131. Job 32:4 vs. Lam 5:12.</p>
<p>132. Prov 16:31 TNIV. See also Prov 20:29.</p>
<p>133. Presbuteros is also used in Titus 1:5 and throughout 1 Tim 5:1, 2, 17, 19.</p>
<p>134. Children were to honor their own father and mother (Exod 20:12). Paul </p>
<p>treated congregations as a father would his own children (1 ess 2:11–12).</p>
<p>135. See 1 Tim 4:12 and Titus 1:5.</p>
