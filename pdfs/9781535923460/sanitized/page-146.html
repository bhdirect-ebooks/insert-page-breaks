<p>1 Timothy 5:3—6:2130</p>
<p>the widow has not only done good actions witnessed by others, but has </p>
<p>followed aer (“devoted herself to”) every good work (5:10).</p>
<p>In contrast to arming mature Christian widows, Timothy needs </p>
<p>to redirect younger widows: But refuse younger widows; for when, </p>
<p>wishing to marry, they might become arrogant against Christ, having </p>
<p>condemnation, since they nullied the rst promise; and, at the same </p>
<p>time also, they learn to be idle, going around the households, and they </p>
<p>learn to be not only idle but also talkers of falsehood and supersti-</p>
<p>tious people, speaking the things of that of which there is no need </p>
<p>(5:11–13). In the same way as Timothy is to keep away from or guard </p>
<p>against godless and old women’s myths (4:7) and Titus is to keep away </p>
from divisive persons (Titus 3:10), Timothy is to keep widows younger
<p>than sixty from joining the widow’s order of prayer (5:11). Otherwise, the </p>
<p>ramications could be serious. Paul provides two basic reasons: one has </p>
<p>to do with breaking a vow (5:11–12), the second has to do with how the </p>
<p>widows ll up the time, instead of constantly praying (5:13). Paul uses a </p>
<p>rare word, katastrēniaō where the preposition kata (“down”) intensies </p>
<p>the verb strēniaō (“to be wanton, to live luxuriously,” “run riot,” “of bulls </p>
<p>running wild”).</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>e younger widows exhibit a restlessness that becomes</p>
<p>arrogance or “insolence” against Christ.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>ey had made a promise or</p>
<p>“pledge”</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>not to marry again and by nullifying it are now condemned</p>
<p>(5:12). Children who do not take care of parents deny the faith (5:8). </p>
<p>Here the younger widows also deny their faith or promise made in trust </p>
<p>(5:12).</p>
<p>Paul had told the Galatians that “no one can set aside or add to a </p>
<p>human covenant that has been duly established” (3:15 NIV), but these </p>
<p>widows were doing just that, setting aside the covenant they had made </p>
<p>with Christ. Unlike the women (and men) who may have taken their </p>
<p>vows lightly then (and now), for God, keeping a vow is very important: </p>
<p>“Fulll what you vow. It is better that you should not vow than that you </p>
<p>40. ayer, 591; LSJ, 1654; BDAG, 949. Const. ap. 3.1<span class="ws244"> agrees the verb refers to n<span class="_ _1" />ot </span></p>
<p>keeping a promise. </p>
<p>41. Strēnos, LSJ, 1654. Katastrēniaō (5:11) is oen dened in physical terms (live </p>
<p>luxuriously or sensually), “be governed by strong physical desire” (BDAG, 528), which </p>
<p>may be the basis for the change of the younger widows now choosing to marry. How-</p>
<p>ever, since the object of the verb is Christ, the action is an oense against Christ, and </p>
<p>is explained in the appositive clause since they nullied the rst promise (v. 12), the </p>
<p>denition of arrogance seems contextually appropriate or “to become or wax wanton” </p>
<p>against someone (BDAG, 528).</p>
<p>42. LSJ, 1408.</p>
