<p>Pursue Righteousness (6:11–16) 153</p>
<p>dedicating oneself to please God in one’s words and actions.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>Paul had</p>
<p>several times exhorted Timothy to be godly, rather than ungodly.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>battle at Ephesus is all about faith and love. Christ’s faithfulness and love </p>
<p>are reected in Christ’s followers.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hypomonē (perseverance or “patience”) is also a trait that comes </p>
<p>from God. It is the ability to persevere until the end.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> It is itself strength-</p>
<p>ened by hardships.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>e elders in Crete, like Timothy, had to learn faith,</p>
<p>love, and perseverance (Titus 2:2). Paul himself modeled faith, love, and </p>
<p>perseverance (2 Tim 3:10). Gentleness</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>is also an attribute of Christ, by</p>
<p>which Paul had exhorted the Corinthians (2 Cor 10:1). </p>
<p>Paul connects these six attributes in a running stream sequence.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He begins with two attributes that are almost synonyms. Righteous-</p>
<p>ness and godliness both highlight being set apart from others, even in </p>
<p>the midst of being with others. Faith and love center on Christ Jesus, </p>
<p>whom one trusts and from whom one is strengthened. Perseverance and </p>
<p>gentleness are outward manifestations of the previous four attributes.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If Timothy is holy, godly, faithful, and loving, he will be more able to be </p>
<p>persevering or patient and humble with others around him, especially in </p>
<p>a climate of dissension and argument (e.g., 6:4–5).</p>
<p>Paul then rephrases this same point more urgently in the next two </p>
<p>sentences: Keep on ghting for yourself the good ght of the faith, </p>
<p>grasp for yourself eternal life, into which you were called and you con-</p>
<p>fessed the good confession before many witnesses (6:12). Paul uses two </p>
<p>parallel verbs signifying active participation to persevere as a Christian </p>
<p>(6:11): to ght and to grasp (6:12). Paul has used ght (agōnizomai) ear-</p>
<p>lier to describe how Paul and Timothy (and other believers) actively pre-</p>
<p>pare and contend for a prize from the merciful living Savior (4:10). Here </p>
<p>that prize is explicit: eternal life (6:12). Agōnizomai and agōn describe </p>
<p>63. See Titus 1:1; 2:12; 1 Tim 4:7–8.</p>
<p>64. 1 Tim 4:7–8; 6:6.</p>
<p>65. See 1 Tim 1:5, 14; 2 Tim 2:22.</p>
<p>66. Luke 8:15; 21:19.</p>
<p>67. Rom 5:3; 2 Cor 1:6.</p>
<p>68. See Titus 3:2; 2 Tim 2:25.</p>
<p>69. He uses asyndeton (“and” is omitted between a series of words, phrases, or </p>
<p>clauses) (Spencer 1998b: 188). Cf. 6:9 has polysyndeton.</p>
<p>70. Mounce (2000: 354) and Bernard (1922: 97) also arrange the virtues in three </p>
<p>groups. Lock (1924: 71) writes that righteousness, godliness, faith are virtues “towards </p>
<p>God,” while love, patience, gentleness are virtues “towards men.” </p>
