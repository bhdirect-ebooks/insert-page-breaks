<p>Fusing the Horizons: Signicance of Christ’s Birth42</p>
<p>did not come to give humans a heavy burden (cf. Matt 11:28–30), rather to </p>
<p>alleviate a great burden: to save sinners (1:15). He saved the great sinner </p>
<p>Paul who, in pursuit of what he thought was a just cause, violently persecut-</p>
<p>ed countless Christians and blasphemed the Lord Jesus. Another example </p>
<p>is the soldier Basilides. Potamiaena was a student of Origen in Alexandria, </p>
<p>Egypt in the 200s. She was beautiful but determined to remain a virgin </p>
<p>until she married, despite pressure from lovers. Because of her faith, she </p>
<p>was sentenced to death. A soldier, Basilides, led her away to her death. </p>
<p>People were making sexual jokes at Potamiaena’s expense but Basilides felt </p>
<p>compassion for her and treated her kindly. She thanked him and offered to </p>
<p>pray for him, even though he was bringing her to her death. Boiling pitch </p>
<p>was poured over her body, while Basilides watched. Afterwards, Basilides </p>
had to take an oath based on the divinity of Emperor Septimus Severus and
<p>to the shock of all his fellow-soldiers, he refused. Under no circumstances </p>
<p>would he take this oath because he was now a Christian. Basilides was </p>
<p>a persecutor of Christians but he received mercy from God, after having </p>
<p>received mercy from Potamiaena (Eusebius, Hist. eccl. 6.5).</p>
<p>Thus, Christmas should be a time of mercy. No one today is too violent </p>
<p>or evil or hopeless to receive God’s mercy and become transformed. God is </p>
<p>invisible (1:17). Nevertheless, Jesus can become visible again through peo-</p>
<p>ple today, like Paul and Basilides, who are transformed to serve. Christmas </p>
<p>should be a time in which to remember because Christ is merciful to us, </p>
<p>therefore we can be merciful to others, and even to ourselves, showing our </p>
<p>compassion in service to the extent that we are being strengthened by Christ </p>
<p>(1:12). </p>
<p>Keep Faith and a Good Conscience (1:18–20)</p>
<p>First Timothy 1:18–19 refers back to 1:5 as an internal summary of the </p>
<p>rst chapter:</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> is order I am entrusting to you, child Timothy, ac-</p>
<p>cording to the prophecies preceding you, that you may ght with </p>
<p>them the good ght, having faith and a good conscience, which some, </p>
<p>having rejected for themselves with respect to the faith, suered ship-</p>
<p>wreck, of which is Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to </p>
<p>139. “Order” (parangelia), “faith” (pistis), “conscience” (syneidēsis) all occur in 1:5 </p>
<p>and “child Timothy” in 1:2.</p>
