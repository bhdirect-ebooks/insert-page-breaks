<p>Introduction to 1 and 2 Timothy 19</p>
<p>A. Paul urges godly peaceful lives so that all may be saved and come</p>
<p>to knowledge of the truth (2:1–15).</p>
<p> B. Godly overseeing helps the church advance the truth (3:1–16).</p>
<p>III. Because God is Savior of all, Timothy should teach the words of the </p>
<p>faith, not heterodoxy, while making sure he himself sets an example of a </p>
<p>faithful believer (4:1—5:2).</p>
<p> A. Ascetic heterodoxy was predicted by the Spirit (4:1–5).</p>
<p>B. Since God is Savior of all people, a good minister is nourished by</p>
<p>the words of faith, refusing godless myths (4:6–10). </p>
<p>C. Timothy should become an example of a faithful believer as he</p>
<p>treats others, spiritually enriches himself, promoting his spiritual </p>
<p>gi, so that he will save himself and those who hear him (4:11—5:2).</p>
<p>IV. Church leaders should be honored and justly treated so that the church </p>
<p>is not open to attack (5:3—6:2).</p>
<p> A. True widows should be honored but younger widows should re-</p>
<p>marry so that the church may not be open to attack (5:3–16).</p>
<p>B. Elders leading well should be doubly honored and impartially</p>
<p>treated so good deeds will be evident (5:17–25).</p>
<p> C. Slaves should honor masters so God is not slandered (6:1–2).</p>
<p>V. Timothy should ght his own ght of the faith, eeing heterodox teaching </p>
<p>(6:3–21).</p>
<p>A. Heterodox teaching robs people of the truth, while piety with</p>
<p>contentment is its own means of gain (6:3–10).</p>
<p>B. Timothy instead should pursue righteousness, ghting the good</p>
<p>ght of the faith, guarding the commandment, not open to attack </p>
<p>until Jesus returns (6:11–16).</p>
<p> C. e rich should rely on God, not riches (6:17–19).</p>
<p>D. Timothy should guard the deposit, turning away from false</p>
<p>knowledge (6:20–21a).</p>
<p> E. Final greeting (6:21b).</p>
