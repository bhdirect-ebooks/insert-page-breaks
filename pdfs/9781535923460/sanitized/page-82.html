<p>While some agree women were probably “promulgating the heresy” and </p>
<p>authentein is a “dicult word to dene,” they conclude: “Paul does not </p>
<p>want women to be in positions of authority in the church; teaching is </p>
<p>one way in which authority is exercised in the church.” Women may not </p>
<p>“authoritatively teach the gospel to men (possibly overseers) in the public </p>
<p>assembly of the church.”</p>

<p>A. T. Robertson has raised a question many</p>
<p>137. Marshall 1999: 441, 442. Others have similar conclusions. Didaskein “forbids </p>
<p>women to teach a wrong doctrine.” Paul does not allow a woman “to proclaim herself </p>
<p>author of man,” going back to the sense of authentēs as the responsibility of the subject </p>
<p>in the accomplishment of an act or function (Kroeger 1992: 81, 99, 103, 185, 192). Au-</p>
<p>thentein has the connotation “to domineer.” Some kind of “disruptive behavior, which </p>
<p>perhaps included boisterous armation of the heresies, seems to lie behind these in-</p>
<p>structions” (Fee 1988: 73). See also REB: “I do not permit women to teach or dictate to </p>
<p>the men” and CEV: “ey should be silent and not be allowed to teach or to tell men </p>
<p>what to do” (2:12). e second verb (authenteō) modies the rst verb (didaskō), simi-</p>
<p>lar in function to a pleonasm or hendiadys: I am not permitting a woman to teach with </p>
<p>self-assumed authority over a man. In other words, the connecting oude combines </p>
<p>two conceptually dierent elements to express a single idea (Payne 2009: 337–59). </p>
<p>See also TNIV: “I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man” </p>
<p>(2:12). e footnote has “Or teach a man in a domineering way.” “Paul is addressing </p>
<p>women who have been involved in teaching the heresy” or have assumed the teach-</p>
<p>ing role inappropriately “out of a desire to dominate in the public meeting” (Towner </p>
<p>2006: 223–24). “Paul may here be warning against a domineering use of authority, </p>
<p>rather than merely any use of authority” (Keener 1992: 109). Authenteō is not “gender-</p>
<p>specic,” as John Chrysostom advises husbands not to “be despotic or domineer the </p>
<p>woman” (Hom. 10 Col.). e verb “characterizes the nature of the teaching rather than </p>
<p>the role of women in church leadership in general” (Witherington 2006: 227–28). “It </p>
<p>is inconsistent to regard the dress code in 1 Timothy 2:9 as culturally relative and, </p>
<p>therefore, temporary, but the restriction on women’s ministry in 2:12 as universal and </p>
<p>permanent. All these instructions are part of the same paragraph, the same ow of </p>
<p>thought” (Groothuis 1997: 214). “ere is no rst-century warrant for translating au-</p>
<p>thentein as ‘to exercise authority’ ... Rather the sense is the Koine ‘to dominate, to get </p>
<p>one’s way.’” “To dene a purpose or goal actually provides a good t: ‘I do not permit a </p>
<p>woman to teach so as to gain mastery over a man,’ or ‘I do not permit a woman to teach </p>
<p>with a view to dominating a man’” (Belleville 2005: 216, 219). </p>
<p>138. Mounce 2000: 120, 126, 130. Others have similar conclusions: Paul “prohib-</p>
<p>ited wives from teaching their husbands in public worship” and “to have authority </p>
<p>over their husbands in that same context” (Gritz 1991: 135). Women are “debarred </p>
<p>from occupying whatever position in a given local church would be equivalent to the </p>
<p>pastoral epistles’ governing elder” (Moo 1991: 186–87). A woman by nature is “formed </p>
<p>to obey,” for the government of women has always been regarded by all wise persons </p>
<p>as a “monstrous thing; and, therefore, so to speak, it will be a mingling of heaven and </p>
<p>earth, if women usurp the right to teach. Accordingly, he bids them be ‘quiet,’ that </p>
<p>is, keep within their own rank” (Calvin n.d.: 2178). “Virtually every word in verses </p>
<p>11–12 is disputed.” “e debate over the meaning of authentein has been vigorous. </p>
