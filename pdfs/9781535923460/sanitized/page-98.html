<p>1 Timothy 2–382</p>
<p>a household slave: “When a wife’s looks outshine a maid’s, and she is </p>
<p>fresher and more becomingly dressed, they’re a ravishing sight, especially </p>
<p>when the wife is also willing to oblige, whereas the girl’s services are com-</p>
<p>pulsory” (Oec. 10.12). Demosthenes explains: “Mistresses (hetaira) we </p>
<p>keep for the sake of pleasure, concubines for the daily care of our persons, </p>
<p>but wives to bear us legitimate</p>
<p>212</p>
<p>children and to be faithful guardians of</p>
<p>our households” (Neaer. 122). Hetairai were “women, slave or free, who </p>
<p>traded their sexual favours for long or short periods outside wedlock.”</p>
<p>213</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ey could be streetwalkers or accomplished courtesans. Adolf Berger </p>
<p>and Barry Nicholas explain: Roman law “took cognizance only of adul-</p>
<p>tery by the wife .. . Adultery by the husband was never as such a crime, </p>
<p>but his illicit intercourse with a respectable woman constituted the crime </p>
<p>of stuprum under the Lex Julia, and in the h century (Cod. Just.5.17.8) </p>
<p>his adultery in the matrimonial home or his adultery with a married </p>
woman anywhere entitled his wife to divorce him.”
<p>214</p>
<p> If a man were faith-</p>
<p>ful and devoted and focused only on his wife, he would have no room in </p>
<p>his heart or in his time for other intimate female (or male) relationships.</p>
<p>Having a wife and a mistress would be similar in reality to polyga-</p>
<p>my.</p>
<p>215</p>
<p>Although Greeks and Romans espoused monogamy, in practice a</p>
<p>man might have more than one regular sexual relationship. Paul’s direc-</p>
<p>tive would also contrast with legal polygamy (as expressed in the transla-</p>
<p>tion “have only one wife”). Polygamy was possible with Jews, even though </p>
<p>monogamy was preferred and more common. For example, King Herod </p>
<p>had nine wives.</p>
<p>216</p>
<p>e Mishnah readily discusses the rights of “co-wives,”</p>
<p>and a man being married to two or three or four wives.</p>
<p>217</p>
<p>A man could</p>
<p>212. “Legitimate” (gnēsiōs) is the same term used for Timothy and Titus by Paul (1 </p>
<p>Tim 1:2; Titus 1:4).</p>
<p>213. OCD, 512.</p>
<p>214. OCD, 10–11.</p>
<p>215. Tertullian concludes that “none but monogamists are to be chosen for the or-</p>
<p>der of the priesthood.” He adds that men have been “deposed from oce for digamy,” </p>
<p>Exh.cast. 7. In contrast, Ngewa (2009: 62) uses “a one-woman man” to allow polygamy </p>
<p>among African ocers whose behavior is “chaste and mature.” But, are not they then </p>
<p>“two-women men”?</p>
<p>216. Ilan 1995: 85–88. See also Josephus, Ant. 17.1 [14]. Justin Martyr describes </p>
<p>Jewish men as taking as many wives as they desired (Dial. 134, 141).</p>
<p>217. E.g., m. Yebam. 1:1–4; 16:1; m. Ketub. 10:1–2, 4–6.</p>
