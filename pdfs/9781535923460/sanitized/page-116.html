<p>1 Timothy 2–3100</p>
<p>e other proclamations about the godly mystery (3:16) have been </p>
<p>presented in chronological order: incarnation, righteous life, resurrec-</p>
<p>tion, proclamation, and response. e ascension occurred aer the resur-</p>
<p>rection but before the proclamation. Why hold it until the end? Possibly, </p>
<p>Paul concludes the confession with the ascension because thereby he </p>
<p>highlights the positive conclusion of the confession (beginning with the </p>
<p>incarnation, ending with glory) and in glory also alludes to Jesus’ present </p>
<p>position of authority and future return in glory.</p>
<p>318</p>
<p>Glory (doxa) reminds</p>
<p>the reader of the glorious nature of the whole gospel and the glorious </p>
<p>nature of the triune God.</p>

<p>Fusing the Horizons: How to Use Leadership Lists</p>
<p>Much effort is spent on applying 1 Timothy 3:2–13 as a checklist from </p>
<p>which to remove potential candidates for leadership. But instead it should </p>
<p>be used as a guide to help Christians mature. We should all aspire to matu-</p>
<p>rity, which also would make us good candidates for the teaching and ruling </p>
<p>ministries. Do we live so that people do not have a justiﬁed reason to attack </p>
<p>us? If married, are we focused totally on our spouse, rejoicing in him or her? </p>
<p>Are we striving for self-control in all areas of our life, in moderating the use </p>
<p>of wine or alcohol, in not being ruled by our sensual desires, in disciplining </p>
<p>our use of and attitude toward money? Are we treating with kindness both </p>
<p>strangers and members of our family? Are we working on how to teach oth-</p>
<p>ers, being gentle and peaceable with them as opposed to slandering them </p>
<p>or jumping swiftly to disagree? Are we trying to be wise and more mature </p>
<p>in the faith? These are the characteristics that will help us lead others. A. </p>
<p>J. Gordon in How Christ Came to Church exhorts his listeners to be used by </p>
<p>the Spirit: </p>
<p>As the wind pours through the organ pipes, causing their voice to be </p>
<p>heard, albeit according to the distinctive tone and pitch of each, so </p>
<p>the Spirit speaks through each minister of Christ according to his </p>
<p>special gift, that the people may hear the word of the Lord. Is it not </p>
<p>the most subtle temptation which comes to the preacher that he allow </p>
<p>himself to be played upon by some other spirit than the Paraclete? </p>
<p>318. See Titus 2:13; 1 Cor 15:42–43. Kelly concludes that the phrase implies that </p>
Christ ascended and “has been taken up into the realm of the divine glory, there to
<p>reign with the Father” (1963: 92).</p>
<p>319. Glory is an important theme in the Pastorals. See 1 Tim 1:11, 17; 2 Tim 4:18. </p>
