<p>1 Timothy 2–360</p>
<p>who learn will teach, as Hebrews explains: “For though by this time </p>
<p>you ought to be teachers, again you need someone to teach you the rst </p>
<p>principles of God’s words” (Heb 5:12). e rabbis also taught that a good </p>
<p>learner “learns in order to teach and ... learns in order to practice” (m. </p>
<p>‘Abot 6:6). Not all Christians will have the spiritual gi of teaching sys-</p>
<p>tematically, yet they should pass on to others what they have learned.</p>

<p>erefore, de (but), introducing 2:12, is most likely adversative but, to </p>
<p>teach, a woman, I am not permitting, certainly not</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>to domineer over</p>
<p>a man, but to be in silence (2:12). Women at Ephesus are to learn, but </p>
<p>not to teach. Paul highlights to teach by placing the innitive rst in the </p>
<p>sentence instead of the usual Greek word order: I am not permitting </p>
<p>(subject and its verb) for a woman (object) to teach (object of verb).</p>

<p>Teaching is an important theme in the Pastoral Letters. In almost </p>
<p>every case, its usage in the Pastorals is greater than expected from their </p>
<p>length relative to the whole New Testament. e references to didaskalia </p>

<p>98. When oude joins two prohibited actions, the second action can intensify the </p>
<p>rst one, as in 1 Tim 6:16; Rom 8:7: 11:21. Oude may then be translated “certainly not,” </p>
<p>“moreover,” “especially not.” In summary, Paul does not allow women to continue this </p>
<p>teaching destructive to men, even as Eve’s teaching was destructive to Adam.</p>

<p>23.45% of the N.T. “Paul’s letters” are all letters ascribed to Paul. Length is determined </p>
<p>by number of Greek pages.</p>
