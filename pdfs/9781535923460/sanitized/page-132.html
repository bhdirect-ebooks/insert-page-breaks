<p>1 Timothy 4:1—5:2116</p>
<p>4:13 and 6:2, it is distinguished from teaching,</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>although it is closely</p>
<p>related to it. </p>
<p>Paul continues with another illustration of how to become an ex-</p>
<p>ample to others: Do not neglect the spiritual gi in you, which was </p>
<p>given to you through prophecy accompanied by laying on of hands of </p>
<p>the council of elders (4:14). Most likely the council of elders prayed for </p>
<p>Timothy to receive a spiritual gi (charisma) which (in his case) was the </p>
<p>gi of evangelism (2 Tim 4:5). An evangelist, a minister of the word (Eph </p>
<p>4:11–12), was a messenger of God’s good news of salvation who would </p>
<p>preach, baptize, and instruct people in the basics of faith. e only other </p>
<p>person called an evangelist was Philip.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>In Acts we rst see Timothy</p>
<p>evangelizing as part of Paul’s team of coworkers who join him as they </p>
<p>fulll God’s vision to reach Macedonia.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>Charisma has the same root</p>
<p>as charis (“joy”).</p>
<p>103</p>
<p> God as one who gives joy and delights in his chil-</p>
<p>dren gives proofs or benets of God’s joy. ese gis give joy to others by </p>
<p>strengthening them. ey are given through the triune God to benet the </p>
<p>body.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>Although two other spiritual gis have been mentioned in 4:13</p>
<p>(encouragement [Rom 12:8] and teaching [1 Cor 12:28–29]), evangelism </p>
<p>is Timothy’s special gi. Every Christian may do some aspect of every </p>
<p>spiritual gi, but he/she will be especially gied in one or two areas. For </p>
<p>instance, although Paul certainly proclaimed the good news,</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>he calls</p>
<p>himself an “apostle” and “teacher” as well as “preacher” (1 Tim 2:7), but </p>
<p>not an “evangelist.” erefore, he usually did not baptize people (1 Cor </p>
<p>1:14–17), as an evangelist would. In both 1 Timothy 4:14 and 2 Timo-</p>
<p>thy 1:6 charisma are mentioned and the laying on of hands.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>In 4:14,</p>
<p>100. See 1 Tim 4:11.</p>
<p>101. Acts 6:5; 8:4–12; 21:8.</p>
<p>102. Paul, Timothy, Luke, Silas (Acts 15:40–16:1, 9–10). In the N.T., the commis-</p>
<p>sion to preach good news goes back to the angel Gabriel sent by God, Jesus, and the </p>
<p>Twelve (Luke 1:19; 4:18; 9:1–6; 20:1).</p>
<p>103. ayer, 665, 667.</p>
<p>104. 1 Cor 12:4–11; Eph 4:7–12; 2 Tim 1:6; 1 Pet 4:10–11.</p>
<p>105. Acts 20:24; Rom 15:20; 1 Cor 15:1; 2 Cor 11:7.</p>
<p>106. Timothy himself would be laying his hands on others, but he is not to do so </p>
<p>hastily (1 Tim 5:22). Laying on of hands was also a symbolic act during occasions for </p>
<p>healing (Matt 9:18, 25; Mark 6:5; 7:32; 8:23, 25; Luke 4:40; 13:13; Acts 9:12, 17; 28:8), </p>
<p>for blessing (Matt 19:13–15; Mark 10:16; Deut 34:9), and for asking for the indwelling </p>
<p>Holy Spirit (Acts 8:17–19; 19:6, 17), but it was never magic. See Spencer 1985: 97–98. </p>
<p>In the O.T., the people laid their hands on the Levites as a symbol of their being set </p>
<p>aside to represent the people (Num 8:10–13). See also Irwin 2008: 125.</p>
