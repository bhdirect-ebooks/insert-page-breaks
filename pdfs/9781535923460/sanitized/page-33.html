<p>Artemis could use her arrows to protect, but also to attack.</p>
<p>One etymology for her name was “slaughterer, butcher.”</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>Artemis could</p>
<p>protect mothers and kill them.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> In festivals for Artemis, to keep Arte-</p>
<p>mis from slaughtering the participants, “one must hold to a man’s throat </p>
<p>the sword, and spill the blood for hallowing and the Goddess’ honour’s </p>
<p>s a ke.”</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> Artemis’s tales were not that dierent from legends about Ama-</p>
<p>zon warriors who were required to slay a male enemy before they could </p>
<p>marry.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>Artemis was associated with ritual murder and there is evidence</p>
<p>that human sacrice was still practiced in the rst century.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> e festi-</p>
<p>val of Artemis, like those of the Amazons, armed orgiastic religious </p>
<p>practices.</p>

<p>When women went o to celebrate their festivals, they might</p>
<p>“spend whole nights on the bare hills in dances which stimulated ecstasy, </p>
<p>and in an intoxication perhaps partly alcoholic, but mainly mystical.”</p>

<p>Ephesus was well known as a center for the study and practice of </p>
<p>magic. Artemis at Ephesus was related to magic, the use of techniques to </p>
<p>assure human control or power over supernatural forces.</p>

<p>35. In Euripides’ tales, rst the angry Artemis demands the sacrice of the maiden </p>
<p>Iphigeneia, daughter of Agamemon, to appease herself (Iph. aul., 89–93) and then </p>
<p>snatches her from the altar to make her priestess of her temple in Taurica, north of the </p>
<p>Black Sea. Whenever any Greek men came to that coast, they were seized and sacri-</p>
<p>ced. Iphigeneia was forced to consecrate them to Artemis for death on the altar. “I </p>
<p>consecrate the victim,” Iphigeneia laments “in rites of that dark cult wherein Artemis </p>
<p>joys,--fair is its name alone.” While Artemis barred murderers from her altars, she “yet </p>
<p>joys herself in human sacrice!” (Euripides, Iph. taur., 35, 40, 381–84). Clement of </p>
<p>Alexandria refers to these sacrices (Protr., ch. 3.).</p>

<p>to the goddess, could be a frenzied and bloody rite (omas 1995: 91).</p>

<p>heavy drinking (omas 1995: 110), though not all aspects of the festivals were un-</p>
<p>wholesome. See Murphy-O’Connor 2008: 63, 175, 177, 199; Trebilco 1994: 321–22; </p>
