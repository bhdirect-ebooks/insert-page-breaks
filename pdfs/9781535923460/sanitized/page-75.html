<p>Godly Peaceful Lives (2:1–15) 59</p>
<p>positive connotations for silence, for example, “ose who have knowl-</p>
<p>edge use words with restraint ... Even fools are thought wise if they keep </p>
<p>silent, and discerning if they hold their tongues” (Prov 17:27–28 TNIV). </p>
<p>Hēsychios (adjective), hēsychia (noun), and hēsychazō (verb) in the New </p>
<p>Testament always have positive connotations. Hēsychios has positive con-</p>
<p>notations in 1 Timothy 2:2 when all Christians are encouraged to lead </p>
<p>a “quiet” life,</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>a life free from persecution by rulers. In an educational</p>
<p>setting, it refers to the state of calm, restraint at the proper time, respect, </p>
<p>and armation of a speaker. It does not necessarily refer to not speaking. </p>
<p>When the circumcision party heard from Peter how the Lord had saved </p>
<p>Cornelius and his household, “they were silenced and praised God saying: </p>
<p>‘en also to the Gentiles God gave repentance that leads to life’” (Acts </p>
<p>11:17–18). us, the rst act they did aer they “were silent” was speak!</p>
<p>is hesychia word family may be found especially in the Old and </p>
<p>New Testaments to refer, literally, to rest, not work, and especially not </p>
<p>ght.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>“Not ghting” also aects the way people interact when verbally</p>
<p>communicating. us, the word family can refer to the silence when </p>
<p>someone is not able to answer a challenging question or someone ac-</p>
<p>quiesces to another’s arguments or someone is won over by another’s ar-</p>
<p>guments.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>“Stillness” is a proactive inner quality that can withstand the</p>
<p>temptation of sin (Gen 4:7) and pursue good, rather than evil.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>e Lord</p>
<p>honors the person who is “lowly and still and (who) trembles at (his) </p>
<p>words” (Isa 66:2). Many of these elements of “quiet” could be important </p>
<p>to the female students: learning, especially by study, of God’s new cov-</p>
<p>enant, not by means of ghting nor by openness to evil, but with humility </p>
<p>and cooperation (hypotagē).</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>What enabled Paul to make such a radical command? Because he </p>
<p>followed the example of rabbi Jesus who had insisted that his disciple </p>
<p>Mary learn even though a woman’s primary ancient responsibility was </p>
<p>homemaking (Luke 10:40–42).</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>Learning (manthanō) and teaching (dida<span class="_ _3" />skō)<span class="ff2"> <span class="_ _8"> </span></span>are interrelated ac-</p>
<p>tions (2:11–12). Aer all, teaching is learned (Rom 16:17). And, those </p>
