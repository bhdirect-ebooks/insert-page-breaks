<p>1 Timothy 5:3—6:2128</p>
<p>“stands rm in his resolve, being under no necessity but having his own </p>
<p>desire under control, and has determined in his own mind” to be single </p>
<p>(1 Cor 7:37 NRSV). is four part set of conditions was not always ad-</p>
<p>hered to when a young widow committed herself not to remarry. A subtle </p>
<p>discussion of the benets of being single in order to promote the Lord’s </p>
<p>aairs in a time of distress (1 Cor 7:26–34) was turned at Ephesus into </p>
<p>always forbidding marriage (1 Tim 4:3). </p>
<p>A Greek or Roman woman might also think of the model of Arte-</p>
<p>mis, renowned as the virgin goddess, liing high the state of being single, </p>
<p>but not necessarily of chastity. Sarah Pomeroy explains that Artemis and </p>
<p>Athena “had never submitted to a monogamous marriage. Rather, as </p>
<p>bets mother goddesses, they had enjoyed many consorts.”</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>e Vestal</p>
<p>Virgins in Rome, who tended the perpetual re to Vesta, guardian of </p>
<p>the hearth, were “the most severely disciplined, the most privileged, and </p>
<p>the most highly honoured among Roman women.”</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>ese women who</p>
<p>vowed to be virgins for thirty years were even exempt from the power of </p>
<p>the pater familias. In the Greek pantheon, the most liberated goddesses </p>
<p>were those not bound to male gods in a permanent relationship.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>widows of the church, although they had restrictions, also were “freed </p>
<p>from the hierarchical dominance of either father or husband, freed from </p>
<p>the demands of childbearing and rearing, freed even from pressing eco-</p>
<p>nomic concerns.”</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>To restrict such enticements, Paul proposes four evidences of good </p>
<p>actions (good works, 5:10)</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>toward her household, toward outsiders,</p>
<p>toward the church, and toward society. Teknotropheō (5:10) (to bring up </p>
<p>children) is the combination of teknon “child” and trephō (to nourish, </p>
<p>attire, and nurse).</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>It includes providing for the physical and educational</p>
<p>necessities for a child to mature. Children are a repeating theme in 1 </p>
<p>Timothy. First, Paul calls Timothy his genuine child (teknon, 1:2, 18). </p>
<p>en, e childbirth (teknogonia) is the means for salvation (2:15). e </p>
<p>treatment of one’s own children becomes important as a helpful quality </p>
<p>for leadership (3:4, 12). In chapter 5, the responsibility for children to </p>
