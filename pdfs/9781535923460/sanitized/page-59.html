<p>Keep Faith and a Good Conscience (1:18–20) 43</p>
<p>Satan, that they might learn not to slander (1:18–20). Paul is entrusting </p>
<p>to Timothy an order of “love from a clean heart and a good conscience </p>
<p>and a genuine faith” (1:5). is love has been demonstrated and made </p>
<p>possible by Christ Jesus who “came into the world to save sinners” (1:15). </p>
<p>erefore, Timothy has been charged to exhort certain people at Ephe-</p>
<p>sus “not to teach a dierent doctrine and not to occupy themselves with </p>
<p>myths and endless genealogies” (1:3–4) nor to misuse the law (1:8). </p>
<p>Timothy had been well spoken of by the believers in Lystra and </p>
<p>Iconium (Acts 16:2). Possibly, some believers had prophesied then about </p>
<p>Timothy. Timothy’s spiritual gi had been given to him when the elders </p>
<p>laid hands on him (1 Tim 4:14). at is why Paul entrusted this com-</p>
<p>mission to Timothy. As an evangelist (2 Tim 4:5), Timothy is particu-</p>
<p>larly gied to respond to heterodox teachers. But, as well, the Holy Spirit </p>
<p>had prophesied about future false teachings at Ephesus (1 Tim 4:1; Acts </p>
<p>20:29–30). Because Timothy knew, from prophecy (1:18), that the teach-</p>
<p>ings at Ephesus were indeed heterodox, he does not have to be unsure </p>
<p>about their truth or falsehood. erefore, he can ght this campaign with </p>
<p>condence. Prophecy reproves and calls all to account (1 Cor 14:22–25). </p>
<p>e words of prophets should not be despised, because prophets are </p>
<p>moved by the Holy Spirit (1 ess 5:19–20; 2 Pet 1:21). Some prophets, </p>
<p>for example, had been moved by the Holy Spirit to forewarn Christians </p>
<p>about the future heterodox teaching at Ephesus. </p>
<p>is order of ministry is now explained in the imagery for a sol-</p>
<p>dier waging war: ght ... the good ght (strateuō, strateia, 1:18).</p>

<p>3:14). e Roman Emperor Augustus established a permanent standing </p>
<p>army, composed of Roman citizens and auxilia (soldiers raised from the </p>
<p>provinces). e military had praefecti (commanders) or tribunes, under </p>
<p>which were centurions and decurions and then soldiers.</p>

<p>Corinthians (2 Cor 10:3–4), a city overrun with military personnel, situated under the </p>
