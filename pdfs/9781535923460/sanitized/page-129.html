<p>Timothy Should Become an Example (4:11—5:2) 113</p>
<p>to hold a negative opinion, look down on, be opinionated against.</p>

<p>e</p>
<p>cause (your youth)</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>of the negative opinion is emphasized by being</p>
<p>placed before the verb (despise). Timothy may have been twenty-seven </p>
<p>at this time.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>According to the Mishnah, twenty was the age to pursue a</p>
<p>calling and thirty for authority (m. ‘Abot 5:21). Neotēs refers especially to </p>
<p>youth of a “military or athletic age,”</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>which ts well with the previous</p>
<p>athletic images (1:18; 4:7–8, 10). e manner of responding to negative </p>
<p>opinions of his youth was not by speech (reprimanding such views) but </p>
<p>by example. A typos was a pattern or model “in conformity to which a </p>
<p>thing must be made,” an archetype.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>Paul had already referred to himself</p>
<p>as an “example” or prototype (hypotypōsis)</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> of a sinner saved from pun-</p>
<p>ishment by Christ Jesus showing compassion toward him by forgiving </p>
<p>him. Paul has used Timothy as a model in other letters: with himself, </p>
<p>of believers who persevere despite suering and who work.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>Paul had</p>
<p>sent Timothy to Corinth as a model of someone who shares in Christ’s </p>
<p>suerings.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>Even as an adolescent, Timothy saw Paul in his hometown of</p>
<p>Lystra not only heal the sick but also be stoned and dragged outside the </p>
<p>city by those supposing him to be dead. Probably Timothy, Eunice, and </p>
<p>other disciples gathered around the “dead” Paul. What a profound ex-</p>
<p>ample of the persecution Christians could receive as a result of believing </p>
<p>in the crucied Messiah!</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>And yet, Timothy agreed to accompany Paul</p>
<p>and Silas in ministry when they later returned to Lystra (Acts 16:1–3). </p>
<p>Both Timothy and Titus were to be “models” (example, 4:12). Timo-</p>
<p>thy was to be a model for all believers, rst in orthodoxy (right doctrine), </p>
<p>then conduct.</p>
