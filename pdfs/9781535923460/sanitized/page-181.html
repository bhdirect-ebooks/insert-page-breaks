<p>succeed” or “Some of them perished miserably, others saved themselves </p>
<p>disgracefully.” Aristotle explains that “this kind of style is pleasing” (Rhet. </p>
<p>3.9.7–9). ere is nothing inherently wrong with antithesis or knowledge, </p>
<p>however, what was at Ephesus was false, not real, true knowledge.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>But,</p>
<p>possibly antithesis indicates some of the appeal of the false teachers who </p>
<p>were playing with words that engage the mind but do not lead to truth. </p>
<p>ose who profess this content, declaring themselves adherents who will </p>
<p>carry it out, miss the mark (astocheō). eir aim is bad or amiss.</p>

<p>sibly, the mark could refer to the goal (skopos) or post toward which a </p>

<p>“love from a clean heart and a good conscience and a genuine faith” (1:5).</p>
<p>Paul closes his letter with his brief farewell.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>He uses the plural you</p>
<p>(6:21), which shows that, although he writes to Timothy (1:2), he does </p>
<p>so in the context of the whole church.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>Paul ends his letters frequently</p>
<p>referring to grace.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>In this letter, it is a reminder of the grace of the Lord</p>
<p>that overowed with faith and love in Paul’s own life resulting in his own </p>
<p>grace or thankfulness (1:12, 14). erefore, Paul prays that Timothy and </p>
<p>the church “experience God’s gracious presence among them.”</p>
