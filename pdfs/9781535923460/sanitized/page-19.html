<p>Introduction to Pastoral Letters 3</p>
<p>real Paul? Is Paul the person driven with zeal to serve Jesus the Messiah, </p>
<p>his life being on the line every day? Is he forgiving and merciful? Has he </p>
<p>rejected his rabbinic past, relying on the Spirit, living each day open to </p>
<p>the paradoxes of life? Or, is the author of the Pastorals a condemning </p>
<p>man, full of fears, a hierarchically conservative man who wants every-</p>
<p>thing and everyone in its order and place? Instead of rejecting his past, </p>
<p>has he accepted fully his conservative traditions as he aims to appease his </p>
<p>environment? As Dornier concludes: “e style of the moralist has taken </p>
<p>the place of the style of the prophet.”</p>

<p>Although authorship has to be decided on external evidence, not </p>
<p>subjective criteria, the Paul we meet in the Pastorals is still very much </p>
<p>aware of the irreproachableness of his own past. In Titus and 1 Timothy, </p>
<p>he has been released from prison and wants to make sure no believer </p>
<p>is apprehended for the wrong reasons. He wants people to enjoy God’s </p>
<p>creation and not be ascetic—to marry, to eat. Although truth is crucial, it </p>
<p>is so because of the health it brings. e God Paul highlights is a merciful </p>
<p>God, Savior, hope of the world, and forgiving. God is savior before he is </p>
<p>judge.</p>
<p>We have extensive external evidence supporting Paul as the author. </p>
<p>e Muratorian Canon (A.D. 170–80) says that Paul addressed seven </p>
<p>churches by name: Corinthians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Ga-</p>
latians, essalonians, and Romans, and he wrote four letters to individ-
<p>uals: Philemon, Titus, two to Timothy, written from “personal aection” </p>
<p>but “held sacred in the esteem of the church catholic for the regulation of </p>
<p>ecclesiastical discipline.” e Canon adds that forged letters should not be </p>
<p>received with the genuine ones, because “it is not tting that gall be mixed </p>
<p>with honey.”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Papyrus 32 (A.D. 175–200), an Alexandrian text, includes</p>
<p>Titus 1:11–15 and 2:3–8. Eusebius (260–339) states that the Epistles of </p>
<p>Paul are universally “recognized” as true and genuine, while books “put </p>
<p>forward by heretics under the name of the apostles” . . . “must be shunned </p>
<p>as altogether wicked and impious” (Hist. eccl. 3.25). </p>
<p>Allusions to, and quotations of, the Pastoral Letters start early. Clem-</p>
<p>ent of Rome’s Letter to the Corinthians (c. 95) alludes to 1 Timothy 1:17 </p>
<p>(61:2) and Titus 3:1 (2:7; 33:1; 34:4). e Letter of Ignatius to the Magne-</p>
<p>sians (8:1) alludes to 1 Timothy 1:4 and Titus 3:9. Polycarp (71–155), the </p>
<p>Bishop of Smyrna, alludes to 1 Timothy 3:8; 5:5; 6:7, 10; and 2 Timothy </p>
<p>4. In Hanson 1982: 3–4.</p>
<p>5. e early church did not accept pseudonymous writings as authoritative. See </p>
<p>also Lea 1991: 535–59; Westcott 1896: 438, 441, 453, 455–56, 565; Harris 1969: 253.</p>
