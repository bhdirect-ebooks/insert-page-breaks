<p>e Apostle Paul, Once Unrighteous, ReceivedMercy(1:12–17) 35</p>
<p>me, Christ Jesus our Lord, that he considered me faithful, having ap-</p>
<p>pointed me into ministry, formerly being a blasphemer and a persecu-</p>
<p>tor and a violent person, but I received mercy since being ignorant I </p>
<p>acted in unbelief (1:12–13).</p>
<p>e Lord’s grace toward Paul (1:14) resulted in Paul’s grace (grati-</p>
<p>tude) toward the Lord (1:12). Grace is like a circular owing airstream. </p>
<p>Paul is similar to the thankful healed Samaritan leper who remembered </p>
<p>to thank Jesus (Luke 17:15–19). e leper was healed and saved, and </p>
<p>Paul was saved and strengthened (endynamoō, 1:12) and continues to </p>
<p>be strengthened. In the Old Testament endynamoō is used to describe </p>
<p>the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>Paul too is being indwelt by the Holy</p>
<p>Spirit</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> by means of Christ Jesus, in order to become eective in min-</p>
<p>istry.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>e Lord appointed Paul soon aer Paul’s rst encounter with</p>
<p>Jesus while going to Damascus: “to bear my name before Gentiles and </p>
<p>also rulers and people of Israel.”</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>When Paul was rst converted from</p>
<p>persecuting Jesus and Jesus’ disciples to preaching that Jesus is the Son </p>
<p>of God, he became more and more “eective” in proving that Jesus was </p>
<p>the prophesied Messiah, as the Lord “empowered” Paul to preach (2 Tim </p>
<p>4:17).</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul describes his former self with three negative attributes: a </p>
<p>blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent person (1:13). ese three </p>
<p>words are related because blasphemers and persecutors can be violent. </p>
<p>Blasphemy has two basic types: against God and against humans.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Blasphemy against God can include claiming to be God</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>or saying or</p>
<p>doing things only God can do (like forgive sins, Matt 9:2–3) and dishon-</p>
<p>oring and speaking against God.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>Blasphemy against humans includes</p>
<p>insulting them</p>
<p>104</p>
<p> and speaking untruths about them.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>Paul probably</p>
<p>96. Judg 6:34; 1 Chr 12:18.</p>
<p>97. See also Acts 9:17.</p>
<p>98. In contrast, in Phil 4:11–13, Paul is empowered to be content in all situations, </p>
<p>which can include ministry but is not limited to it.</p>
<p>99. Acts 9:15; Rom 1:5, 16; Gal 2:7–8.</p>
<p>100. Acts 9:1–5, 20–22.</p>
<p>101. E.g., Stephen’s accusation, Acts 6:11. See also Titus 2:5.</p>
<p>102. John 10:33; Matt 26:64–65.</p>
<p>103. Rom 2:24; 14:16; 1 Tim 6:1; Titus 2:5; Jas 2:7; Rev 13:1, 5–6.</p>
<p>104. Matt 27:39; Acts 13:45; 1 Pet 4:4.</p>
<p>105. Rom 3:8; 1 Cor 10:30; Titus 3:2; 2 Pet 2:2, 12.</p>
