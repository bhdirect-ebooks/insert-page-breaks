<p>Introduction to Pastoral Letters 9</p>
<p>Corinthians should not accept any dierent gospel. Moreover, the oces </p>
<p>in the Pastorals are not so clear. Even Marxsen writes: it is “dicult to </p>
<p>determine the relationship between them. We certainly cannot speak of </p>
<p>a three-fold hierarchy, for bishop and deacons ... are never mentioned </p>
<p>along with the elders.”</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>In Philippians 1:1, bishops and deacons are</p>
<p>mentioned together, whereas in Ignatius’ letters the bishop already has </p>
<p>clear power over the deacon. In Ignatius to the Magnesians, the deacon </p>
<p>is “subject to the bishop” and to the presbytery, and the bishop presides </p>
<p>in the place of God (the Father) while the presbyters are in the place of </p>
<p>the council of the apostles and the deacons in the place of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By the time of the Apostolic Constitutions (A.D. 380, also from Syria), </p>
<p>the bishop, presbyter, deacon, deaconess, widows, virgins, women elders, </p>
<p>and older and younger women are seated in order (2.7).</p>
<p>eological Reasons</p>
<p>Some scholars complain that the Pastorals must be late because Jesus is </p>
<p>clearly called God in Titus 2:13, the “Son” is never used for Christ, and </p>
<p>the Holy Spirit is not mentioned.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>e Pastorals have more emphasis on</p>
<p>works. ere is no mention of the cross, the law seems misunderstood (1 </p>
<p>Tim 1:8), grace appears an exterior aid, not an interior presence, and faith </p>
<p>has a content. Love is one virtue among many. ere is an emphasis on </p>
<p>civil “bourgeois” virtues—temperance, common sense, seriousness, in-</p>
<p>tegrity about money, delity, and respectability. In contrast, some schol-</p>
<p>ars contend, Paul would have said “pride” is the root of all evil (Rom 7). </p>
<p>“Mystery” becomes the Christian faith as a whole, not the saving action </p>
<p>of God in Christ. Baptism appears to be a method of salvation (Titus 3:5). </p>
<p>e heresy confronted seems similar to the Gnosticism of the second </p>
<p>century, like Ignatius’ Gnosticism, for example, where “suering is only </p>
<p>a semblance.”</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>But how compelling are such objections? Even in Philippians 2:6, </p>
<p>Jesus is in the “form” of God, while the “Son” is not used in the Letter to </p>
<p>the Philippians. Further, the Spirit is, certainly, mentioned in the Pasto-</p>
<p>rals: vindication in the Spirit, the Spirit says, guarded by the Holy Spirit, </p>
