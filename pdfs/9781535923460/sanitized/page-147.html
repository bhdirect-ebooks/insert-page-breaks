<p>True Widows and Younger Widows (5:3–16) 131</p>
<p>should vow and not fulll it. Do not let your mouth lead you into sin” </p>
<p>(Eccl 5:5–6a NRSV) and “If you make a vow to the Lord your God, do not </p>
<p>postpone fullling it; for the Lord your God will surely require it of you, </p>
<p>and you would incur guilt” (Deut 23:21 NRSV). In the law, “every vow of </p>
a widow or of a divorced woman, by which she has bound herself, shall
<p>be binding upon her” (Num 30:9 NRSV). Paul himself claims he does not </p>
<p>make his plans in a “eshly” or “worldly” manner, “in the same breath” </p>
<p>saying “Yes, yes” and “No, no” (2 Cor 1:17). e church cannot be the </p>
<p>pillar and bulwark of the truth (1 Tim 3:15) if its members cannot be </p>
<p>relied upon to keep their promises. God, who is the Truth, is fully reliable </p>
<p>and thus those who obey God should be reliable as well. </p>
<p>e younger widows learn to be idle (5:13). ey have no work to </p>
<p>do. ey are inactive (vs. 5:14). e “idle bellies” of the Cretans probably </p>
<p>alludes to the pleasure-seeking Cretan lifestyle.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>Inactivity is something</p>
<p>the women learn by study (manthanō). It is not a natural instinct accord-</p>
<p>ing to Paul. ey learn how not to work as they go from house to house, </p>
<p>in contrast to children who learn what it means to be godly as they take </p>
<p>care of their parents (5:4), and in contrast to the women who learn in an </p>
<p>armative manner about God the Savior (2:12) </p>
<p>Inactivity leads, then, to becoming talkers of falsehoods (phlua-</p>
<p>ros, 5:13) and superstitious people or “workers of magic” (periergos).</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Phlyaros, phlyareō, and phlyarias come from the root verb phlyō “‘to </p>
<p>boil up,’ ‘throw up bubbles’ of water; and since bubbles are hollow and </p>
<p>useless things, ‘to indulge in empty and foolish talk.’”</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>e women are</p>
<p>not so much talking in a “silly”</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>way, but rather in a non-productive</p>
<p>manner, about an “empty” philosophy (4 Macc 5:10), without truth (like </p>
<p>Diotrephes whose accusations against John and others were false and evil </p>
<p>slander (3 John 10). Paul has already insisted that the female ministers </p>
<p>not be slanderers but, rather, faithful (3:11), not women who do not keep </p>
<p>their promises (5:12). eir talk should not be “devoid of truth.”</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>at</p>
<p>kind of talk is a “waste of time” (Titus 3:9).</p>
<p>Empty time and empty talk lead to curiosity about things of which </p>
<p>there is no need (5:13). How can mere silliness and being a busybody </p>
