<p>Godly Overseeing (3:1–16) 89</p>
<p>verts to become deluded themselves (typhoomai) by the very teachings </p>
<p>they are resisting.</p>
<p>Typhoomai (3:6 delude) comes fro<span class="_ _1" />m the root <span class="ff2 ls11 ws25">typh<span class="_ _3" /></span><span class="ws0">ō<span class="ff2">, </span></span>“<span class="_ _4" />raise a smoke<span class="_ _2" />” </p>
<p>or “smoke,” “consume in smoke, burn slowly.”</p>
<p>255</p>
<p>e related typhos refers</p>
<p>to “delusion” or “vanity.”</p>
<p>256</p>
<p>e imagery suggests someone whose brain is</p>
<p>lled with smoke and therefore the mind is unclear, “not knowing any-</p>
<p>thing” (6:4). ey may “fall into” the same danger as Hymenaeus and </p>
<p>Alexander, who end up condemned (1:20). In the parable of the sower </p>
<p>the devil “takes away the word from” the hearts of some so that they do </p>
<p>not keep believing and do not end up saved (Luke 8:12). Possibly then the </p>
<p>condemnation or judgment of the devil is one that keeps new converts </p>
<p>from persisting in their Christian life. ey will not denitely fall into </p>
<p>the devil’s condemnation, but they might fall into it (subjunctive mood). </p>
<p>is idea is similar to the danger mentioned in 3:7:</p>
<p>257</p>
<p> But, it is neces-</p>
<p>sary also to have a good testimony from the outsiders, lest (s)he might </p>
<p>fall into reproach and a trap from the devil. is sentence summarizes </p>
<p>the section (3:2–7) by repeating it is necessary (3:2) and repeating the </p>
<p>concept of being irreproachable (3:2, anepilēmptos) in dierent words (a </p>
<p>good testimony from outsiders).</p>
<p>258</p>
<p>Two things in this passage can make</p>
<p>a believer vulnerable to falling: a new insuciently strong faith (3:6) and </p>
<p>a bad reputation from nonbelievers (3:7). A bad reputation might lead </p>
<p>to being denounced or insulted by outsiders.</p>
<p>259</p>
<p> Since the devil is a liar,</p>
<p>260</p>
<p> </p>
<p>false testimonies come ultimately from him. If at all possible, Paul wants </p>
<p>the overseers to avoid such unnecessary persecution. ese reproaches </p>
<p>and condemnations do not come aer lengthy warnings but are unex-</p>
<p>pected like snares or traps that suddenly catch animals such as birds,</p>
<p>261</p>
<p> </p>
<p>unawares. e Lord can save believers from such traps, if the believers are </p>
<p>pure themselves.</p>
<p>262</p>
<p>Paul now omits an initial “it is necessary” (dei), thereby, connecting</p>
<p>diakonos (ministers, 3:8) to the earlier “it is necessary,” which introduced </p>
<p>255. LSJ, 1838; cf. Matt 12:20 “smoldering wick.”</p>
<p>256. LSJ, 1838.</p>
<p>257. Also 1 Tim 5:14; 2 Tim 2:26.</p>
<p>258. See 1 Tim 3:2; Titus 1:6.</p>
<p>259. Of course, when the insults are on account of Jesus, they are to be received in </p>
<p>joy (Matt 5:11–12; Luke 6:22–23; 1 Pet 4:14–16).</p>
<p>260. John 8:44.</p>
