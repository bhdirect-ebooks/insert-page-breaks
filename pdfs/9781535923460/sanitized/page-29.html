<p>Introduction to 1 and 2 Timothy </p>
<p>Setting—Ephesus and Artemis</p>
<p>Ephesus was in the Roman province of Asia. Once Paul and Timothy </p>
<p>were forbidden to preach in the province of Asia by the Holy Spirit (Acts </p>
<p>16:6, c. A.D. 50), but eventually Ephesus became the home church for the </p>
<p>Apostle Paul’s mission for about three years (Acts 20:31, c. A.D. 54–56). </p>
<p>During these years he experienced marvels through God’s work and great </p>
<p>suering from persecution. He wrote 1 Corinthians from Ephesus (1 Cor </p>
<p>16:8).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>e hardships in Asia were so great, Paul and Timothy despaired</p>
<p>even of life, yet God delivered them (2 Cor 1:8–9). At Paul’s nal impris-</p>
<p>onment in Rome almost all of his coworkers from Asia deserted him (2 </p>
<p>Tim 1:15).</p>
<p>e city and the church had people of various ethnic groups. Paul </p>
<p>had extended discussions about Jesus in the synagogue and in Tyrannus’ </p>
<p>School.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Paul had many coworkers, some Jewish, including the Romans</p>
<p>Prisca and Aquila, his fellow tentmakers, learned Alexandrian Apollos, </p>
<p>Lycaonian Timothy, Macedonian Aristarchus, and possibly Alexander. </p>
<p>Paul also had friends and enemies among the Gentiles: the Asiarchs,</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>town clerk, Demetrius, and other artisans.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Paul’s traveling companions</p>
<p>Gaius, Timothy, Tychicus, and Trophimus were from Asia (Acts 20:4).</p>
<p>e disciples of John had no knowledge of the Spirit,</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>yet spiritually</p>
<p>much happened. Although he knew only John’s baptism, for example, </p>
<p>Apollos was on re with the Spirit. Great miracles occurred. Diseases </p>
<p>were healed (Acts 19:11–12). Sins were confessed publicly (Acts 19:18). </p>
