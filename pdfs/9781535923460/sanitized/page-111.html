<p>Godly Overseeing (3:1–16) 95</p>
<p>could be an elaborate villa with a set of rooms or a single room or even a </p>
<p>temple (Matt 12:4; 21:13),</p>
<p>280</p>
<p>but it would need stone pillars to support it.</p>
<p>While Paul elsewhere has used a variety of images to describe the church, </p>
<p>such as family,</p>
<p>281</p>
<p> body, a mature man,</p>
<p>282</p>
<p> a betrothed virgin,</p>
<p>283</p>
<p> a letter,</p>
<p>284</p>
<p> </p>
<p>light/stars,</p>
<p>285</p>
<p> and a sanctuary,</p>
<p>286</p>
<p>house or “home” is a familiar familial</p>
<p>image since believers have their own homes and households,</p>
<p>287</p>
<p>but they</p>
<p>are also part of God’s larger mansion (2 Tim 2:20–21). Most ancients </p>
<p>lived and traveled in community.</p>
<p>288</p>
<p> Churches would meet in homes.</p>
<p>289</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Being a faithful Christian has been described as being a faithful “stew-</p>
<p>ard” or manager of a household.</p>
<p>290</p>
<p>In the same way as pillars support a</p>
<p>building, like the temple (e.g., 1 Kgs 7:15), the church should support the </p>
<p>truth. Also, without truth the church cannot stand. Moreover, if God is a </p>
<p>living God, then God’s building is a “living” home. e goal of dwelling </p>
<p>in the home is love (1 Tim 1:5), but love itself rejoices in the truth (1 Cor </p>
<p>13:6) because truth sets the perimeters of knowledge.</p>
<p>Paul summarizes that truth in 3:16: And confessedly great is the </p>
<p>godly mystery: who was manifested in the esh, was declared righ-</p>
<p>teous in the spirit, was seen by angels, was proclaimed among na-</p>
<p>tions, was believed in the world, was taken up in glory. e ancients </p>
<p>celebrated many dierent mysteries (mystēria), which were syncretistic </p>
<p>cults with secret initiation rites, hierarchical, and oen sexually immoral. </p>
<p>Such cults may have originated in Crete in the Mycenaean Age. Primar-</p>
<p>ily women celebrated the mysteries of Dionysus and men the ones of </p>
<p>Mithras.</p>
<p>291</p>
<p>In contrast, Paul writes here of the godly mystery. Mystery</p>
<p>(mustērion) is a term Paul has used especially in 1 Corinthians, Ephe-</p>
<p>sians, and Colossians. It refers to a certain truth that was once hidden, </p>
