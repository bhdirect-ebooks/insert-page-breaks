<p>it (Luke 16:1). ey could dress in expensive clothing, have extra food, </p>
<p>and donate generously.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> ey were called rich even before they had sur-</p>
<p>plus crops (Luke 12:16–21). ey could aord to bring someone to court </p>
<p>(Jas 2:6). Zacchaeus, a chief tax collector, was rich (Luke 19:2). Ephesus </p>
<p>itself was renowned as a place of wealth.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>e Temple of Artemis was</p>
<p>the general bank of Asia. Worship of Artemis brought much wealth to </p>
<p>the area. e Ephesians were known as being devoted to luxury. As the </p>
<p>greatest metropolis of Asia, the gateway to Rome and Asia, the Ephesus </p>
<p>area would entice many to value wealth.</p>
<p>Paul does not simply speak to the rich, he also speaks to the poor </p>
<p>who desire to be wealthy. He warns them the rich fall (not walk) into </p>
<p>three unexpected things: temptation, a trap, foolish and harmful </p>
<p>desires (6:9). Temptation</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>can be things that occur from the outside</p>
<p>(“trials”) or from within (temptations). Paul had told the Ephesian </p>
<p>elders that he endured hardships (“trials”) when he was persecuted by </p>
<p>some Jews (Acts 20:19). Sometimes people try to entice one to sin by </p>
<p>presenting opportunities (temptations) that could resonate with internal </p>
<p>propensities to sin.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>At other times, the temptations are internal sinful</p>
<p>desires (Jas 1:13–15). e desire to be rich appears to be itself a tempta-</p>
<p>tion, however, theoretically, if someone were to desire to acquire wealth </p>
<p>in order to use it for distribution to the needy that would be a worthwhile </p>
<p>activity. ey would then be “rich in good works” and “generous” (1 Tim </p>
<p>6:18). Nevertheless, many who desire even to distribute their wealth, or </p>
<p>use it for moral purposes, instead get “choked” and their faith does not </p>
<p>“mature” (Luke 8:14). Wealth can limit the growth of faith like thorns </p>
<p>that choke a new plant (Luke 8:7). What is the temptation? Is it to prize </p>
<p>the wealth over God (Luke 16:13–15; 18:18–25)? Is it to depend on the </p>
<p>security of the wealth rather than the security of God (Luke 12:16–21)? Is </p>
<p>it to prefer comfort over the cost of discipleship (1 Cor 4:8–13)? Any one </p>
<p>of these temptations could lead to a trap.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>A trap is sudden, unexpected,</p>
<p>37. Luke 16:19–21; Mark 12:41.</p>
<p>38. See Introduction. Setting. Ephesus and Artemis; Trebilco 2004: 25–26.</p>
<p>39. Peirasmos (noun) and peirazō (verb).</p>
<p>40. For example, the devil tried to entice Jesus to sin by encouraging him to live </p>
<p>for the material, to worship the devil in order to obtain the glory and power of the </p>
<p>world’s kingdoms, and to test the Lord (Luke 4:2–13). Jesus, though, did not succumb </p>
<p>(Heb 2:14–18).</p>
<p>41. Pagis is a device used to catch animals (BDAG, 747). Literally, “that which </p>
