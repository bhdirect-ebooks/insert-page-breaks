<p>Introduction to Pastoral Letters10</p>
<p>and renewal by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Both in Romans 7 and 1 Timothy 1 the</p>
<p>law is good, but it is limited. Paul presents a powerful example of grace in </p>
<p>1 Timothy 1:12–16 and one mediator in 1 Timothy 2:5–6. Integrity about </p>
<p>money is always a concern for Paul, for example, he disparages “peddlers </p>
<p>of God’s word” (2 Cor 2:17) and, similarly, godliness is not a means of </p>
<p>gain (1 Tim 6:5). Pride is not the point of Romans 7. Rather, the point is </p>
<p>Paul cannot do what he wants. e Pastorals have baptism allusions, as </p>
<p>“washing of rebirth” (Titus 3:5). Even Dibelius and Conzelmann explain </p>
<p>the author is not writing against Marcion.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>Marxsen notes “we cannot</p>
<p>identify [the heretics] with any of the familiar Gnostic systems.”</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> Doce-</p>
<p>tism is more a problem in 1 John, than in 1 Timothy.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>e Pastoral Letters present us with overwhelming evidence that Paul </p>
<p>is their author. Bernard explains that the Pastorals appear: “in Gaul and </p>
<p>Greece in 177, in Rome in 140 (certainly)—as far back as 95, if we ac-</p>
<p>cept Clement’s testimony—and in Asia as early as 116.”</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>e letterheads</p>
<p>themselves and the early church claim Paul as author and the Pastorals as </p>
<p>part of the canon. e letters t into Paul’s life aer his rst release from </p>
<p>prison. e Pastoral vocabulary is no less unusual than the rest of Paul’s </p>
<p>letters. Right teaching was always Paul’s concern. He has the same basic </p>
<p>faith in Jesus as always.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these scholars have raised valuable questions: Can </p>
<p>we box a person as bourgeois or prophetic? Do we really understand </p>
<p>Paul? What is the place of the law? Where is the place of morality in the </p>
<p>Christian life? When have we moved from concern for the salvation of </p>
<p>others to concern for others’ salvation of us? To what extent are Paul’s </p>
<p>practices examples to be copied as opposed to examples with underlying </p>
<p>principles?</p>
<p>What dierence does authorship make? If Paul the apostle sent </p>
<p>from God did not write these letters, they are in reality advice from </p>
<p>some unknown Christian. Consequently, Hanson spends much of his </p>
<p>commentary positing “contradictions” between the Pastorals and Paul’s </p>
<p>35. 1 Tim 3:16; 4:1; 2 Tim 1:14; Titus 3:5.</p>
