<p>1 Timothy 140</p>
<p>tilian explains that a hypotypōsis is “any representation of facts which is </p>
<p>made in such vivid language that it appeals to the eye rather than the ear.” </p>
<p>It is a compelling illustration explaining in full detail how something was </p>
<p>done (Inst. 9.2.40). Education by model is such an eective and vivid </p>
<p>teaching tool.</p>
<p>Christ’s mercy and compassion toward Paul, a sinner, serve as a </p>
<p>model for those people considering belief in Jesus (the ones about to </p>
<p>believe, 1:16) in order to obtain eternal life.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>Some of those potential</p>
<p>believers are already at Ephesus—even including the heterodox teachers </p>
<p>(1:3–7)—while others are still to come, such as the rulers for whom they </p>
<p>are to pray (2:1–2).</p>
<p>Reecting on these marvelous truths about God, Paul, like many </p>
<p>rabbis or devout Jews,</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>breaks out into a blessing or prayer to God: Now</p>
<p>to the Ruler of the ages, imperishable, invisible, only God, be honor </p>
<p>and glory into the ages of the ages (forever and ever), amen (1:17).</p>
<p>128</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Who is the Ruler or King of the ages? Paul appears to refer to Jesus since </p>
<p>Christ Jesus is the most recent referent (1:14–16). Jesus told Pilate that he </p>
<p>was born to be king (John 18:37) and the angel tells John that the Lamb </p>
<p>“is Lord of lords and King of kings” (Rev 17:14). e name of the rider </p>
<p>of the white horse, who is called “Faithful and True,” is “Ruler of rulers </p>
<p>and Lord of lords” (Rev 19:11, 16).</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>Yet, since God is one, Paul could</p>
<p>be referring to the Trinity.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>God the Father is also possible since only</p>
<p>God the Father is invisible.</p>
<p>131</p>
<p>Later in the letter, Paul appears to refer to</p>
<p>Jesus as “the blessed and only Sovereign, the Ruler of rulers and Lord of </p>
<p>lords,” but to God the Father “whom no human has ever seen or can see” </p>
<p>(6:15–16).</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>God’s desire was always to rule directly over the people with</p>
<p>a prophet or judge to whom God would reveal his will, but the Israelites </p>
<p>preferred instead a king such as the Gentile nations had. e ruler could </p>
<p>126. See Titus 1:2.</p>
<p>127. “Blessed is he” is a common interjection when speaking of God, “the Holy </p>
<p>One,” e.g., m.‘Abot 3:2; 4:22.</p>
<p>128. See also other doxologies by Paul: 1 Tim 6:15–16; 2 Tim 4:18; Rom 11:36; </p>
<p>16:27; Gal 1:5; Eph 3:20–21; Phil 4:20. Ps 9:16 LXX also has “into the ages of the ages.”</p>
<p>129. See Titus 2:13. Mounce agrees that the immediate context suggests Jesus is </p>
<p>the “King” (2000: 60).</p>
<p>130. E.g., Ellicott 1865: 38.</p>
<p>131. Paul refers to the “Lord” in v. 14 and “God” in vv. 4, 11 and “Father” in v. 1.</p>
