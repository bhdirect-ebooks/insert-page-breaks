<p>Godly Overseeing (3:1–16) 79</p>
<p>investigation, visitation,”</p>
<p>199</p>
<p> frequently done by God,</p>
<p>200</p>
<p>but also by</p>
<p>humans.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Episkopos (overseer, 3:2) is a synonym for presbyteros (“elder”),</p>
<p>202</p>
<p> </p>
<p>God’s stewards or managers of a household, in this case God’s household, </p>
<p>and for God’s shepherds (poimēn), as in Acts 20:28. Paul has already ad-</p>
<p>dressed the elders at Ephesus as shepherds over a ock. e root idea of </p>
<p>episkopos, an overseer, may be seen in its etymology, one who “looks </p>
<p>upon” or “observes” another, so as to “watch over” or care for the other.</p>
<p>203</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jesus is the perfect “Shepherd and Overseer” of the lives of the sheep </p>
<p>(1 Pet 2:25), aer whom elders or overseers should model themselves.</p>
<p>204</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Xenophon, for example, describes the “overseers” in “well ordered cit-</p>
<p>ies” who enforce the laws passed by the citizens “commending the law-</p>
<p>abiding and punishing law-breakers.” e wife should do the same for </p>
<p>household laws (Oec. 9:14–15). us, the task of an “overseer” in the </p>
<p>Bible includes aspects of care, organization, and judgment. Most of the </p>
<p>attributes in the list are not roles but rather virtues, except for “hospitable, </p>
<p>apt in teaching, managing his/her own house well.” us, an overseer is a </p>
<p>teaching minister with gis of organization and hospitality.</p>
<p>A believer aspires to leadership not by grasping power over others </p>
<p>(1 Pet 5:3 katakyrieuō), but by aspiring to become the type of person </p>
<p>described in the following verses (3:2.). Women, too, who learn the </p>
<p>content and virtues of a sound Christian faith could aspire to and pre-</p>
<p>pare to be overseers. Episkopē (overseeing, 3:1) may refer to only 3:2–7, </p>
<p>but it probably refers to both oces (episkopos and diakonos, 3:2–12), </p>
<p>since therefore (3:2) immediately follows 3:1 and precedes the intercon-</p>
<p>nected oces, concluding with the explanatory statement as to the value </p>
<p>of leadership: “For the ones having served well acquire a good foothold </p>

<p>200. E.g., Gen 50:24–25; Exod 3:16; 13:19; 30:12.</p>
<p>201. E.g., Num 7:2; 14:29; 16:29. ayer explains that episkopē is an “act by which </p>
<p>God looks into and searches out the ways, deeds, character, of men, in order to adjudge </p>
<p>them their lot accordingly, whether joyous or sad” (ayer, 242); e.g., Luke 19:44; 1 Pet </p>
<p>2:12; Exod 30:12.</p>
<p>202. See Titus 1:5, 7. Cf. Belleville 2009: 66.</p>

<p>204. Eleazar, a priest and son of Aaron, oversaw the whole tabernacle and all inside </p>
<p>it including the oil, incense, and daily oering (Num 4:16). e tabernacle, house-</p>
<p>holds, the army, and building eorts had overseers (Judg 9:28; 2 Kgs 11:15, 18; 2 Chr </p>
<p>34:12, 17). Kelly explains that episkopos denotes “a wide variety of functionaries, e.g. </p>
<p>inspectors, civic and religious administrators, nance ocers” (1963: 73).</p>
