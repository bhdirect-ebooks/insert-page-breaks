<p>Godly Overseeing (3:1–16) 85</p>
<p>sobriety, wisdom, hospitality, good doctrine, not being pugnacious, not </p>
<p>greedy, and having cooperative children.</p>
<p>224</p>
<p>Both lists place a priority on</p>
<p>not giving the society a reason to attack and on maintaining faithfulness </p>
<p>in marriage. In 1 Timothy, more emphasis in the list is placed on wisdom, </p>
<p>good behavior, and the ability to teach. Some qualities are mentioned </p>
<p>only for the church at Ephesus: good behavior, gentleness, peaceableness, </p>
<p>and safeguarding a new convert. While the celebrants of Artemis might </p>
<p>be more encouraged to participate in intoxicated orgiastic practices and </p>
<p>the magical control of gods and humans (e.g., Acts 19:19), in contrast, </p>
<p>Paul was encouraging self-control, order, and gentleness. Although </p>
<p>Ephesus was a place of great wealth</p>
<p>225</p>
<p>and the heterodox teachers also</p>
<p>were promoting their own nancial gain,</p>
<p>226</p>
<p>the Christian overseers were</p>
<p>not to be greedy. Good teaching and models are important during times </p>
<p>of wrong teaching and controversy and speculation.</p>
<p>Kosmios (well behaved, 3:2) is a synonym for “wise” (sōphrōn). Kos-</p>
<p>mios is the same quality that the women who were aunting their attire </p>
<p>and the slaves who were not acting in a trustworthy manner needed to </p>
<p>develop.</p>
<p>227</p>
<p>Philoxenos (3:2, literally, one who “loves” a “stranger” or “guest </p>
<p>friend”) is the care of strangers. “Loving strangers” or being hospitable</p>
<p>228</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is a trait all Christians are to oer.</p>
<p>229</p>
<p>Having a positive attitude toward</p>
<p>strangers is a trait that goes back through Jewish history. Moses sum-</p>
<p>marizes God’s self-revelation as the “God of the gods and Lord of the </p>
<p>lords, the Mighty, the Great, the Strong, and the Wonderful, who is not </p>
<p>partial and does not take bribes, executing justice for orphan and widow </p>
<p>and loving every stranger, giving each one food and clothing” (Deut </p>
<p>10:17–18). e Hebrews, therefore, were to love the stranger because </p>
<p>they modeled aer God and they were once strangers themselves (Deut </p>
<p>10:19). ey were to feed and leave food for strangers.</p>
<p>230</p>
<p>Jesus, as God</p>
<p>incarnate, also taught the importance of hospitality: “I was a stranger and </p>
<p>you gathered me in” (Matt 25:35) and he invited the disciples to “Come, </p>
