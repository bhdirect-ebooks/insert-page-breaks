<p>1 Timothy 136</p>
<p>considered that he did both since he did not recognize Jesus as God and </p>
<p>he dishonored Christians.</p>
<p>A violent person (hybristēs) inicts both verbal (Luke 11:45) and </p>
<p>physical acts of abuse, but primarily physical abuse. Verbal abuse seems </p>
<p>a precursor to physical abuse.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p> e same word is used for violent bat-</p>
<p>tering from a storm.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>Acts describes Paul as attacking, dishonoring, and</p>
<p>physically abusing Christians, condemning them to prison and to death </p>
<p>(Acts 8:3). He “punished” them in synagogues to cause them “to blas-</p>
<p>pheme.” He was “enraged at them” (Acts 26:11). He treated the Christians </p>
<p>the way he later was treated, for example, by the Jews from Antioch and </p>
<p>Iconium who stoned Paul and dragged him outside Lystra.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>In contrast,</p>
<p>Paul worked within the law. Of course, he thought he was acting in ac-</p>
<p>cordance with God’s will. Paul may have heard the Christian message, but </p>
<p>he was not able to understand it (being ignorant, agnoeō, 1:13) because it </p>
<p>did not t his presuppositions. In a similar way, Jesus’ disciples could not </p>
<p>comprehend why the Messiah had to suer and that he would resurrect </p>
<p>(Mark 9:32).</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>Saul (Paul) may have persecuted Christians for about a</p>
<p>year (Acts 8:1–9:4, c. A.D. 34–35). Possibly, Paul had some Christians </p>
<p>inicted with forty minus one stripes (m. Mak. 3:10–13) or he had them </p>
<p>stoned (m. Sanh. 7:4–5). He certainly had them killed (Acts 26:10).</p>
<p>But the same Lord who saved and strengthened Paul had also been </p>
<p>merciful with him: But our Lord’s grace overowed with faith and love, </p>
<p>the one in Christ Jesus (1:14). Normally when faith and love occur to-</p>
<p>gether, they refer to human faith and love of a church, a household, or </p>
an individual.
<p>110</p>
<p>However, in 1 Timothy 1:14 and 2 Timothy 1:13, faith</p>
<p>and love reside in Jesus.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>Understandably, love is an attribute of Jesus</p>
<p>because God is love (1 John 4:16), but how can faith reside in Jesus? Do </p>
<p>106. E.g., Matt 22:6; Luke 18:32; Acts 14:5.</p>
<p>107. Acts 27:10, 18, 21.</p>
<p>108. Acts 14:19; 2 Cor 11:23–26; 12:10.</p>
<p>109. See also 2 Pet 2:12.</p>
<p>110. E.g., 1 Tim 4:12; 6:11; 2 Tim 2:22; 3:10; 1 ess 1:3; 3:6; 5:8; Col 1:4; Phlm 5; </p>
<p>Rev 2:19.</p>
<p>111. e article aer “love” creates an appositive. Whose faith and love?—the one </p>
<p>in Christ Jesus. For a similar interpretation, see Quinn &amp; Wacker 2000: 132; Mounce </p>
<p>2000: 53, 55; Fee 1988: 52; Bernard 1922: 31; Ellicott 1865: 34. Eph 6:23 mentions </p>
<p>that love and faith can come from “God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” Other </p>
<p>interpreters conclude that the faith and love are human actions toward Jesus, e.g., Lock </p>
<p>1924: 15; Robertson 1931: 564.</p>
