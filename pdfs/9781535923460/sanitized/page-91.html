<p>Godly Peaceful Lives (2:1–15) 75</p>
<p>Artemis herself was the virgin goddess. In contrast, Paul’s teachings here </p>
<p>by implication (but stated directly later), presuppose that matter is good </p>
<p>because all God created is good, food and clothing are good (4:4; 6:8). </p>
<p>God wants believers to enjoy God’s material gis but not place hope on </p>
<p>them (6:17). Even the use of wine may be necessary (5:23). Marriage </p>
<p>too is good, as well as household management, and childbearing.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>noun form (teknogonia, 5:14) in 2:15 has the same root as the verbal form </p>
<p>(teknogoneō).</p>
<p>178</p>
<p>In a church with a low view of marriage and childbearing</p>
<p>(4:3), Paul describes the Christian message from the perspective of e </p>
<p>Childbirth to set the stage for the younger widows to understand a later </p>
<p>command in the letter (5:14).</p>
<p>Interpretations of 1 Timothy 2:15a may be categorized broadly </p>
<p>based on their understanding of the literal (physical) or metaphorical </p>
<p>(spiritual) sense of save and childbirth/childbearing:</p>
<p>(1) save is literal and childbirth is literal: for example, “God ... will de-</p>
<p>liver her through childbearing” (e Voice); “a wife will be brought </p>
<p>safely through by giving birth to their children” (CEB);</p>
<p>(2) save is metaphorical and childbirth is literal, where childbearing </p>
<p>is a synecdoche for the role of mother: for example, “she shall be </p>
<p>saved in childbearing” (KJV); “salvation for the woman will be in </p>
<p>the bearing of children” (REB);</p>
<p>(3) save is metaphorical and childbirth is literal, where childbirth is a </p>
<p>synecdoche for Childbirth by Mary: for example, “she will be saved </p>
<p>by the Child-bearing” (NTME); “women are saved through the </p>
<p>birth of the Child” (New Translation).</p>
<p>I do not accept the rst interpretation because sōzō elsewhere in </p>
<p>Paul’s letters, including the Pastoral Letters, has a metaphorical sense.</p>
<p>179</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>do not accept the second interpretation because childbirth is not the same </p>
<p>as rearing children or undertaking a domestic role, as in teknotropheō </p>
<p>or oikodespoteō (1 Tim 5:10, 14). is interpretation would contradict </p>
<p>Paul’s understanding elsewhere that salvation comes by grace through </p>
<p>faith (Eph 2:4–10; Rom 4:2–5:1), as Paul explains God “saved us” “not </p>
<p>177. 1 Tim 3:4–5, 12; 5:10, 14.</p>
<p>178. Neither word occurs any where else in the N.T. or LXX. In contrast, the more </p>
<p>frequent tiktō (verb) has no comparable noun.</p>
<p>179. Nevertheless, the death of the mother in childbirth was a major concern in </p>
<p>biblical times (e.g., m. Sabb. 2:6; Cohick 2009: 135–37, 140; Cox &amp; Ackerman 2009: </p>
<p>140). See also Keener 1992: 118–19.</p>
