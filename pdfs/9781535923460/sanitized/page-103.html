<p>Godly Overseeing (3:1–16) 87</p>
<p>all respectfulness. But, if anyone does not know how to manage his/</p>
<p>her own household, how will (s)he take care of God’s church? (3:4–5). </p>
<p>In Titus, the emphasis is on “having faithful children, not in accusation </p>
<p>of wildness or disobedience,”</p>
<p>240</p>
<p>whereas in 1 Timothy the emphasis is</p>
<p>on management of a household. In a similar way, as an overseer’s faith-</p>
<p>ful relationship to a spouse mirrors the overseer’s faithful relationship to </p>
<p>God, an overseer’s ability to oversee a household should help in oversee-</p>
<p>ing God’s household (3:2, 4–5). Both overseers (episkopos) and ministers </p>
<p>(diakonos) are exhorted to manage (proistēmi) their households (3:4, 12). </p>
<p>Proistēmi</p>
<p>241</p>
<p>(3:4, 5) normally has to do with leadership. e overseers and</p>
<p>ministers lead by “standing before” the church and their households. is </p>
<p>is also a spiritual gi that must be done with “earnestness” (Rom 12:8). </p>
<p>In Romans 12, it is distinguished from prophecy, ministry, teaching, </p>
<p>encouragement, giving, and being merciful (12:6–8). us, possibly it re-</p>
<p>fers more to governing or management and organization (a synonym of </p>
<p>kubernēsis, 1 Cor 12:28) than to leadership in general, although it is also </p>
<p>a type of leadership. Paul uses proistēmi as a term to describe all church </p>
<p>leaders who serve a congregation: “respect those who labor among you, </p>
<p>and have charge of you in the Lord and admonish you; esteem them very </p>
<p>highly in love because of their work” (1 ess 5:12–13 NRSV). In the Sep-</p>
<p>tuagint, proistēmi also connotes leadership synonymous with “steward” </p>
<p>(episkopos)</p>
<p>242</p>
<p> or the overseeing of a household or an army troop.</p>
<p>243</p>
<p>When</p>
<p>it comes to overseeing a household, Paul directs the younger widows to </p>
<p>do so: to be the master or steward of the household.</p>
<p>244</p>
<p>e noun forms of</p>
<p>proistēmi are prostatēs and prostatis.</p>
<p>245</p>
<p>Prostatēs has been used in the Old</p>
<p>Testament for the chief ocers and overseers for kings.</p>
<p>246</p>
<p>Josephus uses</p>
<p>the term consistently for the leader of a nation, tribe, region, and even for </p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>247</p>
<p> Phoebe, a “minister” of a specic church, Cenchreae, is an over-</p>
<p>seer or leader (prostatis).</p>
<p>248</p>
<p>us, the New Testament includes examples</p>
<p>240. See Titus 1:6.</p>
<p>241. Literally, “set over,” or “stand before” (LSJ, 1482–83). See Titus 3:8. </p>
<p>242. See Titus 1:5–7.</p>
<p>243. 2 Sam 3:17; Amos 6:10; Prov 23:5;1 Macc 5:19.</p>
<p>244. 1 Tim 5:14 oikodespoteō (LSJ, 1204).</p>
<p>245. LSJ, 1526 denes prostatēs as “one who stands before,” “leader, chief,” “ruler,” </p>
<p>“president or presiding ocer,” “patron.”</p>
<p>246. 1 Chr 27:31; 29:6; 2 Chr 8:10; 24:11.</p>
