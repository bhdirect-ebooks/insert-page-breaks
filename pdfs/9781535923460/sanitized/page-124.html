<p>1 Timothy 4:1—5:2108</p>
<p>(4:6–5:2), ending with directions on how to treat widows (5:3). He will </p>
<p>close the letter with two exhortations also addressed directly to Timothy </p>
<p>(6:11–16, 20).</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>us, the term “Pastoral Letters or Epistles” brings out</p>
<p>this aspect of the letters, Paul, a pastor, is writing to his coworkers, Timo-</p>
<p>thy and Titus, to guide them as they pastor other Christians. </p>
<p>ese two-pronged aspects of the letter may be seen in verse 6. Two </p>
<p>things make a good minister of Christ Jesus (as opposed to a bad one): </p>
<p>(1) making known these things to the brothers and sisters and (2) be-</p>
<p>ing nourished by the words of the faith and by the good teaching (4:6). </p>
<p>One action is outward, the other is inward. Outwardly, Timothy is to sup-</p>
<p>ply (make known, hypotithēmi)</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>to his adopted siblings (brothers and</p>
<p>sisters)</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> all that Paul has previously instructed in the letter. Simultane-</p>
<p>ously, Timothy needs to make sure he himself is nourished or trained </p>
<p>and educated (entrephō).</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>He should regularly “feed” himself by two</p>
<p>means: the words of the faith and the good teaching which he followed </p>
<p>(4:6). ese two phrases appear to be synonymous. Possibly, words of the </p>
<p>faith refer specically to summary creeds, such as in 3:16, and teaching </p>
<p>is a broader term which includes all Timothy was taught and has done.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It would include, but not be limited to, “reading” the Scriptures (4:13; 2 </p>
<p>Tim 3:14–17).</p>
<p>38. e second person singular is used for Timothy in his capacity as a leader </p>
<p>overseeing the church (1:3; 3:14–15; 5:3, 7, 11, 19–22; 6:2, 17) and as a believer aiming </p>
<p>to persevere in the faith (1:18; 4:6–5:2, 23; 6:11–14, 20).</p>
<p>39. ayer, 645; BDAG, 1042.</p>
<p>40. Adelphos (“brother”) in the plural is normally generic (LSJ, 20). e church </p>
<p>has women as well as men (e.g., 1 Tim 2:8–15; 5:3–16). In Phil 4:1, Paul addresses </p>
<p>adelphos (plural) followed closely by the names of women (Eudia, Syntyche) and a </p>
<p>man (Clement) (4:2–3). Luke uses adelphos (plural) to describe Lydia, Paul, Silas, </p>
<p>and others (Acts 16:40). “Brother” is a metaphor of equality (Josephus, Ant. 19.1.1 </p>
<p>[4]). Adelphos in the plural is translated: “brothers and sisters” (NRSV, TNIV, NLT); </p>
<p>“believers” (TEV, CEB, New Trans.); “followers” (CEV); “brothers” (NIV, JB, ESV); </p>
<p>“brethren” (KJV, NASB); “brotherhood” (REB).</p>
<p>41. e root trephō is used of feeding birds (Matt 6:26; Luke 12:24) and humans </p>
<p>(Matt 25:37; Luke 23:29; Acts 12:20; Rev 12:6, 14) and being reared (Luke 4:16); </p>
<p>ayer, 219; LSJ, 577.</p>
<p>42. Cf. Kelly (1963: 98): “diligently studied and perseveringly practiced”; Towner </p>
<p>(2006: 304): Paul refers to “a body of tradition articulated in teachable doctrine” and </p>
<p>“the gospel polemically as measurably superior to the false teaching”; Mounce (2000: </p>
<p>249): Paul distinguishes between “basic gospel message” and “the doctrinal teaching </p>
<p>that comes out of it.”</p>
