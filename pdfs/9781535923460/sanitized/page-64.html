<p>1 Timothy 2–348</p>
<p>we thank God, our thanks are an acknowledgement or confession of be-</p>
<p>lief in God’s work in the world and in our lives.</p>
<p>Timothy and the other believers should pray for everyone (2:1). </p>
<p>Paul begins with a more specic term (rulers, basileus) and then </p>
<p>continues with a more general or abstract phrase: everyone cur-</p>
<p>rently (“being”) in a position of prominence (hyperochē). Paul </p>
<p>wants them to pray for such rulers as Emperor Nero and King </p>
<p>Agrippa II (Acts 25:13; 26:2), the proconsul in Ephesus, and any kings or </p>
<p>queens in Asia Minor. A ruler would be someone wealthy and powerful </p>
<p>with a sta and an army over a country or city-state.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Paul also wants</p>
<p>them to pray for anyone having authority or prominence, such as, the </p>
<p>provincial Roman consul or governor, the local political and religious </p>
<p>leaders, and the local Jewish and Christian leaders. </p>
<p>In Titus 3:1–2 and Romans 13:1, Paul exhorts the Christians to be </p>
<p>subject to those in positions of authority.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy, he explains</p>
<p>that the advantage of praying for those in leadership is that they can help </p>
<p>Christians to live in tranquility.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Both ēremos and hēsychios include the</p>
<p>idea of quiet, stillness, and rest.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Hēsychios (adj.) in 2:2 is the same word</p>
<p>family as hēsychia (noun) in 2:11–12</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>showing that what Paul wants</p>
<p>for women, he also wants for all Christians: a state of calm and rest. is </p>
<p>life was to be lived out in godliness (eusebeia) and holiness (semnotēs). </p>
<p>Godly living is an important trait for Christians, especially as they live in </p>
<p>a secular world.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> </p>
<p>People living in tranquility furthers God’s purposes: is is good </p>
<p>and acceptable before our Savior God, who wants all humans to be </p>
<p>saved and to come into knowledge of truth (2:3–4). Living a “quiet </p>
<p>life” “in all godliness and holiness” is good because it helps God to reach </p>
<p>God’s desire of salvation for all humans. Jesus explained that not many </p>
<p>will remain faithful,</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>nevertheless, God wants all people to believe in</p>
<p>14. E.g., Matt 11:8; 18:23; 22:2–7; Luke 14:31.</p>
<p>15. See Titus 3:1.</p>
<p>16. Keener (1992: 102, 121–22) reminds us that Jews also prayed for the emperor.</p>
<p>17. LSJ, 777–79.</p>
<p>18. See 1 Tim 2:11.</p>
<p>19. Titus 1:1; 2:12. Eusebeia was also a secular concept referring to a “right rela-</p>
<p>tionship” to the god/dess that blessed the city (Strelan 1996: 28–29). For Paul, a right </p>
<p>relationship to God would also bless the secular people. On semnos, see Titus 2:2.</p>
<p>20. Matt 7:14; Luke 18:8. Sider (2005) similarly notes that few Americans take </p>
<p>seriously the Christian worldview (e.g., 126–130).</p>
