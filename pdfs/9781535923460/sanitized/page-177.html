<p>e Rich (6:17–19) 161</p>
<p>The Rich (6:17–19)</p>
<p>Paul adds an admonition directly for the rich as a group (vs. 6:9–10 </p>
<p>is addressed to Timothy about wealth), as he did for overseers, </p>
<p>ministers/deacons, widows, and slaves: To the rich ones in the now </p>
<p>age—charge not to be haughty and not to hope upon the uncertainty </p>
<p>of riches but upon God, the one supplying to us all things richly to en-</p>
<p>joy, to do good, to be rich in good works, to be free to give, to be ready </p>
<p>to share, storing up for themselves a good foundation for the future, in </p>
<p>order that they might grasp the real life (6:17–19). Paul wants Timothy </p>
<p>to instruct</p>
<p>116</p>
<p> the wealthy</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>in six ways: not to be haughty, not to hope</p>
<p>upon the uncertainty of riches, but, rather, to hope upon God, to do </p>
<p>good, to be rich in good works, and to be free to give. How can anyone </p>
<p>be haughty aer comparing oneself with “the blessed and only ruler, the </p>
<p>ruler of the ones ruling and lord of the ones being lords, the only one hav-</p>
<p>ing immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no humans saw </p>
<p>and no one is able to see” (6:15–16)? Hyphēlophroneō (haughty, 6:17), </p>
<p>literally, is “to be high-minded” since hyphēlos is “high; loy.”</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>Hyphēlos</p>
<p>may refer to a very high mountain (Matt 4:8; 17:1). Ancients would build </p>
<p>their fortresses oen on top of high mountains for protection. A pile of </p>
<p>wealth, too, can serve for protection. But only God is “the Majesty on </p>
<p>high” (Heb 1:3). e rich believers are not to be like the Gentiles who </p>
<p>think they are superior (hyphēlos) to the Jews because they have replaced </p>
<p>some unbelieving Jews in God’s kingdom (Rom 11:20). Rather, the rich </p>
<p>should think they are the same as others, not thinking themselves to be </p>
<p>superior, but rather to associate with the lowly (Rom 12:16).</p>
<p>In contrast to relying upon riches, the rich are to rely upon God.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> </p>
<p>God has already been described as “the one giving life to all things” </p>
<p>(6:13). In 6:17, God is the one supplying to us all things richly to enjoy. </p>
<p>Paul had already explained that God supplies many material gis, such </p>
<p>as marriage and foods, which should be enjoyed in a thankful manner </p>
<p>(4:3–4). Ecclesiastes similarly states it is good “to eat and to drink” since </p>
<p>that is “God’s gi” to those whom God has given “wealth and posses-</p>
<p>sions” to enjoy (Eccl 5:17–18 LXX). However, “if wealth should ow in, </p>
<p>set not your heart upon it” (Ps 61:10 LXX).</p>
<p>116. See 1 Tim 4:11.</p>
<p>117. See 1 Tim 6:9.</p>
<p>118. ayer, 646.</p>
<p>119. Ps 51:7 LXX.</p>
