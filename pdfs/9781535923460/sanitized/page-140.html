<p> e Old Testament has numerous laws and prophetic mes-</p>
<p>sages showing God’s special concern for widows. Widows are an example </p>
<p>of a group of people easily oppressed who should have justice. God who </p>
<p>is “great and strong and awesome, who is not partial” “executes justice for </p>
<p>stranger and orphan and widow” (Deut 10:17–18).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>About thirty years</p>
<p>earlier, the church had already been presented with the problem of needy </p>
<p>widows (Acts 6:1–6). Tabitha (Dorcas) of Joppa had become renowned </p>
<p>because she devoted herself to making clothing for the widows of her city </p>
<p>(Acts 9:36–41). Paul’s solution is to pay certain widows to do a prayer </p>
<p>ministry, thereby resolving a nancial need and creating an opportunity </p>
<p>to advance God’s kingdom. </p>
<p>ese are the characteristics of a “real” versus a “false” widow:</p>
<p>Real Widow False Widow</p>
<p>1. le alone, has hoped on God (5:5) 1. has children or grandchildren who </p>
<p>should provide (5:4, 8, 16)</p>
<p>2. continues in prayers night and day </p>
<p>(v.5)</p>
<p>2. lives luxuriously (v. 6) Cf. 1 Tim 3:3, </p>
<p>8; Titus 1:7</p>
<p>3. is not open to attack (v. 7) Cf. 1Tim </p>
<p>3:2</p>
<p>3. some have turned away aer Satan </p>
<p>(v. 15)</p>
<p>4. 60+ years of age (v. 9) </p>
<p>Cf. Titus 1:5, 7</p>
<p>4. younger than 60 (v. 9)</p>
<p>5. a one-man woman (v. 9) </p>
<p>Cf. 1 Tim 3:2, 12</p>
<p>6. bearing witness by good works (v. </p>
<p>10) (cf. Titus 1:8):</p>
<p>Brought up children (cf. 1 Tim 3:4, 12),</p>
<p>Showed hospitality (cf. 1 Tim 3:2),</p>
<p>Washed feet of saints,</p>
<p>Helped those being oppressed,</p>
<p>Devoted herself to every good work</p>
<p>6. idle; goes around the households, </p>
<p>speaking of that of which there is </p>
<p>no need (5:13) (cf. 1 Tim 3:11; Titus </p>
<p>1:8)</p>
<p>7. made vow not to remarry (5:12) 7. might want to marry (5:11) </p>
<p>9. NewDocs 3:20.</p>
<p>10. David calls God the “Father of the orphans and judge of the widows,” because </p>
<p>God promises to protect, care, and vindicate them (Ps 67:5 LXX; Exod 22:22–24; Deut </p>
<p>14:28–29; 24:17–22; 26:12–13; 27:19; Ps 146:9; Ezek 22:7; Zech 7:9–10; Mal 3:5.) See </p>
<p>Spencer &amp; Spencer 1990b: 48–50. One of the reasons Israel and Judah were allowed by </p>
<p>God to be defeated by Assyria and Babylon was because God’s people did not “defend </p>
<p>the orphan, plead for the widow” (Isa 1:17 NRSV). See also Isa 1:23; 10:1–2; Jer 7:5–7; </p>
<p>22:3.</p>
