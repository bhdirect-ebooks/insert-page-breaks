<p>Fusing the Horizons: Living with Wealth</p>
<p>Few people consider themselves “rich.” However, statistically, most of us </p>
<p>in “developed” countries are “rich,” if we consider that at least 80% of </p>
<p>humans live on less than $10 U.S./day.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>If we begin with this basis, then</p>
<p>we are indeed “rich.” So what should we do about it? </p>

<p>others to enjoy these too.</p>
<p>2. Be satisﬁed with the basic necessities of food, clothing, and shelter. </p>
<p>Beware of simply wanting what others have or others expect you to </p>
<p>have.</p>
<p>3. Work on getting your security from God, not wealth, and seek to please </p>
<p>God in words and actions. </p>

<p>knowledge, with which some, professing concerning the faith, missed </p>
<p>the mark. Grace be with you (6:20–21). Paul addresses Timothy with </p>
<p>an exclamation of anguish and depth of feeling (oh!)</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>and then focuses</p>
<p>on what Timothy has to guard—the deposit (6:20).</p>
