<p>Godly Overseeing (3:1–16) 81</p>
<p>order was also to be a “one-man woman” (5:9). Normally, the modiers </p>
<p>in Greek follow the noun modied, but, in all these cases, they precede </p>
<p>the noun, thereby emphasizing the modiers “one woman” (or “one </p>
<p>man”). e adjective also restricts the noun. Paul refers not just to a man, </p>
<p>but to a one-woman man. e total concept expressed would be that a </p>
<p>male overseer, if married, must be a man who is faithful and devoted and </p>
<p>focused on only one woman. is phrase is another way to express that </p>
<p>the men are to love “their own wives as their own bodies” (Eph 5:28). </p>
<p>Here are dierent ways Bible versions have translated the phrase:</p>

<p>Paul’s directive would contrast with the Roman and Greek practice </p>
<p>of not considering it “adultery” if a married man had sexual relations </p>
<p>with a slave, concubine, or a prostitute. Roman slaves legally never mar-</p>
<p>ried, they cohabitated (contubernium), although, to the slaves, their mar-</p>
<p>riages were valid. e slave women could not be accused of adultery.</p>
