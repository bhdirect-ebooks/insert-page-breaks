<p>1 Timothy 2–358</p>
<p>Paul’s time. Paul switches from the plural for “women” (2:9, 10) to the </p>
<p>generic singular (woman, 2:11), most likely, to introduce or set up the </p>
<p>illustration of Eve which follows (2:13–14). Aerwards, Paul repeats the </p>
<p>singular (2:15a) but returns back to the plural (“they,” 2:15b). Paul uses </p>
<p>the imperative let learn (manthanō). is is the rst imperative in the </p>
<p>letter.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p> e women were to learn, especially by study.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>Manthanō could</p>
<p>refer to the acquisition of knowledge or skill gained by instruction,</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>such</p>
<p>as when the centurion Claudius Lysias “learned” Paul was a Roman citi-</p>
<p>zen (Acts 23:26–27). Manthanō can also refer to the thoughtful ponder-</p>
<p>ing for further understanding of the signicance of Scripture, a message, </p>
<p>nature, a person, or experience,</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>as when Jesus challenged the Pharisees</p>
<p>to “learn” the meaning of “I desire mercy and not sacrice” (Matt 9:13) or </p>
<p>when Paul challenged the Corinthians to “learn” the meaning of “Noth-</p>
<p>ing beyond what is written” (1 Cor 4:6). Paul, who himself was considered </p>
<p>a learned man even by Governor Porcius Festus and a student of Rabbi </p>
<p>Gamaliel (Acts 22:3; 26:24), wanted the women to acquire knowledge </p>
<p>and reect on the signicance of Christian truth. As a man rabbinically </p>
<p>trained, Paul would know that women were not obligated to study nor </p>
<p>did they receive any merit in studying nor was anyone obligated to teach </p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>Paul emphasized that women were to learn in silence</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>because the</p>
<p>ancients considered this the best way to learn, as Simon, the son of Paul’s </p>
<p>teacher, Rabbi Gamaliel, summarized: “All my days have I grown up </p>
<p>among the Sages and I have found naught better for a man than silence; </p>
<p>and not the expounding [of the Law] is the chief thing but the doing [of </p>
<p>it]; and he that multiplies words occasions sin.”</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>Silence had positive</p>
<p>connotations among the ancient Jews because the Old Testament has </p>
<p>“woman” from “wife.” For example, Eph 5:22 begins “the women to their own men,” </p>
<p>as does 1 Cor 7:2; 14:35; and 1 Pet 3:1. Col 3:18–19, which is a brief summary of Eph </p>
<p>5:22–33, has the denite article. In contrast, 1 Tim 3:11 has no article or pronoun with </p>
<p>“women.”</p>
<p>84. It is one of only ve present imperatives third person singular verbs in 1 Tim. </p>
<p>Most imperatives (second person singular) in the letter are addressed to Timothy.</p>

<p>87. Matt 9:13; 24:32–33; 1 Cor 4:6; Eph 4:20; Phil 4:11; Col 1:7; Titus 3:14.</p>
<p>88. See 1 Tim 1:7.</p>
<p>89. Or “quietness.” “Silence” is emphasized by being placed before the verb in 2:11 </p>
<p>and by being repeated at the end of 2:12.</p>
