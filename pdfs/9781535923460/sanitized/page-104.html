<p>1 Timothy 2–388</p>
<p>of female overseers: not only Phoebe, but also the Apostle Junia, Elect </p>
<p>Lady, the Elect Sister (2 John 1, 13), and coworkers Euodia, Syntyche, </p>
<p>Prisca, and possibly also Stephana, Tryphaena, Tryphosa, Chloe, Lydia, </p>
<p>Mark’s mother, Nympha, and Apphia.</p>
<p>249</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even though a household could include twenty to thirty people,</p>
<p>250</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul is most concerned for the overseer’s relationship to the chil-</p>
<p>dren, probably referring to minors. Are the children cooperative and </p>
<p>supportive?</p>
<p>251</p>
<p>e cooperation is not done out of fear of the parents, but</p>
<p>out of respect toward them. e same attribute (semnotēs, 3:4)</p>
<p>252</p>
<p>is used</p>
<p>of the way the whole church should live in the world amidst the govern-</p>
<p>ing authorities (1 Tim 2:2), and the way “ministers” (diakonos) should </p>
<p>act (3:8). </p>
<p>e goal of managing (proistēmi) one’s household and God’s </p>
<p>household is further claried by the synonym epimeleomai (“take care,” </p>
<p>3:5).</p>
<p>253</p>
<p>When Paul’s friends provided him with food and provisions for</p>
<p>his travel by sea, they too “took care” of him (Acts 27:3). In the same way </p>
<p>as overseers are hospitable (3:2), treating guests as family, they also need </p>
<p>to manage (3:4–5), treating family as guests. Care of the church and the </p>
<p>home needs to be holistic, motivated by love (1:5).</p>
<p>Paul continues describing an ideal overseer: (It is necessary the </p>
<p>overseer to be) not newly planted, having been deluded, (s)he might </p>
<p>fall into the condemnation of the devil (3:6). A “neophyte” or “recent </p>
<p>convert” is aptly described as someone newly planted.</p>
<p>254</p>
<p>Paul’s imagery</p>
<p>is reminiscent of Jesus’ parable of the sower where the seeds which fell </p>
<p>on the rock “grew” (phyō) but then they withered because they had no </p>
<p>moisture or the seeds which fell among thorns “sprouted forth” (phyō) </p>
<p>but were later choked (Luke 8:6–7). ese plants represent those who fall </p>
<p>away in a time of testing or who get distracted by worries or wealth or </p>
<p>pleasures (Luke 8:13–14). e danger in Ephesus is for these new con-</p>
<p>ocial (1991: 109).</p>

<p>250. See Titus 1:6 on “household” and “children.”</p>
<p>251. See hupotassō Titus 3:1. Belleville (2009: 69) renders as “a voluntary waiving </p>
<p>of self-interest for the common good.”</p>
<p>252. See also Titus 2:2; 1 Tim 2:2.</p>
<p>253. e good Samaritan “took care” of the person who was robbed, beaten, and </p>
<p>le half dead, by being moved with compassion, approaching him, bandaging and </p>
<p>medicating his wounds, bringing him on his own means of transportation to an inn, </p>
<p>and paying for his care (Luke 10:33–35).</p>
