<p>1 Timothy 6:3–21158</p>
<p>the ruler of the ones ruling and lord of the ones being lords, (3) the </p>
<p>only one having immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light (6:15). </p>
<p>Paul has begun and ended the letter with a doxology (1:17). e rst one </p>
<p>was in a response of gratitude to what Christ did in Paul’s life, the second </p>
<p>one was as a motivator for Timothy, the One with whom Timothy would </p>
<p>spend eternal life, who is worthy of Timothy’s “good ght of the faith” </p>
<p>(6:12) and serves as a contrast to rich humans (6:17). God gives life to </p>
<p>all (6:13) and therefore also is the source of eternal life (1:16; 6:12). e </p>
<p>doxologies in both passages may be compared:</p>
<p>Doxologies</p>
<p>1:17 6:15–16</p>
<p>e ruler (basileus) of the ages </p>
<p>(aiōn),</p>
<p>e blessed and only (monos) ruler </p>
<p>(dynastēs);</p>
<p>e ruler (basileus) of the ones </p>
<p>ruling and</p>
<p>Lord (kyrios) of the ones being </p>
<p>lords,</p>
<p>Imperishable (aphthartos), e only one (monos) having im-</p>
<p>mortality (athanasia),</p>
<p>Invisible (aoratos), </p>
<p>only (monos) God,</p>
<p>Dwelling in unapproachable light,</p>
<p>whom no humans saw and no one </p>
<p>is able to see</p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p>Be honor (timē) and glory forever </p>
<p>(aiōn) and ever, amen.</p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p>To whom be honor (timē) and </p>
<p>power forever (aiōnios), amen..</p>
<p>Both passages appear to describe Jesus at rst because of the ante-</p>
<p>cedents (1:14–16; 6:14) but then conclude appearing to describe God the </p>
<p>Father (“invisible” [1:17] whom no one among humans saw, neither is </p>
<p>able to see [6:16]). Both describe the triune God rst as the unique ruler </p>
<p>or sovereign. e closing doxology emphasizes how God is unique (only </p>
<p>ruler), particularly in comparison to human rulers. Humans are cur-</p>
<p>rently ruling, but God always will be the ruler. ree synonyms are used </p>
<p>agrees with its antecedent epiphaneia (appearing, 6:14), thereby suggesting the pas-</p>
<p>sage refers to Jesus Christ (6:14). However, Jesus was seen by angels and humans (3:16 </p>
<p>vs. 6:16), suggesting the doxology refers to God the Father. Reveal appears to be the </p>
<p>key connection. Jesus will reveal fully the nature of the unseen God the Father (cf. </p>
<p>John 1:18; 6:46; 14:9). See also Marshall 1999: 654. </p>
