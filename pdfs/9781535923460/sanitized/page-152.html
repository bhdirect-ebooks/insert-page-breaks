<p>1 Timothy 5:3—6:2136</p>
<p>Elders (presbyteros, presbytera) have been mentioned earlier as worthy of </p>
<p>respect (5:1–2). “Elders” and “overseers” are synonymous terms.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>Here</p>
<p>Paul chooses the more Jewish term presbyteros (rather than episkopos, </p>
<p>3:2).</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> Elders have a governing or management and organization role.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>they do a good job, they should be nancially honored,</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>and especially if</p>
<p>they work at teaching the word.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>Good teaching is especially important</p>
<p>in a church with heterodoxy.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>In addition, teaching requires preparation.</p>
<p>Honor signifying recompense is clearly indicated by the two quotations </p>
<p>that follow and explain the reason for paying teaching and ruling elders. </p>
<p>When Paul refers to the Scripture in the singular, he refers to spe-</p>
<p>cic quotations from the Pentateuch (Gen, Exod, Deut), historical nar-</p>
<p>rative (1 Kgs), and the prophets.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>In every reference, he treats the Old</p>
<p>Testament as authoritative and reliable.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy 5:18, he refers to</p>
<p>two passages that have a similar message.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p> e rst passage is Deuter-</p>
<p>onomy 25:4. Paul also cites it in 1 Corinthians 9:9 as a basis for paying </p>
<p>wages to a Christian worker. Bous (ox or “cattle”) were important for </p>
<p>farming (e.g., Gen 26:14), pulling wagons (2 Sam 6:6), eating (e.g., Gen </p>
<p>18:7; Deut 14:4), and sacricing.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>Like humans, they were to rest on the</p>
<p>Sabbath and those not one’s own were not to be coveted (Deut 5:14, 21). </p>
<p>Since an ox was strong (Prov 14:4), it was able to pull the threshing sled </p>
<p>over the grain.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> It could eat grass, straw, or stalks.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>When an ox works,</p>
<p>it should be fed, even if by feeding it, the ox would slow its work in order </p>
<p>to nourish itself. Analogously, if elders were indeed working, they too </p>
<p>should be nourished by being honored (5:17). Paul next cites worthy is </p>
<p>71. See Titus 1:5, 7. Acts 20:17, 28; 1 Pet 5:1–2.</p>
<p>72. Const. ap. 2.28 compares the teaching elders to the Sanhedrin.</p>
<p>73. See 1 Tim 3:4–5.</p>
<p>74. See 1 Tim 5:3.</p>
<p>75. Literally, “laboring in word and teaching,” but the phrase may be better </p>
<p>rendered as a hendiadys with didaskalia modifying logos.</p>
<p>76. See 1 Tim 3:2; Gal 6:6.</p>
<p>77. Rom 4:3; 9:17; 10:11; 11:2; Gal 3:8, 22; 4:30.</p>
<p>78. See 1 Tim 4:13; 2 Tim 3:16.</p>
<p>79. He appears to use similar reasoning to Hillel’s “a main proposition from two </p>
<p>scriptural passages” (Schürer 1979, 2:344).</p>
<p>80. E.g., Lev 1:2–3; John 2:14–15.</p>
<p>81. IDB 3:614; Mounce 2000: 310; Montague 2008: 113–14 vs. Marshall 1999: </p>
<p>615-the ox trampled the corn with its hooves.</p>
<p>82. Num 22:4; Ps 105:20 LXX; Isa 11:7.</p>
