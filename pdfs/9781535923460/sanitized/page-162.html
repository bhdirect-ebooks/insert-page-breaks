<p>jealousy” of Jesus’ popularity.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Envy describes what non-Christians may</p>
<p>feel (Titus 3:3), one result of not worshiping the Creator (Rom 1:28–29), </p>
<p>and one of the works of the esh (Gal 5:18–20, 26).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Battles result in envy</p>
<p>or malice towards others, not gentleness (1 Tim 6:11). Eris (contention)</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is a synonym for arguments (zētēsis) highlighting the inciting to battle. </p>
<p>One of the devious means to win battles is slander (blasphēmia, 6:4), to </p>
<p>insult and speak falsely.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Slander thus is very close in meaning to evil</p>
<p>suspicions or “evil opinions.” Jesus ben Sirach thinks an evil suspicion </p>
<p>can overthrow one’s judgment (Sir 3:24). Paratribō, the root stem of </p>
<p>diaparatribē (constant irritations), signies “rub beside or alongside.” </p>
<p>Heightened by dia (“through”), diaparatribē refers to attacks of “constant </p>
<p>argumentativeness” that “rub” or “clash against” one another and there-</p>
<p>fore are “irritating.”</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All this ghting occurs among people described in three phrases </p>
<p>(corrupted in mind and robbed of the truth, thinking godliness to be </p>
<p>a means of gain, 6:5). Diaphtheirō (corrupted) refers literally in the New </p>
<p>Testament to the physical destruction of an outer garment (Luke 12:33), </p>
<p>of a human body (2 Cor 4:16), and of ships (Rev 8:9). Here the mind, </p>
<p>“the faculties of perceiving and understanding and those of feeling, judging, </p>
<p>determining,”</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> has been destroyed. Apostereō signies to rob by com-</p>
<p>mitting fraud, not paying a debt, or doing another breach of condence </p>
<p>perpetuated for prot.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>us, the truth was not simply rejected, it was</p>
<p>deceitfully taken away from them. e current enticement for the teach-</p>
<p>ers is thinking that godliness</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>is a means of gain, a means of livelihood,</p>
<p>a way to earn a living, or procure money.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>11. Matt 27:18; Mark 15:10. e devil, according to the author of the Wisdom of </p>
<p>Solomon, was envious of humanity being created immortal in God’s image (2:23–24).</p>
<p>12. Gal 5 also mentions contention (eris), anger, quarrels, and drunkenness (vv. </p>
<p>20–21). </p>
<p>13. See Titus 3:9.</p>
<p>14. See 1 Tim 1:13.</p>

<p>18. See Titus 1:1; 1 Tim 1:3–4, 6–7; 4:7.</p>
<p>19. LSJ, 1450. Financial gain is the same motivation in Crete (Titus 1:10–11). </p>
