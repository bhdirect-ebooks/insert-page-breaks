<p>Pornos refers to people guided by their own</p>
<p>physical pleasure.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>e Jerusalem council highlighted porneia as one of</p>
<p>three things Gentile Christians should guard against (Acts 15:20). e </p>
<p>remedy is self-control and the opposite is the fruit of the Spirit.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Arsenokoitēs (1:10) refers to a male who engages in anal intercourse </p>
<p>primarily with a person of his own sex (rarely a male with a female).</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>It is</p>
<p>a more specic term than pornos. e term probably alludes to Leviticus </p>
<p>18:22 and 20:13. Here Paul may be referring to the sexual confusion in </p>
<p>the worship of Artemis in Ephesus, including among the eunuch priests.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Paul had spent two years in Rome and most likely had become </p>
<p>knowledgeable about Emperor Nero. is one man had committed near-</p>
<p>ly every sin listed in these verses. He murdered his mother Agrippina </p>
<p>and his wife Octavia (Josephus, Ant. 20.8 [153]). He would kill men as a </p>
<p>game, dropping their bodies down the sewers. He had gluttonous feasts </p>
<p>that lasted from noon until midnight, set up temporary brothels along </p>
<p>the shore whenever he oated down the Tiber to Ostia, and seduced boys </p>
<p>and married women. He even raped the Vestal Virgin Rubria. Having </p>
<p>tried to turn the boy Sporus into a girl by castration, he went through a </p>
<p>wedding ceremony with him. He practiced every kind of obscenity. He </p>
<p>ended up killing every member of his family and countless innocent oth-</p>
<p>ers (Suetonius, Nero 26–29, 33-37). His degradation became so legendary </p>
<p>that grati about him appeared on the city walls: “Nero, his own mother, </p>
<p>murdered” (Nero 39). Nero denitely deserved the law to convict him of </p>
<p>sin and punish him for his crimes.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>Such destructive actions contrast with healthy maturing growth. </p>
<p>Healthy teaching</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>is in conformity with the glorious gospel of the</p>
<p>blessed God with which I myself was entrusted (1:11).</p>

<p>Paul’s specic</p>
<p>82. 1 Cor 5:9–11; 6:9; Gal 5:19–21; Eph 5:5; Rev 21:8; 22:15.</p>
<p>83. See also 1 Cor 6:13. </p>
<p>84. 1 ess 4:3–6; Gal 5:19–23.</p>
<p>85. It is formed from arsēn (“male”) and koitē (“bed”) BDAG, 135; Kroeger n.d.; </p>
<p>Polycarp, Phil 5.3; Belleville 2009: 33–34.</p>
<p>86. Bennett 1967: 37–39; Kroeger 1992: 193–96. See also Rom 1:26–27.</p>
<p>87. See Rom 7:7; 1 Cor 15:56.</p>
<p>88. See Titus 1:13.</p>
<p>89. e glorious gospel is opposed to being in conformity with the unlawful use of </p>
<p>the law (1:8). “Sound” has become a dead metaphor for many today, connoting “dead” </p>
<p>orthodoxy (hygiainō and hygiēs are used literally in Luke 7:10; John 5:6). However, </p>
<p>Paul uses a metaphor in the present participle (1:10; 6:3) to highlight teaching which </p>
