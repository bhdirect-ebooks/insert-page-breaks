<p>Inner issues need to be worked on so as to gain conﬁdence in</p>
<p>oneself to be better able to please God and not simply other people. Pastors </p>
<p>need to protect themselves and be honest with themselves and, humbly, to </p>
<p>seek help when necessary. Prayer and God’s word are also important in order </p>
<p>to draw close to God, to cultivate a listening ear for God’s direction, and to </p>
<p>live out God’s word.</p>
<p> The Rev. Paul Bricker</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>cultivates his gift of evangelism by following</p>
<p>the book of Jude because it teaches evangelism at its heart. For example, </p>
<p>one must not “contend for the faith” (Jude 3) by being contentious. Rather, </p>
<p>evangelists must keep themselves in the love of God (v. 21). Three parti-</p>
<p>ciples explain how to keep oneself in God’s love: “building yourselves up </p>
<p>in your most holy faith,” “praying in the Holy Spirit,” and “waiting for the </p>
<p>mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ for eternal life” (vv. 20–21). Out of this </p>
<p>heart of love, the evangelist has mercy on those who are wavering and saves </p>
<p>others by snatching them out of the ﬁre, while even hating their “deﬁled </p>
<p>tunics” (sins) (vv. 22–23).</p>
<p>126</p>
<p> The challenge to keep oneself in God’s love in-</p>
<p>cludes battling against false thoughts. Jude, like Timothy, is trying to reach </p>
<p>those who are apostate from the church. The evangelist is a host who offers </p>
<p>God’s love.</p>
<p>Paul continues with commands to Timothy but now more focused </p>
<p>on his role as a pastor at Ephesus: You should not chastise an elder but </p>
<p>appeal to him as a father, younger ones (males) as brothers, elders </p>
<p>(females) as mothers, younger ones (females) as sisters in all purity </p>
<p>(5:1–2). Paul concludes his personal admonitions to Timothy with obser-</p>
<p>vations on how to relate to others of dierent ages and gender. Epiplēssō </p>
<p>has a basic physical signicance (literally, “to strike upon, beat upon”), </p>
<p>which developed into the metaphorical “punish, chastise, esp. with </p>
<p>words, rebuke, reprove”</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>(5:1). Timothy should not reprimand but instead</p>
<p>appeal to (parakaleō) (not command) people to do something good, to </p>
<p>watch out for wrong teaching and behavior, and to change behavior.</p>

<p>126. Zech 8:23 is another helpful passage showing that people are attracted to be-</p>
<p>lievers if they observe that “God is with you.”</p>
