<p>1 Timothy 2–372</p>
<p>he was doing. In Romans 5:12–21 and 1 Corinthians 15:22, Adam is sig-</p>
<p>nicant for what he brought into the world—death. All humans die and </p>
<p>live in a world of death and suering because Adam sinned and brought </p>
<p>death into the world.</p>
<p>164</p>
<p>Adam contrasts with Christ whose death brings</p>
<p>life to all (Rom 5:17–21; 1 Cor 15:22).</p>
<p>Paul uses two synonyms for deceive (apataō and exapataō [2:14]). </p>
<p>He adds the intensifying (perfective) preposition ek to apataō to indicate </p>
<p>Eve was deceived “thoroughly.”</p>
<p>165</p>
<p>As a result of being thoroughly misled</p>
<p>by falsehoods, she came to a state of transgression (2:14). Paul uses the </p>
<p>perfect tense of ginomai (“become”). Usually, the perfect has an exten-</p>
<p>sive force, presenting a completed state or condition. It “begins with the </p>
<p>punctiliar and goes on with the durative.”</p>
<p>166</p>
<p>God did not create Eve in a</p>
<p>state of transgression. Her act of eating the forbidden fruit aected her </p>
<p>state or condition. Genesis, later, narrates the progressive eects of her </p>
<p>and Adam’s sin.</p>
<p>Paul describes Eve’s sin as transgression (2:14, parabasis). In the </p>
<p>New Testament, parabasis and parabatēs refer to the breaking of God’s </p>
<p>laws.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p>e law indicates what one should do. “Transgression” (literally</p>
<p>“going aside” or “going over”)</p>
<p>168</p>
<p>is not going along with the law, but,</p>
<p>rather, going aside it, disobeying the law. Paul does not say Eve became a </p>
<p>“transgressor” (parabatēs), which would have more easily t in this sen-</p>
<p>tence. e focus is not so much who she became (a “transgressor”) but </p>
<p>rather the state or condition in which she entered, a state of deviation or </p>
<p>violation of the law. She “went aside” from the true path to a false path.</p>
<p>How then does the illustration of Eve relate to the women at Ephe-</p>
<p>sus? e women at Ephesus were reminiscent of the woman in Eden: Eve. </p>
<p>e Ephesian women who were learning a body of heretical beliefs and </p>
<p>teaching it to others, submitted to heterodox teachers that brought spiri-</p>
<p>tual death to their listeners. Eve, too, had in her time been deceived into </p>
<p>believing certain heterodox teachings: if she touched the fruit of the tree </p>
<p>of the knowledge of good and evil, she would become like God, yet she </p>
<p>would not die. She authoritatively passed on her teachings to Adam. Her </p>
<p>eating the fruit symbolized her “belief.” Sadly, he learned. He too ate the </p>
<p>164. Paul’s view contrasts with Sir 25:24: through “the woman ... we all die.”</p>
