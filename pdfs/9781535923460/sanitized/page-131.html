<p>Timothy Should Become an Example (4:11—5:2) 115</p>
<p>(4:13, 16): While I am coming, keep on occupying yourself in reading, </p>
<p>in encouragement, in teaching (4:13). </p>
<p>Paul again refers to time (while I am coming), as he did ear-</p>
<p>lier (“while hoping to come to you shortly,” 3:14, and “as I urged you </p>
<p>to remain longer while I was going into Macedonia,” 1:3). Apparently, </p>
<p>Timothy was eager for Paul to join him there in Ephesus, but Paul had </p>
<p>to encourage him to wait. In the meantime, Timothy must nd a way to </p>
<p>deal with some people at Ephesus who have been occupying themselves </p>
<p>(prosechō)</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>in wrong ways: with myths and endless genealogies which</p>
<p>give rise to speculations, drinking a lot of wine, with deceitful spirits and </p>
<p>demonic teachings (1:4; 3:8; 4:1). In contrast, they should have been oc-</p>
<p>cupying themselves with “stewardship” of God’s household (1:4). In 4:13, </p>
<p>Paul presents three equally important ways for Timothy to occupy his </p>
<p>time. e rst way is to read. Anagnōsis (noun) and anaginōskō (verb) </p>
<p>usually referred to the reading of the Old Testament, but it could include </p>
<p>reading of an inscription (John 19:20) or of an authoritative letter.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>It</p>
<p>could be a public reading of Scripture in a service</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>or the recitation of</p>
<p>Scripture (Luke 10:26) or a private reading of Scripture (Acts 8:28–33). </p>
<p>e dierence between public and private reading was slight since even </p>
<p>private reading was done out loud.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>us, in the context of 1 Timothy</p>
<p>4:11–12, reading probably refers to both private and public reading of </p>
<p>Scripture, which might include Paul’s letters.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>Since Timothy was to be</p>
<p>an example (4:12), he would want to exemplify what he will teach others </p>
<p>to do (4:11).</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>Encouragement (paraklēsis, parakaleō) is a regular part of the </p>
<p>ministry of elders and pastoral leaders.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>It can refer to appealing to (as</p>
<p>opposed to commanding or rebuking)</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>someone to do something good</p>
<p>or to change behavior. It can also include support of someone. Both in </p>
<p>92. See 1 Tim 4:1.</p>
<p>93. Acts 15:31; 23:34; 2 Cor 1:13; Eph 3:4; Col 4:16; 1 ess 5:27; Rev 1:3.</p>
<p>94. Acts 13:15, 27; 2 Cor 3:14–15; Luke 4:16; Deut 31:11–12; Josh 8:34–35; Neh </p>
<p>8:7–8.</p>
<p>95. Philip could hear the Ethiopian treasurer reading Isaiah (Acts 8:30).</p>
<p>96. Col 4:16; 1 ess 2:13; 5:27.</p>
<p>97. In 2 Tim 3:15–17 he will give a fuller description of the value of Scripture.</p>
<p>98. See Titus 2:15; Titus 1:9; 2:6; 1 Tim 6:2.</p>
<p>99. 1 Tim 5:1; 1 Cor 16:12.</p>
