<p>become a type of idol.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even in the Old Testament, God</p>
<p>continued to be called the King. is is what the prophet Isaiah called </p>
<p>God when he saw the Lord, “the King, the Lord of hosts” “sitting on a </p>
<p>throne” (Isa 6:1, 5).</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>Other Jews would also describe God as King, as did</p>
<p>the Sanhedrin court when it admonished witnesses: “e King of kings, </p>
<p>the Holy One, blessed is he, has stamped every man with the seal of the </p>
<p>rst man, yet not one of them is like his fellow” (m. Sanh. 4:5). Rabbi </p>
<p>Akabya ben Mahalaleel, a contemporary of Paul, advised, know “‘before </p>
<p>whom thou art about to give account and reckoning’—before the King of </p>
<p>kings, the Holy One, blessed is he” (m. ‘Abot 3:1).</p>
<p>135</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 1 Timothy, Paul reminded his listeners that God is the unique </p>
<p>Ruler-one who lasts forever (Ruler of the ages), is not mortal, not being </p>
<p>seen, the only God, who deserves eternal honor (1:17). Aphthartos (im-</p>
<p>perishable) signies not liable to decay, unlike an athlete’s crown (1 Cor </p>
<p>9:25). Opposite would be the idols created by humans (Rom 1:23), such </p>
as Artemis of Ephesus, or the emperors who were declared to be divine,
<p>such as Octavius Augustus (Luke 2:1), whom the Roman Senate decreed </p>
<p>at his death in A.D. 14 a god of the State.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p> </p>
<p>God’s everlasting power and deity are invisible (aoratos), yet they </p>
<p>are reected in the world God created (Rom 1:20). e marvel has been </p>
<p>that the invisible God, who is Spirit and cannot be seen, has become </p>
<p>visible in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>In particular, in 1 Timothy, God’s attribute of</p>
<p>compassion became visible through God’s compassionate treatment of </p>
<p>Paul (1:15–16).</p>

<p>Christmas is for many people a time of great physical, emotional, and ﬁ-</p>
<p>nancial stress.</p>

<p>Paul explains a major reason why Jesus came to earth. He</p>

<p>tus (OCD, 729). Ephesus, as a leading city, was given authority in 29 B.C. by Emperor </p>
<p>Octavius to set up a sanctuary dedicated to the cult of Roma and to his deied father, </p>
<p>Julius Caesar (Mitchell 1993: 100).</p>
