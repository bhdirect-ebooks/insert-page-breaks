<p>1 Timothy 5:3—6:2132</p>
<p>lead to turning away aer Satan (5:15)? Most likely, the women were </p>
<p>returning back to the addictive practice of magic. “Magic” (periergos) </p>
<p>is the same Greek word in Acts 19:19 and 1 Timothy 5:13. As a plural </p>
<p>noun, it refers to the “curious arts, magic.”</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>Curiosity can be a positive or</p>
<p>negative trait. It is negative when it leads inquiring minds</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> into search-</p>
<p>ing out areas of which there is no necessity. e appeal of magic is to </p>
<p>an unhealthy curiosity, a kind of spiritual meddling,</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>in contrast to the</p>
<p>Magi whose study of the stars was a healthy and productive curiosity </p>
<p>that led them to the incarnate God (Matt 2:1–11). At Crete there were </p>
<p>also those who taught with words devoid of truth what was not neces-</p>
<p>sary (Titus 1:10–11). Emptiness and curiosity can lead to Satan lling </p>
<p>up the empty minds (5:15).</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>Were these women attracted to magic or</p>
<p>were they actually practicing it? Verse 15 suggests that some but not all </p>
<p>had turned away aer Satan. Kroeger reminds us that “Magic spells, </p>
<p>charms, enchantments, and curses were widely employed in the ancient </p>
<p>w o r l d .”</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>Possibly, the Jewish myths included some syncretistic version of</p>
<p>the six Ephesian letters,</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>such as this prayer that combined elements of</p>
<p>paganism, Christianity, and Judaism: “Of Jesus Christ, son of Iaō, quickly, </p>
<p>quickly, heal! John, Son, Life.”</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>Paul ends with two summaries, one for the younger widows and </p>
<p>one for the widows’ family: erefore, I want younger ones to marry, </p>
<p>to bear children, to rule their households, to give no occasion to the </p>
<p>Adversary because of reproach; for already some have turned away </p>
<p>aer Satan. If any believer has widows, let her help them and not let </p>
<p>the church be burdened, in order that it might help the real widows </p>
<p>(5:14–16). What can the younger widows do to keep from nullifying their </p>
<p>vows, from being idle, and from being attracted to what is not neces-</p>
<p>sary (5:11–13)? Paul recommends four interrelated actions to keep the </p>
<p>women from condemnation from God and from the adversary. Marry-</p>
<p>ing and having children are wholesome and to be armed as gis from </p>
<p>God. God blessed humankind by calling it to “bear fruit and become </p>
