<p>Introduction to 1 and 2 Timothy 16</p>
<p>Pausanias mentions that the priestesses and priests of the Ephesian </p>
<p>Artemis live in purity for a year “not only sexual but in all respects, and </p>
<p>they neither wash nor spend their lives as do ordinary people, nor do </p>
<p>they enter the home of a private man.”</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>Strabo describes the priests</p>
<p>(Megabyzi, literally “set free by God”</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>) as “eunuchs” who are held in </p>
<p>great honor. Maidens (virgins) served as colleagues with them in their </p>
<p>priestly oce.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>us, scholars today are unclear whether the “eunuchs”</p>
<p>simply were not sexually active for a year or they castrated themselves.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But, they would model a celibate religious lifestyle in honor of the virgin </p>
<p>goddess.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>e temple of Artemis was the general bank or depository of Asia. </p>
<p>Oen private citizens deposited their money there. Others donated gis </p>
<p>to the goddess.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>Acts records the silversmith Demetrius reminding his</p>
<p>fellow artisans that “we get our wealth from this business” and, when </p>
<p>Paul persuaded “a considerable number of people” that gods made with </p>
<p>human hands were not real, their businesses would be aected (Acts </p>
<p>19:25–26). e wealth of the area resulted in a reputation for luxury </p>
<p>garments. Athenaeus repeats Democritus’ boast that the Ephesians were </p>
<p>devoted to luxury.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>Ephesus also became a center for shipbuilding and</p>
<p>trade. e temple was as well an asylum for the innocent.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>However, there was an underside to the religion of the Ephesian Ar-</p>
<p>temis. Jerome notes that Paul wrote to Diana at Ephesus at: “the chief city </p>
<p>of Asia where idolatry and the deceptions of the magicians’ arts which </p>
<p>always accompany idolatry thrived ... ey, whom the error of demons </p>
<p>had so long held and who knew that there are spiritual beings and pow-</p>
ers and who had perceived a certain likeness of divinity in organs and
<p>(Oec. 7.33–35) uses the queen bee as an example for a wife.</p>

<p>28. Kroeger, “God/dess” 1995: 58. Bennett (1967: 19–20, 38–39) adds that eemi-</p>
<p>nate priests and sex confusion were part of the rites of Artemis at Ephesus. See also </p>

<p>29. “Virgin” may simply refer to being unmarried. Sex is prohibited only between </p>
<p>husband and wife (Ramsay 1895, 1:95, 136). Married women were not allowed in the </p>
<p>temple of Artemis (Strelan 1996: 73, 120).</p>

<p>temis was called “savior” because her temple was a place of refuge (Hemer 1986: 48).</p>
