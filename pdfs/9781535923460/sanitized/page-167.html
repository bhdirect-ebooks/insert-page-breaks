<p>Heterodox Teaching versus Piety with Contentment (6:3–10) 151</p>
<p>and destructive (Luke 21:34–35). An animal might fall unawares into a </p>
<p>pit because it was covered by a camouaged net (or trap) (Job 18:8). A </p>
<p>bird, attracted by the bait, might “y into” a net, which entraps it (6:9). </p>
<p>e temptation is the bait. </p>
<p>Desires refer to strong feelings and passions turned upon some-</p>
<p>thing. A desire can be good and wise (like desiring to be an overseer [1 </p>
<p>Tim 3:1]) or foolish and harmful.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>Since desires can include wanting or</p>
<p>coveting what belongs to another,</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>possibly desires to be wealthy include</p>
<p>wanting more than one’s due, like the rich farmer who wanted to keep </p>
<p>more than his share of the crop (Luke 12:16–20). ese desires are fool-</p>
<p>ish and harmful. ese desires drag the entrapped humans to the bottom </p>
<p>of the pit into ruin and destruction.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>Ruin (elethros) can refer to painful</p>
<p>experiences, like labor pains and even hell, the total removal of God’s </p>
<p>presence.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>Destruction (apōleia) can also refer to hell and judgment, the</p>
<p>opposite of salvation and life.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul further explains why desiring to be rich is harmful: For the</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> </p>
<p>root of all kinds of evils is the love of money, by which some, reach-</p>
<p>ing aer, have been led astray from the faith, and pierce themselves </p>
<p>through by many sorrows (6:10).</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>is trap began with an underground</p>
<p>root which grows into a shoot.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> A root goes deep and sustains a plant.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the root is not holy, the branches are not holy.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>is root is not Jesus</p>
<p>Christ.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> It is the love of money, the love of “silver” (argyros).</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>Silver was</p>
<p>caught” (ayer, 472). Prov 6:5; 7:23; Eccl 9:12. See IDB 4: 688. One trap has to do </p>
<p>with reproach from outsiders (1 Tim 3:7). </p>
<p>42. See Titus 2:12; 3:3 and 2 Tim 2:22; 3:6; 4:3.</p>
<p>43. Rom 7:7; Exod 20:17; Deut 5:21.</p>
<p>44. Ruin and destruction is a pleonasm—two synonyms that highlight one point.</p>
<p>45. 1 ess 5:3; 2 ess 1:9.</p>
<p>46. Matt 7:13; Phil 1:28; 3:19; 2 ess 2:3; Heb 10:39; 2 Pet 3:7.</p>
<p>47. According to Colwell’s rule, although root has no article, it is denite.</p>
<p>48. See novel by McKinnery, Abracadaver, where the motive for murder is greed. </p>
<p>e murderer dies by a spike as in 1 Tim 6:10.</p>
