<p>1 TIMOTHY 4:1—5:2</p>
<p>Timothy Should Teach the Words of the Faith, </p>
<p>Setting an Example</p>
<p>De (but, 4:1) introduces a contrast with the preceding verses: But the </p>
<p>Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart for themselves </p>
<p>from the faith paying attention to deceitful spirits and demonic teach-</p>
<p>ings, as</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>hypocritical liars, their own conscience branded with a hot</p>
<p>iron, forbidding to marry, to abstain from foods, which God created </p>
<p>for reception with thanksgiving by the believers and those who have </p>
<p>known fully the truth, since every created thing of God is good and </p>
<p>nothing is rejected, being received with thanksgiving, for it is ren-</p>
<p>dered holy (sanctied) through God’s word and intercession (4:1–5). </p>
<p>Aer explaining various ways to help people to be saved and come to the </p>
<p>knowledge of the truth (1:3—3:16), Paul now further explains the ur-</p>
<p>gency of the matter. In chapter 1, Paul had highlighted heterodox teach-</p>
<p>ings at Ephesus related to “myths and genealogies,” misuse of the law, and </p>
<p>misinformed teachers (1:4, 7–11). Now he describes what will happen </p>
<p>and is happening in general.</p>
<p>Heterodoxy Was Predicted by the Spirit (4:1–5)</p>
<p>Paul’s source is the Spirit. Paul mentions the Holy Spirit in every one of </p>
<p>his letters as one Person of the Trinity.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>When Ananias prayed for him</p>
<p>at Damascus, Paul was lled with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit </p>
<p>continued to dwell within him. In the midst of evil and persecution, the </p>
<p>Holy Spirit’s presence became intensive. During Paul’s journeys, the Holy </p>
<p>Spirit encouraged, led, testied to, and restrained Paul and his cowork-</p>
<p>ers.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>In Acts, the Holy Spirit also explicitly spoke to Peter, the church in</p>
<p>1. “As” or “in the form of” (BDAG, 329–30).</p>
<p>2. See Titus 3:4–7.</p>
<p>3. E.g., 2 Tim 1:14; Acts 9:17, 31; 13:9, 52; 16:6–7; 20:22–23; 21:4.</p>
