<p>1 Timothy 2–362</p>
<p>indicative rst person singular in 1 Timothy, he appears to describe an </p>
<p>action that he is encouraging Timothy to do now. Sometimes the present </p>
<p>active indicative rst person singular simply describes what Paul himself </p>
<p>is doing at that moment: “I am entrusting, I am encouraging, I am want-</p>
<p>ing, I am writing, I am coming.”</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>Along with his self-description comes</p>
<p>an implied action that Paul wants from Timothy at the present time. For </p>
<p>example, he is giving this “order” to Timothy to do at this time (1:18), he </p>
<p>is encouraging prayer at this time to help the Christians have a quiet life </p>
<p>(2:1–2), he wants the men not to quarrel while praying, a problem they </p>
<p>had at this time (2:8), he is writing now with the expectation of coming </p>
<p>later (3:14). us, in the same manner, this restriction related to women </p>
<p>teaching will not always apply.</p>
<p>e verb permit (epitrepō) is not that frequent in the New Testa-</p>
<p>ment.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p> In the New Testament, it refers not to commands, but to allow-</p>
<p>able acts, analogous to God’s permissive will as opposed to God’s perfect </p>
<p>(and proactive) will. For example, Jesus said that Moses “permitted you </p>
to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this
<p>way from the beginning” (Matt 19:8 TNIV).</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>At times, it is a term of</p>
<p>polite conversation: “First allow me to say farewell” (Luke 9:61). It is also </p>
<p>used for obtaining a governmental allowance to do a certain act, as when </p>
<p>Pilate permitted Joseph to take Jesus’ body (John 19:38).</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>us, it is not</p>
<p>so much that Paul commands</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>women not to teach, but that they do not</p>
<p>have his permission at this time. </p>
<p>Paul also does not permit a woman to domineer over (authenteō) </p>
<p>a man, but to be in silence (2:12b). Volumes have been written on </p>
<p>authenteō.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>Verbs of ruling such as authenteō take the genitive, therefore,</p>
<p>advice or position for a situation that is not universal. “e ongoing sense of the pres-</p>
<p>ent tense verb is to be noted” (Belleville 2009: 57). Porter (1992: 21, 29) agrees that the </p>
<p>present indicative indicates action in progress. While Campbell (2008: 13, 63) writes </p>
<p>that to state that 2:12 refers to “an action in progress” is “erroneous,” yet he states that </p>
<p>the present tense-forms “oen” depict “a process or action in progress.” </p>
<p>113. See 1 Tim 1:18; 2:1, 8; 4:13; 5:1, 13, 14, 21; 6:13. Mounce (2000: 122) reduces </p>
<p>this argument to the present tense. However, my comment refers to the rst person </p>
<p>singular present indicative. Nevertheless, even statements in the rst person singular </p>
<p>present indicative may apply today, but only to analogous situations.</p>
<p>114. 18 refs., 3 times by Paul.</p>
<p>115. Also Mark 5:13; Luke 8:32; 1 Cor 16:7; Heb 6:3. 1 Cor 14:34 appears to t in </p>
<p>this category although the “law” is unclear.</p>
<p>116. Acts 21:39–40; 26:1; 27:3; 28:16; Esth 9:14; 1 Macc 15:6.</p>
<p>117. E.g., parangellō: 1 Tim 4:11; 5:7; 6:17.</p>
<p>118. Sanford Hull lists the many exegetical diculties in 1 Tim 2:8–15 (Hull 1987: </p>
<p>259–65). TLG lists no verb forms of authentein before the third century A.D. L&amp;N, </p>
