<p>1 TIMOTHY 2–3</p>
<p>Peaceable Prayer, Education, and Leadership</p>
<p>Paul’s appeal</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> in 2:1 (therefore) alludes to an “order” to Timothy in chap-</p>
<p>ter 1 (1:18).</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Paul’s appeal in chapter 2 has to do with the nature and</p>
<p>consequent purpose of God. God is a savior God “who wants all humans </p>
<p>to be saved and to come into knowledge of truth” (2:3–4). If chapter 1 </p>
<p>(as regards the church) mainly deals with what they are not to do (teach </p>
<p>dierent doctrine), chapters 2–3 mainly deal with what they are to do. </p>
<p>In order that all may be saved and come to knowledge of the truth, </p>
<p>Paul promotes prayer that results in peace, peaceable prayer lifestyles, </p>
<p>peaceable learning, and godly leaders who promote peace with outsiders </p>
<p>(2:1—3:16).</p>
<p>Godly Peaceful Lives (2:1–15)</p>
<p>Paul has Timothy begin this process of leading people to salvation by </p>
<p>appealing to Timothy and the believers at Ephesus to pray: erefore, </p>
<p>I am encouraging you, rst of all, to make prayers for needs, rever-</p>
<p>ent prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings on behalf of all humans, on </p>
<p>behalf of rulers and all of the ones in a place of prominence, in order </p>
<p>that we may live a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and holiness </p>
<p>(2:1–2). </p>
<p>Prayer is rst in terms of importance and priority in time (2:1). </p>
<p>e Savior God must be active and present for salvation to occur. Prayer </p>
<p>is described in four of its aspects in a pleonasm.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>e noun dēesis and</p>
<p>verb deomai principally refer to petitionary prayer or a forceful urging in </p>
<p>regard to some need.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>ey can be used for humans communicating to</p>
<p>1. See Titus 2:15 on “appeal” (parakaleō).</p>
<p>2. See 1:18 internal summary.</p>
<p>3. “Pleonasm” is the repetition of synonyms for “prayer” for emphasis (Spencer </p>
<p>1998b: 203).</p>
<p>4. See Spencer 1990b: 112–15.</p>
