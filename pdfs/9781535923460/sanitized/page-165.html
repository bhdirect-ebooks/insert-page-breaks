<p>Heterodox Teaching versus Piety with Contentment (6:3–10) 149</p>
<p>his mother’s womb, he shall return back as he came” [5:14 LXX]).</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>Paul</p>
<p>contrasts we brought into (eispherō eis) with we take out (ekpherō). B<span class="_ _3" />oth<span class="_ _3" /> </p>
<p>at the entry and departure points do humans possess nothing.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>Second,</p>
<p>he reminds Timothy to be satised (arkeō) with food</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>and clothing</p>
<p>(6:8). </p>
<p>Skepasma (clothing) is literally “a covering.” e noun can refer to </p>
<p>provisions of clothing and house.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>Paul is thereby reminding Timothy</p>
<p>that the basic necessities of food, clothing, and shelter should serve to </p>
<p>leave one satised. Jesus had taught that “life is more than food (trophē) </p>
<p>and the body (more than) clothing” (Luke 12:23). For this reason, the </p>
<p>Father takes care of these necessities in the disciples so that they can con-</p>
<p>centrate on promoting God’s kingdom.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> </p>
<p>en Paul goes on to describe the dangers of pursuing the procur-</p>
<p>ing of money for its own sake: But the ones desiring to be rich fall into </p>
<p>temptation and a trap and many foolish and harmful desires, which </p>
<p>drag humans to the bottom into ruin and destruction (6:9). Aer hav-</p>
<p>ing explained why godliness with contentment is the right way to live </p>
<p>(6:6–8), Paul returns to those who use godliness as a means of nancial </p>
<p>enrichment (6:3–5), but now he focuses only on the nancial aspect. </p>
<p>ese people will include the false teachers (6:3–5), but also anyone who </p>
<p>keeps on desiring to be rich. </p>
<p>What does it mean to be rich? Joseph of Arimathea, called rich, </p>
<p>owned his own tomb. As a member of the Sanhedrin he was most likely </p>
<p>aristocratic.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>e rich are able to reciprocate another’s dinner invitation</p>
<p>(Luke 14:12). ey own property and could hire a manager to oversee </p>
<p>31. Eccl. 5:14 LXX has exerchomai and epistrephō.</p>
<p>32. He uses the aorist tense to describe the punctiliar action of birth, but the pres-</p>
<p>ent tense to describe the linear action of continually trying (dunamai) to take posses-</p>
<p>sions with us at death.</p>
<p>33. Trophē tends to refer to food in the N.T. Diatrophē (food) ap<span class="_ _1" />pears to be an </p>
<p>intensive form of trophē. For example, John the Baptist lived on locusts and wild honey </p>
<p>(Matt 3:4). Trophē can also refer more broadly to money, food, and clothing (Matt </p>
<p>10:9–11). e more intensive aspect of diatrophē (Robertson 1934: 581) is shown </p>
<p>when Bethsura had insucient food to resist an army because they were in the midst </p>
<p>of a sabbatical year (1 Macc 6:49). </p>
<p>34. It comes from skepazō (“to cover”) and skepē (“shade”). Skepazō refers to pro-</p>
<p>viding security, protection, and shelter (BDAG, 927); “clothing” (Aristotle, Pol. 7.15 </p>
<p>[1336a. 17]).</p>
<p>35. Luke 12:28–31; Matt 6:25–33.</p>
<p>36. Matt 27:57–59; Mark 15:43; Luke 23:50–51; IDB 4:216..</p>
