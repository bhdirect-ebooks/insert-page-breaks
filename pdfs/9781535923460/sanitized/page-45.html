<p>Excursus: Women Could Desire to Be Teachers 29</p>
<p>tunity for them. Of course, women could be taught and could teach the </p>
<p>Scriptures at home, as Lois and Eunice taught Timothy authoritatively the </p>
<p>Old Testament.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> However, Jewish women, unlike Jewish men, were not ob-</p>
<p>ligated to study rabbinic and Old Testament law, nor did they receive any </p>
<p>merit in studying the law, nor was anyone obligated to teach them. They </p>
<p>were exempt from any requirement which necessitated their leaving the </p>
<p>home for any period of time. They also did not participate in the synagogue </p>
<p>“House of Study,” which was a place for males only. They were regarded in </p>
<p>the same category in rabbinic laws as Gentiles and slaves.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>Wealthy Jewish</p>
<p>and Greek women would be encouraged to stay within the house, active in </p>
<p>the indoor life of household management.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>Among the Gentiles at Ephesus was a variety of educational expecta-</p>
<p>tions for women. Pre-historic Crete and Asia Minor had strong emphases on </p>
<p>matriarchy, as reﬂected in legends about the Amazon women, which may be </p>
<p>why Christian female elders taught in Crete.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>Women would participate in</p>
<p>the religious ceremonies of goddesses,</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>but probably not in actual physical</p>
<p>sacriﬁce.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> The Etruscan women, the initial residents of Italy who were con-</p>
<p>quered by the Romans, could take part in public events.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>The later Greek</p>
<p>and Roman times appear generally to have limited the public participation </p>
<p>of women. The Athenian Greeks and the Romans were both patriarchal.</p>
<p>But the Macedonian conquests by Alexander the Great had changed </p>
<p>and was still changing the role of women. Macedonian women gained more </p>
<p>social and legal rights than other Greek women, especially Athenian.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>As</p>
<p>a result, women in Hellenistic Egypt had many social and legal rights be-</p>
<p>cause Hellenistic queens were successors of the Macedonians. Thus, in </p>
<p>Hellenistic Greece, some women scholars and prose writers can be found </p>
<p>in Alexandria, as the Neopythagorean philosophers Perictione or Hypatia, </p>
<p>leader of the Neoplatonic School (fourth through ﬁfth century A.D.).</p>
