<p>1 Timothy 2–392</p>
<p>Both the overseer and the minister are to be not open to attack, </p>
<p>not loving money or fond of shameful gain, not given to getting drunk, </p>
<p>one-woman men, not new converts or untested, managing well house-</p>
<p>hold and children.</p>
<p>266</p>
<p>e overseer has almost twice as many required</p>
<p>attributes as the minister (14 vs. 8). In addition, the overseer must be </p>
<p>wise, well behaved, hospitable, apt in teaching, not pugnacious, gentle, </p>
<p>not contentious, and having a good testimony from outsiders. Many of </p>
<p>these qualities would help the overseer be well qualied to represent the </p>
<p>church to the outside world.</p>
<p>267</p>
<p>However, we can deduce that becoming</p>
<p>an overseer required the ability to teach others and develop traits (having </p>
<p>good behavior, hospitality, being gentle, and not contentious) that would </p>
<p>be especially helpful in interacting with the heretics. Diakonos does not </p>
<p>require the ability to teach others. us, it could refer to Christian leader-</p>
<p>ship in general or to the “ministry of ministry” in particular.</p>
<p>e women (3:11) are required to have almost identical virtues as </p>
<p>the ministers (3:8–10): Likewise (it is necessary) the women (minis-</p>
<p>ters) (to be) honorable,</p>
<p>268</p>
<p>not slanderers, sober, faithful in all (3:11).</p>
<p>Not being slanderers and not being double-tongued (3:8) are very close </p>
<p>in meaning, as also being faithful in all and having the mystery of the </p>
<p>faith in a clean conscience (3:9).</p>
<p>Although in 1 Timothy 3 overseer is singular (3:2), while minister is </p>
<p>plural (3:8, 12), in Acts 20:17, 28 a plural number of overseers (or elders) </p>
<p>represent Ephesus. Philippi also had a plural number of overseers and </p>
<p>ministers (Phil 1:1). Acts 14:23 also suggests a plural number of elders </p>
<p>were selected “in each church” (or “corresponding to each church”). Paul </p>
<p>seems to be using, therefore, the singular “overseer” in 1 Timothy 3:2 to </p>
<p>be presenting a more abstract generic idea (not because Ephesus has only </p>
<p>one overseer), while the plural “ministers” (3:8, 12) is more concrete.</p>
<p>269</p>
<p>No clear role is mentioned for ministers, except, like the overseer, </p>
<p>management (proistēmi) of children and household (3:12). Only the </p>
<p>minister is not to be double-tongued (dilogos, 3:8), “insincere,” “double </p>
<p>in speech,” “double-talking,” “saying one thing with one person, another </p>
<p>266. See Titus 1:6.</p>
<p>267. Kelly (1963: 73, 76) notes also that the overseer had charge of the church’s </p>
<p>external relations and as its representatives entertained visiting Christians. See Titus </p>
<p>1:8 and 1 Tim 3:15.</p>
<p>268. See Titus 2:2.</p>
<p>269. e use of the singular in v. 2. follows the use of the singular in 3:1. Titus 1 </p>
<p>also shis from plural to generic singular (1:5–7) (Fee 1988: 84; Kelly 1963: 74).</p>
