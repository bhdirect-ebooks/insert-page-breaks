<p>1 Timothy 2–352</p>
<p>times was a herald. As Philo explains: the herald’s sta is “an emblem </p>
<p>of covenants of reconciliation, for wars come to be suspended or ended </p>
<p>through heralds establishing peace; wars where no heralds are admitted </p>
<p>create endless calamities both for the assailants and the defenders.”</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>An</p>
<p>apostle, as an eyewitness of the resurrected Jesus, is a messenger sent o </p>
<p>by Jesus to represent Jesus, proclaiming God’s reign.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul reiterates the truth of his calling and message: (I speak truth, </p>
<p>I do not lie)</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>and adds a third role to herald and apostle: a teacher</p>
<p>of Gentiles in faith and truth (2:7). Teacher and “apostle” are two pri-</p>
<p>mary spiritual gis Paul uses for self-description.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>Although he baptizes</p>
<p>a few people, he does not dene himself as an evangelist (in contrast to </p>
<p>Timothy).</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>As a teacher (didaskalos), Paul instructs persons or causes</p>
<p>them to learn. e primary eect of the didaskalos is on “the intellect, </p>
<p>and someone qualied exercises the inuence.”</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>A didaskalos “teaches</p>
<p>denite skills.”</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>Jesus, when on earth, taught, preached, and healed (e.g.,</p>
<p>Matt 4:23). e twelve apostles also taught because teaching was one of </p>
<p>the ways in which the reign of God is furthered (Mark 6:30). According </p>
<p>to Jesus, the greatest person in God’s kingdom both obeys and teaches </p>
<p>others Jesus’ commands (Matt 5:19). Teaching is one aspect of making </p>
<p>disciples (Matt 28:19–20). Of course, true and false teaching is a major </p>
<p>problem at Ephesus</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>that Paul can address by being a teacher of truth</p>
<p>(2:7). </p>
<p>Paul’s primary focus is teaching Gentiles, as Ananias was told by the </p>
<p>Lord: Paul was his “chosen vessel ... to bring his name before Gentiles </p>
<p>and also rulers and people of Israel.”</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>e church at Ephesus most likely</p>
<p>had Gentiles and Jews. Even though Paul had to leave the synagogue </p>
<p>at Ephesus, he was heard by Jews and Gentiles throughout the area.</p>
