<p>1 Timothy 2–376</p>
<p>out of works, the ones in righteousness, which we ourselves prepared, </p>
<p>but according to his mercy” (Titus 3:5). Since Paul encouraged men and </p>
<p>women to devote themselves to the ministry as single, if they are not </p>
<p>tempted sexually (1 Cor 7:8–9; 1 Tim 5:3), why would he identify child-</p>
<p>bearing as a requirement for salavation for all women (married, single, </p>
<p>and barren)? A woman can be involved in childbearing and in all the </p>
<p>domestic motherly roles and still not be saved if she does not believe in </p>
<p>Jesus. (1 Tim 2:15 does not say a woman shall be saved through faith, love, </p>
<p>and holiness.) Schreiner concludes that women “will experience eschato-</p>
<p>logical salvation by adhering to their proper role, which is exemplied in </p>
<p>giving birth to children.”</p>
<p>180</p>
<p>But, do men experience salvation by adhering</p>
<p>to their proper role? Roles do not save; in contrast, Galatians 3:26—4:7 </p>
<p>teaches that male and female are one when it comes to faith and being </p>
<p>saved as heirs of Abraham.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I prefer the third interpretation because it ts </p>
<p>best in the context, the established meanings of the words, and harmo-</p>
<p>nizes with Paul’s other teachings, including those in the Pastorals.</p>
<p>181</p>
<p>Paul returns now to the plural number (they might remain, 2:15b) </p>
<p>because the analogy or illustration of Eve has concluded. If Eve was the </p>
<p>singular, who are the plural they? Certainly it includes the plural women </p>
<p>in the church (2:9–10), but it also applies to the orthodox teachers, in-</p>
<p>cluding Timothy, who will teach the women. Paul uses a conditional </p>
<p>(“third class”) clause indicating the condition has not happened, thus </p>
<p>some doubt is involved, but it has some expectation of realization. e </p>
<p>women already have faith, love, holiness, and wisdom, but they need to </p>
<p>persevere (remain)</p>
<p>182</p>
<p>in these virtues because they were saved in order</p>
<p>to develop these qualities of God’s character.</p>
<p>183</p>
<p>Why did Paul pick these</p>
<p>particular four qualities? Faith and love are important themes in the Pas-</p>
<p>torals (1 Tim 1:5).</p>
<p>184</p>
<p>From an educational perspective, faith describes</p>
<p>both the content of the message that Paul wants to impart and a means </p>

<p>181. For further examples, see Payne 2009: 421–22 n. 14. CEV has all renderings: </p>
<p>“brought safely through childbirth,” “saved by having children,” “saved by being good </p>
<p>mothers,” and “saved by the birth of a child” (that is, by the birth of Jesus).” See also </p>
<p>NLT.</p>
<p>182. Paul uses menō with the sense of “continue” or “persist” (e.g., Rom 9:11; 1 Cor </p>
<p>3:14; 7:8, 11, 20, 24, 40; 15:6).</p>
<p>183. See Titus 3:8. Christ is faithful; loving (1 Tim 1:14; 2 Tim 1:13); holy; and wise </p>
<p>(1 Cor 1:24, 30 sophia).</p>
<p>184. See 1 Tim 1:19.</p>
