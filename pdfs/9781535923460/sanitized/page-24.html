<p>Introduction to Pastoral Letters8</p>
<p>discusses how to baptize (ch. 7), when to fast (ch. 8), how to give the </p>
<p>eucharist and give grace (chs. 9–10, 14), and what criteria should be fol-</p>
<p>lowed for choosing bishops and deacons (ch. 15). e Didache is very </p>
<p>specic, for example, fast on Wednesdays and Fridays (8:1), whereas 1 </p>
<p>Timothy is more general (as in 1 Tim 2:8: the men should pray “liing </p>
<p>holy hands without quarreling”). Polycarp’s letter is much like all of the </p>
<p>New Testament letters, because he freely quotes them. Hanson claims </p>
<p>that 1 Timothy 6:6–10 reproduces popular philosophical maxims on </p>
<p>wealth, but his proof comes from the third to sixth century A.D.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What is the real concern? Paul now seems to want to please the </p>
<p>world more than before and he is concerned about orthodoxy and de-</p>
<p>clares clearly that Jesus is God. </p>
<p>Ecclesiological Reasons</p>
<p>Marxsen writes: “e tension of Christian existence in the new eschato-</p>
<p>logical situation has been abandoned in favour of a Christian adjustment </p>
<p>to this world.” Now there is an “emphasis on the idea of tradition,”</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>xed tradition. erefore, he concludes, Paul is claimed as author and </p>
<p>Christian doctrine is a “deposit.”</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>“Doctrine and oces are in harmony</p>
<p>with apostolic authority.”</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>e author appears not to argue with heretics</p>
<p>but simply to contrast false versus true teaching. “Good citizenship” is </p>
<p>key.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>e bishop, deacon, elder hierarchy is close to the episcopate of</p>
<p>the second century,</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>in contrast to Acts 14:23, where only elders are</p>
<p>mentioned. </p>
<p>However, the passing on of correct tradition has always been Paul’s </p>
<p>practice, as in 1 Corinthians 11:23: “I myself received (paralambanō) </p>
<p>from the Lord what also I delivered (paradidōmi) to you.” “Received” </p>
<p>and “delivered” are key words to describe the passing on of authoritative </p>
<p>teaching. In 1 Corinthians 15:3, Paul repeats: “For I delivered to you as </p>
<p>of rst importance, what I also received.” In Galatians 1:6, he is “aston-</p>
<p>ished” they are turning to a dierent gospel and in 2 Corinthians 11:4, the </p>

<p>even for his theory!</p>
