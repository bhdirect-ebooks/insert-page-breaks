<p>cism had appeal in Ephesus.</p>

<p>Would Timothy’s decision to drink wine</p>
<p>have a negative impact with the congregation? Witherington explains: </p>
<p>“e false teachers had been urging an inappropriate form of asceti-</p>
<p>cism that involved food and drink, and Paul did not want Timothy to </p>
<p>be caught in that trap.”</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Paul commands Timothy to use</p>
<p>a small amount of wine to prevent the physical illnesses that water was </p>
<p>perpetuating.</p>
<p>Paul then summarizes this section on elders: e sins of some hu-</p>
<p>mans are obvious, going before them into judgment, but to some hu-</p>
<p>mans also they follow; likewise also the good deeds of some humans </p>
<p>are obvious, and those having their good deeds otherwise cannot be </p>
<p>hid (5:24–25). Paul makes an analogy between doing evil and doing good </p>
<p>deeds. Some good actions, like evil actions, are obvious (prodēlos), while </p>
<p>other good or evil actions are more hidden. Eventually, both will become </p>
<p>as obvious as Peter’s accent was a Galilean one (Matt 26:73). Jesus too </p>
<p>told his disciples that the hypocrisy of the Pharisees hides their sins, but </p>
<p>eventually their sins will become manifest: “Nothing is covered up that </p>
<p>will not be uncovered, and nothing secret that will not become known. </p>
<p>erefore whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, </p>
<p>and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be proclaimed </p>
<p>from the housetops” (Luke 12:2–3 NRSV). us, Timothy needs to be </p>
<p>careful in prosecuting accusations (5:19) but also in approving people </p>
<p>who may appear to be godly, but are not really (5:22).</p>
<p>wine, while raw wheat, raw meat, and water would cause “severe suering” (Vet. med. </p>
<p>13 [10–23]). Sweet wine was used in medications that were drunk (Liq. 5 [129]); mild </p>
<p>white Mendean wines served as laxatives (Int. 13 [200], 16 [206]; for fevers, old a-</p>
<p>sian wine was diluted twenty-ve parts water and one part wine (Morb. 3. 17 [160]). </p>
<p>Wine in moderation can have health benets for some people for cardiovascular </p>
<p>health and other causes (Consumer Reports 1999: 10). Pliny also mentions the benet </p>
<p>of wine for cardiac disease. Bion (wine) was good for a “disordered stomach or a weak </p>
<p>digestion, for pregnancy, faintness, paralysis, trembling, giddiness, colic, and sciatica.” </p>
<p>Some wines helped fatigue aer military exercises (Nat. 23.25–26 [50–53]). Wine </p>
<p>can also serve as a remedy against dyspeptic complaints (Kelly 1963: 129). Ancient </p>
<p>physicians prescribed wine as a “remedy to facilitate digestion, combat anorexia, and </p>
<p>suppress stomach-rumblings” (TLNT 3:298–99); Marshall 1999: 623–24; NewDocs </p>
<p>6:190. Timothy was probably not a “semi-invalid” (Robertson 1931: 590) because he </p>
<p>exercised regularly (1 Tim 4:8) and traveled with Paul. He could have had intestinal or </p>
<p>stomach problems (TLNT 3: 298).</p>
<p>108. See 1 Tim 4:3. e “pious” might even point to priests being required to ab-</p>
<p>stain from wine while serving at the temple (Josephus, Ag. Ap. I [199]; Lev 10:9; Ezek </p>
<p>44:21.</p>
