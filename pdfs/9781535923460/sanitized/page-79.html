<p>Godly Peaceful Lives (2:1–15) 63</p>
<p>a man (anēr) is clearly its object. e diculty arises with interpretation </p>
<p>because this verb occurs nowhere else in the Bible. Although some schol-</p>
<p>ars have argued that authenteō has positive connotations (“to exercise au-</p>
<p>thority”), these positive connotations come from later ecclesiastical use </p>
<p>(A.D. 370 and later).</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> e noun cognate used by Jewish writers contem-</p>
<p>porary to Paul clearly has negative connotations. Josephus uses authentēs </p>
<p>to render “assassins” (murderers of Galilean Jew[s] on their way to a fes-</p>
<p>tival in Jerusalem). He describes Antipater, Herod’s son, as an authentēs </p>
<p>because he was accused of killing his family members.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>Philo describes</p>
<p>the person who has tried to destroy the virtues as his “own murderer” </p>
<p>(Worse 21 [78]). e Wisdom of Solomon describes bad parents as au-</p>
<p>thentai who “kill defenseless souls by their own hands” (12:6). Contem-</p>
<p>porary Roman writers also used authentēs with negative connotations. </p>
<p>e historian Appian (A.D. 95–165) used authentēs for “murderer.”</p>
<p>121</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Diodorus of Sicily also used authentēs in negative contexts: “the perpe-</p>
<p>trators of the sacrilege” and “the author of these crimes.”</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>Authenteō is</p>
<p>similar to the negative type of leadership Jesus portrays for the Gentile </p>
<p>rulers (archōn). eir leadership is described with two words katakurieuō </p>
<p>and katexousiazō (Matt 20:25), formed from the root preposition “under” </p>
<p>(kata), which vividly describes the position of the person being ruled. </p>
<p>Katakyrieuō signies to “exercise complete dominion.”</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>Katexousiazō</p>
<p>signies to wield “authority over” or “tyrannize” “over someone.”</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>Liddell</p>
<p>and Scott’s Lexicon agrees: authenteō signies “to have full power or au-</p>
<p>thority over,” “ commit a murder” and authentēs refers to a “murderer.”</p>
<p>125</p>
<p> </p>
<p>us, Paul would be prohibiting women from having absolute power </p>
<p>over men in such a way as to destroy them.</p>
<p>474 denes authenteō as “to control in a domineering manner.” See also Payne 2009: </p>
<p>361–73.</p>
<p>119. See the extensive discussion in Payne 2009: 361–92; Belleville 2005: 209–17; </p>

<p>120. J.W. 2.12 [232–40]; 1.30 [582].</p>
<p>121. Hist. rom.; Bell. civ. I.7.61; III.13.115; IV.17.134. </p>
<p>122. XVI.61.1; XVI.5.4. Some scholars have posited that the noun and verb have </p>
<p>dierent root meanings, e.g., Köstenberger &amp; Schreiner 2005: 45, 102. However, the </p>
<p>grammarian A. T. Robertson indicates that the verb authenteō comes from the noun </p>
<p>authentēs (1934: 147–48).</p>
<p>123. LSJ, 896.</p>
<p>124. LSJ, 924; BDAG, 531. Katakyrieuō is used of the demons who “<span class="_ _2" />overpower<span class="_ _1" />” the </p>
<p>Jewish exorcists so that they are le naked and wounded (Acts 19:16).</p>
