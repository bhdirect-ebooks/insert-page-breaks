<p>Godly Peaceful Lives (2:1–15) 67</p>
<p>years ago about women not teaching: “One feels somehow that some-</p>
<p>thing is not expressed here to make it all clear.” “One wonders if there </p>
<p>was not something known to Paul about special conditions in Corinth </p>
<p>and Ephesus that he has not told” because Paul’s armation of female </p>
<p>prophets in 1 Corinthians 11:5 “is not easy to reconcile” with “his de-</p>
<p>mand for silence by the women” in 1 Corinthians 14:34–40 and 1 Timo-</p>
<p>thy 2:8–15.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>Grenz summarizes: “Paul temporarily bars women from</p>
<p>teaching in keeping with the close connection he makes between pos-</p>
<p>sessing wisdom or knowledge and being actively involved in the teaching </p>
<p>and admonishing role in the church. at the ban will one day be lied, </p>
<p>however, is indicated by Paul’s instruction to Timothy to entrust sound </p>
<p>doctrine to persons who in turn could teach others.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Many commentators (egalitarians and hierarchalists) over the years </p>
<p>are agreed that 2:12 is dicult to understand. Many have come to ap-</p>
<p>preciate that for Christian women to learn in silence (2:11) is an exem-</p>
<p>plary virtue for all Christians. Many have also recognized that women </p>
<p>were in some way promulgating or at least participating in the heresy at </p>
<p>Ephesus. However, when commentators come to interpret verse 12, some </p>
<p>(hierarchalists) emphasize the latter part of the verse (authentein), seeing </p>
<p>teaching as one aspect of “authority” (interpreting authentein positively) </p>
<p>and taking silence as somewhat literal. In contrast, others (egalitarians) </p>
<p>tend to emphasize the earlier part of verse 12 (didaskein) and verse 11, </p>
<p>seeing authentein as a misuse of power. Authority, then, becomes an as-</p>
<p>pect of teaching. Was the key problem at Ephesus gender roles and female </p>
<p>relationship to leadership or right knowledge and female relationship </p>
<p>to orthodoxy? Is 1 Timothy mainly about order or salvation? Is the key </p>
<p>problem at Ephesus (and today) role reversal or lack of submission to </p>
<p>truth? My own conclusion is that 1 Timothy is primarily about Paul’s </p>
<p>great themes: right knowledge, salvation, and submission to truth. </p>
<p>Paul explains his earlier sentence with an illustration</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>(2:11–12):</p>
<p>For Adam rst was formed, then Eve, and Adam was not deceived, </p>
<p>e meaning ‘exercise authority’ is most likely. See ESV: “I do not permit a woman to </p>
<p>teach or to exercise authority over a man” (2:12a). In particular, Henry Scott Baldwin </p>
<p>has pointed out that the verb must be separated from the noun in constructing the </p>
<p>denition of the term” (Schreiner 2005: 97, 102).</p>

<p>141. It is a mistake “to approach the study of gar with the theory that it is always or </p>
<p>properly an illative, not to say causal, particle. It is best, in fact, to note the explanatory </p>
