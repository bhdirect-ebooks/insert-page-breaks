<p>Timothy Should Become an Example (4:11—5:2) 111</p>
<p>church (1:13–14), in 4:10, Paul highlights God as judge, encouraging </p>
<p>Timothy to persevere in his desire to please God in his words and actions </p>
<p>because Timothy’s ultimate judge is God, who is living and a savior. Paul </p>
<p>continues to use the imagery of exercise (we labor [kopiaō] and we strive </p>
<p>[agōnizomai]). Kopiaō means to labor but especially “with wearisome </p>
<p>eort.”</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>Paul previously had exhorted the elders at Ephesus to follow his</p>
<p>example and to work hard to supply their own physical needs and those </p>
<p>of needy people.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>Mary is another example of a hard worker (Rom 16:6).</p>
<p>All coworkers should work hard because all ministry (like farming) is </p>
<p>hard work.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>Timothy should work hard, trusting God, because God his</p>
<p>savior is reliable.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>Agōnizomai (strive, 4:10) is even more so a word for athletics sig-</p>
<p>nifying “contend for a prize, esp. in the public games” or “ght.”</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>Greeks</p>
<p>and Romans would exercise in order eventually to contend for a prize </p>
<p>at a public festival.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>Even before the contest, competitors had to arrive</p>
<p>a month early having trained at least ten months before coming. But, </p>
<p>Timothy’s prize was not dependent on a severe mortal judge,</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>but on the</p>
<p>merciful living Savior, who favored his own people.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>Timothy Should Become an Example (4:11—5:2)</p>
<p>Paul now provides an internal summary for Timothy: Continue com-</p>
<p>manding these things and continue teaching (4:11). Parangellō and </p>
<p>didaskō are synonyms.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>Parangellō signies “to transmit a message along</p>
<p>from one to another,”</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>bringing out the sense that what Timothy has</p>
<p>learned from Paul he is to pass on (or transmit) to the church. Parangellō </p>
<p>and its noun parangelia, as well as command,</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>may have the sense of</p>
