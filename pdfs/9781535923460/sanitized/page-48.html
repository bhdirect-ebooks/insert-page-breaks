<p>1 Timothy 132</p>
<p>murderers, immoral persons, male homosexual oenders, slave-deal-</p>
<p>ers, liars, false swearers, and whatever is opposed to healthy teaching </p>
<p>(1:9–10). A lawful use applies the law to those who are not righteous </p>
<p>(1:8–9). Paul uses een illustrations of what is not righteous.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>Lawless</p>
<p>(anomos) can refer in general to Gentiles (1 Cor 9:21), but in this context </p>
<p>clearly applies to those who do evil deeds.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> e focus of the law is nega-</p>
<p>tive, not positive. It tells people what not to do.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>Bebēlos (godless) is an</p>
<p>important word Paul uses to describe the activity occurring at Ephesus </p>
<p>and the myths being told.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>Bebēlos refers to unholy acts that lead to lack</p>
<p>of piety.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> Paul himself was accused of profaning the temple at Jerusa-</p>
<p>lem because he was thought to have entered with a Gentile (Acts 24:6). </p>
<p>Bebēlos summarizes what the Old Testament laws of purity intended to </p>
<p>avoid.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pornos is a general term for a sexually immoral person (1:10). </p>
<p>“Sexual immorality” (porneia) is a broad term referring to any sexual </p>
<p>activities done in a way not pleasing to God. It includes sexual immoral-</p>
<p>ity done outside of monogamous heterosexual marriage (“adultery” or </p>
<p>“incest”) or when not married (“fornication”) or even mental sexual sin </p>
<p>as use of pornography, or even looking at someone with lust.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>Pornos,</p>
<p>like other unholy actions, begins with internal desire, such as lust, that </p>
<p>eventually exhibits itself externally.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> It is oen part of idolatrous celebra-</p>
<p>tions (1 Cor 10:7–8). Along with murder, homosexual actions, lying, </p>
<p>and slander, continued unrepentant behavior will keep believers from </p>
<p>74. See Titus 1:13. He begins with the more general terms in pairs: to the lawless </p>
<p>and disobedient, godless and sinners, unholy and profane, and then, specically, to </p>
<p>patricides and matricides, as well as to murderers, immoral persons, male homo-</p>
<p>sexual oenders, slave-dealers, liars, false swearers, and ends with a general sum-</p>
<p>mary: whatever is opposed to healthy teaching.</p>
<p>75. Luke 22:37; 23:32–33; 2 ess 2:8; 2 Pet 2:8. Paul uses four Greek words that </p>
<p>begin with the a privative: no law, no obedience, no piety, and no holiness. Anupotak-</p>
<p>tos is used in Titus 1:6 and anosios in 2 Tim 3:2 for the heterodox.</p>
<p>76. See also Rom 3:20.</p>
<p>77. Four of its 5 occurrences in the N.T. are in 1, 2 Tim (1 Tim 1:9; 4:7; 6:20; 2 Tim </p>
<p>2:16).</p>
<p>78. 1 Tim 1:9; 2 Tim 2:16. Hebrews describes Esau as bebēlos because he sold his </p>
<p>birthright for one meal (12:16).</p>
<p>79. Aaron and his descendants as priests were to “distinguish between sacred and </p>
<p>profane (bebēlos), and between clean and unclean” (Lev 10:10).</p>
<p>80. Matt 5:27–28; John 8:41; 1 Cor 5:1; 6:15–20; 7:1–2.</p>
<p>81. Matt 15:18–19.</p>
