<p>Heterodox Teaching versus Piety with Contentment (6:3–10) 145</p>
<p>were deluded, their minds were “clouded with smoke” and, therefore, </p>
<p>unclear, consequently they would not know anything.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> In contrast to af-</p>
<p>rming healthy words, some at Ephesus were ailing (noseō). ey were </p>
<p>“sick” or “diseased.”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> In their diseased state,</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>instead of desiring health,</p>
<p>they desired arguments (zētēsis) and word-battles (logomachia). Zētēsis </p>
<p>refers to vigorous arguments that might or might not be over a search for </p>
<p>the truth.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>In 6:4, since the teachers’ minds are clouded with smoke and</p>
<p>thus diseased, the arguments become ends in themselves, not searches </p>
<p>for truth. </p>
<p>Logomachia (word-battles, 6:4) and logomacheō (“to ght about </p>
<p>words,” 2 Tim 2:14) are composite words made of logos (“word”) and </p>
<p>machomai (“ght”) or machē (“battle, combat”).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Paul uses many of the</p>
<p>same words or concepts in 1 Timothy 6:4–5 to describe the heresy in </p>
<p>Crete about worthless battles related to genealogies.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> In the New Testa-</p>
<p>ment, machē and machomai always have negative connotations. Paul de-</p>
<p>scribed the diculties in Macedonia as external battles that caused lack </p>
<p>of rest and aictions (2 Cor 7:5) and James says battles are caused by </p>
<p>sinful desires to want something that cannot be obtained (Jas 4:1). us, </p>
<p>at Ephesus some desired to battle using words (and about words) (6:3–4). </p>
<p>Arguments and word-battles is a pleonasm accentuating by repetition </p>
<p>the main idea that this heterodoxy was promoting ghting, not “righ-</p>
<p>teousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, gentleness” (6:11).</p>
<p>Five harmful behaviors result from the arguments. Phthonos is </p>
<p>“ill-will or malice, esp. envy or jealousy of the good fortune of others.”</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pilate observed that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him “out of </p>
<p>Christ) or objective genitive (words about our Lord Jesus Christ). Probably the lat-</p>
<p>ter ts this context better since it modies healthy words which is parallel to godly </p>
<p>teaching (6:3).</p>
<p>4. See 1 Tim 3:6; 1:7. Recent converts in particular can be deluded (3:6).</p>
<p>5. BDAG, 678; LSJ, 1181. e noun form nosos was used for physical illness. </p>
<p>Jesus’ own commission and that of the Twelve includes healing diseases (Matt 4:23–24; </p>
<p>8:17; 9:35; Mark 1:34; Luke 4:40; 6:18; 7:21; 9:1; 10:1). Even Paul healed the sick at </p>
<p>Ephesus (Acts 19:12). Paul continues Jesus’ commission to the apostles to bring heal-</p>
<p>ing physically and spiritually.</p>
<p>6. See also Wis 17:8.</p>
<p>7. See Titus 3:9.</p>
<p>8. ayer, 380. Literally, machē referred to armies in single combat (LSJ, 1085).</p>
<p>9. Arguments (zētēsis), contentions (eris), battles (machē) (Titus 3:9).</p>
<p>10. LSJ, 1930.</p>
