<p>1 Timothy 2–380</p>
<p>for themselves and much condence in the faith, the one in Christ Jesus” </p>
<p>(3:13).</p>
<p>What are the virtues necessary for this good work? It is neces-</p>
<p>sary the overseer to be not open to attack, a one-woman man, sober, </p>
<p>wise, well behaved, hospitable, apt in teaching, not given to getting </p>
<p>drunk, not pugnacious, but gentle, not contentious, not loving money </p>
<p>(3:2–3).</p>
<p>205</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Such a godly overseer should not be open to attack (anepilēptos) </p>
<p>from outsiders (3:2). Epilambanō can simply refer to holding or grab-</p>
<p>bing onto someone in a neutral or helpful way,</p>
<p>206</p>
<p>but it can also refer to</p>
<p>laying hold of someone in order to arrest or beat someone. In the latter </p>
<p>sense, for example, a crowd in Jerusalem “seized” Paul in order to kill </p>
<p>him (Acts 21:30). Also, some Philippians “seized” Paul and Silas to bring </p>
<p>them before the magistrates (Acts 16:19–20). e Ephesians would well </p>
<p>remember the crowd that “seized” Gaius and Aristarchus, bringing them </p>
<p>to the theater (Acts 19:29).</p>
<p>207</p>
<p> us, in the oen disturbing political Ro-</p>
<p>man context,</p>
<p>208</p>
<p>Paul’s goal was not so much that overseers be “perfect,”</p>
<p>but that the nonbelievers have no legal basis by which to arrest them. </p>
<p>e same will be required of widows (5:7). Anepilē(m)ptos phrased in a </p>
<p>positive way is having “a good testimony from the outsiders” (3:7). Paul </p>
<p>himself, having recently been imprisoned in Rome, would know well that </p>
<p>Christians could not avoid all arrest or beatings, but his goal is to make </p>
<p>sure arrests are not done for criminal behavior by Christian leaders.</p>
<p>209</p>
<p>Can women and single men ever be overseers? First, Paul indicates </p>
<p>that “anyone” should aspire to “overseeing” (3:1), thereby, opening up the </p>
<p>positions to all. Second, how shall we understand language that appears </p>
<p>in the Greek or in translation to be exclusive: “husband of one wife,” “his </p>
<p>own house,” “his children,” “a man,” “he take care,” “he fall,” “he must </p>
<p>have”?</p>
<p>210</p>
<p> Does the gender language limit the position of overseer to mar-</p>
<p>ried men only?</p>
<p>A one-woman man (3:2) is also used in Titus (1:6) and for the </p>
<p>diakonos (“minister,” “one-woman men,” 3:12). A widow in the praying </p>
<p>205. See Titus 1:6–9.</p>
<p>206. E.g., Matt 14:31; Mark 8:23; Luke 9:47; Acts 17:19; 23:19; Heb 8:9.</p>
<p>207. See also Luke 20:20; Acts 18:17; 21:33.</p>
<p>208. See Titus 1:6.</p>
<p>209. Also Peter’s later concern in 1 Pet 2:12–15.</p>
<p>210. 3:2, 4–7 KJV.</p>
