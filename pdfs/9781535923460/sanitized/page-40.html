<p>1 Timothy 124</p>
<p>Paul journeyed on to Macedonia (1 Tim 1:3). Paul asked him to rejoin </p>
<p>him at his nal imprisonment in Rome (2 Tim 4:9). us, Timothy was </p>
<p>with Paul when he wrote eight of his thirteen letters over a period of </p>
<p>about twenty years.</p>
<p>During these travels, Timothy witnessed many marvelous miracles </p>
<p>but also intensive persecutions and suerings. Eventually, he himself was </p>
<p>imprisoned (Heb 13:23). According to tradition, Timothy was martyred </p>
<p>for his faith during the reign of Emperors Domitian (A.D. 81–96) or </p>
<p>Nerva (96–98) at Ephesus by being clubbed to death for protesting the </p>
<p>orgies associated with the cult of Artemis.</p>

<p>Not to Teach Different Doctrine, </p>
<p>but Rather Love (1:3–7)</p>
<p>Aer the introduction (1:1–2), Paul urges Timothy to encourage the </p>
<p>Ephesians not to teach dierent doctrine, but rather love from a clean </p>
<p>heart and a good conscience and genuine faith (1:3–7): As I urged you </p>
<p>to remain longer in Ephesus, while I was going into Macedonia, that </p>
<p>you shall transmit to some not to teach a dierent doctrine and not </p>
<p>to occupy themselves with myths and endless genealogies, which give </p>
<p>rise to speculations rather than stewardship of God’s household, the </p>
<p>one in faith. But the goal of the order is love from a clean heart and a </p>
<p>good conscience and a genuine faith, of which, some having deviated, </p>
<p>they twist out into talk devoid of truth, wanting to be teachers of the </p>
<p>law, not perceiving neither what they say nor concerning what they </p>
<p>assert. is section has three parts: rst, the negative (what not to do </p>
<p>[1:3–4]); second, the positive (what to do [1:5]); and, third, again the </p>
<p>negative (1:6–7).</p>
<p>Paul and Timothy had been in Ephesus in Asia together and then </p>
<p>Paul had le Timothy behind in Ephesus while Paul crossed the Aegean </p>
<p>Sea to Macedonia (1:3).</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Paul had indicated that he planned to visit</p>
<p>Macedonia and Asia Minor when he le his house arrest in Rome.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>He</p>
<p>regularly worked with his coworkers to maximize eectiveness by leaving </p>
<p>some behind or sending some ahead, in a similar way to Jesus, who sent </p>
