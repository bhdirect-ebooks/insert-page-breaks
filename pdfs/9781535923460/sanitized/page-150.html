<p>households,</p>

<p>but Cohick summarizes: “Women did almost every type of</p>
<p>work that was done by men.”</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>Who is the Adversary? Is it Satan or a human? Normally antikeimai, </p>
<p>a verb used as a noun in the plural (“the ones opposing”), refers to human </p>
<p>opponents of Jesus, Paul, and the disciples.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>But, this reference in the</p>
<p>singular may refer to the devil, since Satan is explicitly mentioned in 5:15 </p>
<p>and the earlier reference seems to refer to the devil who condemns be-</p>
<p>lievers (3:6–7). Satan reproaches and then draws people away (5:14–15). </p>
<p>e believer (pistē, 5:16) <span class="_ _4" /><span class="ff1 ws175">has a feminine singular endin<span class="_ _1" />g, as opposed </span></p>
<p>to the plural in 5:4 for the believing children and grandchildren. Is this </p>
<p>a feminine generic? Or, does it refer back to the woman who rules her </p>
<p>household (5:14)</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>as the person responsible for alms (e.g., Prov 31:20)?</p>
<p>One of the qualities needed to enter the widow’s order was for the ma-</p>
<p>ture widow to have helped those being oppressed (5:10 has the same verb </p>
<p>helped, eparkeō). Now, she who helped others is being helped by her own </p>
<p>family. Financially caring for a widow is a “weight” (burden, 5:16) for a </p>
<p>church to sustain. Paul therefore ends (as he began, 5:3) with the positive </p>
<p>comment that it should be done for real widows (5:16).</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Applying the Order of Widows to Today</p>
<p>The care of widows was a concern in ancient societies, but it still is a con-</p>
<p>cern today even in industrialized societies. Women tend to live about seven </p>
<p>years longer than men. In our local community, the planning board has to </p>
<p>make decisions on whether to grant variances for construction. When having </p>
<p>to choose between favoring the building of an apartment for a domestic </p>
<p>employee or an apartment for an elderly mother, the latter is preferred and </p>
<p>more easily granted. The order of widows appears to have developed into the </p>
<p>Roman Catholic and Lutheran order of nuns in cloisters.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>But, what about</p>
<p>us in the Protestant church? Several aspects of the order of widows are </p>
<p>pertinent: (1) should widows or elderly women who dedicate themselves to </p>
