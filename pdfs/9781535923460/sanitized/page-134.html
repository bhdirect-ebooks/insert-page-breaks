<p>1 Timothy 4:1—5:2118</p>
<p>the meditative pondering and the practice of orators and rhetoricians.”</p>
<p>111</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But, it was also used for meditative pondering in the Old Testament, for </p>
<p>example, “in his law will he meditate day and night” (Ps 1:2).</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>Wisdom</p>
<p>“meditates, speaks, and practices” truth, not falsehoods.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>us, meletaō</p>
<p>in 4:15 includes an inward aspect of “meditative pondering” as well as </p>
<p>practice. Paul intensies this inward aspect in the next phrase, which </p>
<p>literally is: “among these things—be” (“exist, live, stay,” 4:15). Paul had </p>
<p>told the Athenians at the Areopagus that God is not far from us because </p>
<p>“in him we are living and we are moving and we are being” (Acts 17:28). </p>
<p>In 1 Timothy, Paul wants Timothy not just to do what Paul asks, but to </p>
<p>be, to have all these previous commands become a part of who he is, </p>
<p>his very being.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>Not that Timothy’s example is perfect, but rather that</p>
<p>he progresses in his spiritual life, becoming a model in word, conduct, </p>
<p>love, faith, purity, reading, encouragement, teaching, use of spiritual </p>
<p>gi (4:12–14). In a similar way, even Jesus as an adolescent progressed </p>
<p>(prokoptō) in wisdom (Luke 2:52) and Paul “advanced” in Judaism (Gal </p>
<p>1:14).</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>What is inward will become outward or visible to all (4:6, 12,</p>
<p>15).</p>
<p>Paul then concludes this section of personal advice to Timothy: </p>
<p>Keep on paying attention to yourself and to the teaching, persevere </p>
<p>in them; for doing this, also you will save yourself and the ones hear-</p>
<p>ing you (4:16). Timothy’s focus should be dual: to himself and to the </p>
<p>content and practice of Christian teaching. He is to persevere in these </p>
<p>commands. e result will be dual: to save himself</p>
<p>116</p>
<p> and to save his lis-</p>
<p>teners (4:16). Salvation is a major theme in this letter. God is the Savior </p>
<p>who desires all to be saved, especially believers including Timothy and </p>
<p>the church at Ephesus.</p>
