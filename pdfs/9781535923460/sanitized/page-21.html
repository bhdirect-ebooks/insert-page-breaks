<p>Introduction to Pastoral Letters 5</p>
<p>matter of fact, we do have ample proof that Paul was indeed released. </p>
<p>Paul writes in Philippians 2:24: “I trust in the Lord that shortly also I </p>
<p>myself will come” aer Timothy. He asks Philemon to “prepare for me </p>
<p>a guest room” (22). e arrest described in Acts, Philippians, Colos-</p>
<p>sians, Ephesians, and Philemon is a mild house arrest, which is usually </p>
<p>a maximum of two years. us, Paul expects release. According to Acts </p>
<p>25:25, Governor Festus states that Paul does not deserve death and King </p>
<p>Agrippa agrees that Paul could have been released (Acts 26:32). While, in </p>
<p>contrast, 2 Timothy describes a more intensive period. Paul explains: “At </p>
<p>my rst defense no one took my part; all deserted me.” “For I am already </p>
<p>on the point of being sacriced, the time of my departure has come.” </p>
<p>“Luke alone is with me.” Demas is gone (Col 4:14) (2 Tim 4:6, 9, 11, 16). </p>
<p>Nero’s early years were known for his mildness and clemency (Eusebius, </p>
<p>Hist. eccl. 2.22), but he changes aer A.D. 64. </p>
<p>e early church also has proof of Paul’s release. Clement, who lived </p>
<p>in the West, wrote that Paul “reached the farthest limits of the West” (1 </p>
<p>Clem. 5:7). He appears to say that Paul went beyond Italy to Spain. Eu-</p>
<p>sebius quotes Origen’s Commentary on Genesis (3:1) that Paul later was </p>
<p>martyred in Rome under Nero: aer defending himself, “the apostle is </p>
<p>said to have set out again on the ministry of preaching and, coming a </p>
<p>second time to the same city, found fulllment in martyrdom. During </p>
<p>this imprisonment he composed the second epistle to Timothy” (Hist. </p>
<p>eccl. 2.22; 3.3). </p>
<p>Scholars have diculty setting a later date for the Pastorals.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>But,</p>
such late dates are not necessary since Gaius and Nero “took their divin-
<p>ity very seriously.” In A.D. 66 Nero was described ocially as “lord and </p>
<p>saviour of the world.” “e cult was already well developed during Paul’s </p>
<p>life.” Especially in Titus, “the author was trying to counter the imperial </p>
<p>cult”: Christ as true Savior versus the false savior Caesar.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>erefore,</p>
<p>Titus and 1 Timothy are more likely written aer Paul’s rst Roman im-</p>
<p>prisonment before Nero began persecuting Christians (c. A.D. 62–64), </p>
<p>11. Some say the Pastorals have “no trace of” persecution such as existed in Igna-</p>
<p>tius’s day (Hanson 1982: 12–13). Ignatius died in A.D. 113, whereas, Emperor Domi-</p>
<p>tian, who persecuted Christians, died in A.D. 96. Some, therefore, conclude that the </p>
<p>Pastorals have to be written before the time of Domitian, but this is too early for other </p>
<p>critics. Another option is one or two years before Ignatius died, but for still others this </p>
<p>is too near Ignatius’s time. Another date for the letters’ composition is aer A.D. 112 </p>
<p>when Trajan revived the imperial cult but before anyone was killed.</p>
