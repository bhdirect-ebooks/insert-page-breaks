<p>Godly Peaceful Lives (2:1–15) 77</p>
<p>by which to persevere in the Christian walk.</p>
<p>185</p>
<p>Some at Ephesus have</p>
<p>renounced or may renounce the faith.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p>In 3:1 Paul will encourage all</p>
<p>to desire to be an overseer or minister. Faith is one key aspect of being </p>
<p>an overseer or minister (3:9, 11, 13). us, faith is a foundation of the </p>
<p>three qualities to follow. Love is an important aspect of sound doctrine.</p>
<p>187</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A negative aspect of the women’s attire while in prayer may have been </p>
<p>aunting wealth or sexual suggestiveness. erefore, Paul adds the quali-</p>
<p>ty of holiness. Hagiasmos or sanctication is God’s will for all believers.</p>
<p>188</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When people are set free from sin, then they (out of gratitude and with </p>
<p>God’s help) set on the road of becoming holy in eect so that they can ob-</p>
<p>tain eternal life (Rom 6:22). Procksch summarizes: in hagiasmos action </p>
<p>is emphasized. It is “the moral form which develops out of [atonement] </p>
<p>and without which there can be no vision of Christ.”</p>
<p>189</p>
<p>In the Pastorals,</p>
<p>a synonym is eusebeia, which is a quality for all believers and a qual-</p>
<p>ity of Christ’s teachings (1 Tim 2:2; 6:3). Hagiasmos (holiness) is modi-</p>
<p>ed by sōphrosynē (wisdom). Sōphrosynē is built on the root sōphrōn, </p>
<p>soundness or wholeness of mind, having control over the sensual desires </p>
<p>(“self-control”).</p>
<p>190</p>
<p> Wisdom helps one become holy. Paul uses this adjec-</p>
<p>tive for self-description before the Roman governor Festus (Acts 26:25). </p>
<p>e opposite is madness (Acts 26:4). Although sōphrosynē was a popular </p>
<p>virtue for Greek women in biblical times,</p>
<p>191</p>
<p>in the New Testament it is</p>
<p>not limited to women. ese four qualities are good for the women to </p>
<p>persist in, but they are not simply for women, but for all Christians. Even </p>
<p>Timothy is exhorted by Paul elsewhere to persist in faith, love, holiness, </p>
<p>and wisdom or self-control.</p>

<p>188. 2 Tim 2:21; Rom 6:19, 22; 1 ess 4:3–4, 7. e verb form (hagiazō) is an im-</p>
<p>portant O.T. concept that goes back as early as Gen 2:3 (God “sanctied” the seventh </p>
<p>day) and as Exod 13:2 (in Passover: “Sanctify to me every rstborn”).</p>
