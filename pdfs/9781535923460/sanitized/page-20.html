<p>Introduction to Pastoral Letters4</p>
<p>4:10. Irenaeus (130–202), who “saw Polycarp in his early youth” (Haer. </p>
<p>3.4), writes that “Paul mentions Linus in his Epistle to Timothy” (Haer. </p>
<p>3.3). He titles this book, “e Refutation &amp; Overthrow of the Knowledge </p>
<p>Falsely So Called.”</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>e Acts of Paul (160) includes people only found</p>
<p>in the Pastorals (Onesiphorus, Hermogenes, and Demas). Origen (185–</p>
<p>253/4) oen refers to Paul as the author of the epistles of Timothy and </p>
<p>Titus, and Tertullian (155–220) quotes all three Pastoral letters (1 Tim </p>
<p>6:20; 2 Tim 1:14; Titus 3:10–11): “I wonder since [Marcion] received a </p>
letter written to an individual, the Epistle to Philemon, that he rejected
<p>two to Timothy and one to Titus written on the subject of church order.”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>However, the Pastoral Letters are not in p46, but, then, neither is </p>
<p>Philemon (and no one questions Paul’s authorship of Philemon). e </p>
scribe compiling p46 excluded all personal letters to individuals. (On the
<p>other hand, the Pastorals could have been included in the missing pages </p>
<p>as the scribe was compressing his letters.)</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Codex Vaticanus (4 c.) omits</p>
<p>the Pastoral Epistles, Philemon, Revelation, and part of Genesis and the </p>
<p>Psalms. e rst person to deny positively the genuineness of 1 Timothy </p>
<p>is F. Schleiermacher in 1807, on the basis of style and language. In 1835, </p>
<p>F. C. Baur questioned all three letters. Current concerns with Paul as the </p>
<p>author of the Pastorals result from historical, literary, ecclesiological, and </p>
<p>theological reasons.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Historical Reasons</p>
<p>e travel plans in the Pastorals do not seem to t with those reported </p>
<p>in Acts. Marxsen concludes: “the Pastorals can have been written by Paul </p>
<p>only if he was set free again aer a rst Roman imprisonment.”</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>As a</p>
<p>6. Irenaeus quotes 1 Tim 1: 4, 9; 2:5; 4:7; 6:20; 2 Tim 4:9–11; Titus 3:10–11, among </p>
<p>other verses (I.16.3; III.14.1;17.1). Other early church fathers who quote the Pastorals </p>
<p>include Justin Martyr (100–148), Dial. 47 (Titus 3:4), Clement of Alexandria (150–</p>
<p>215) (1 Tim 4:1; 6:20; “the second epistle to Timothy,” Titus 1:12), and Athenagoras </p>
<p>(177–180) (quoting 1 Tim 2:2).</p>
<p>7. Eusebius says Paul wrote Titus 3:9 (Hist. eccl. 4.14.7). eophilus, a contempo-</p>
<p>rary of Jerome, cites Titus 2:15 as written by Paul as a basis for acting against those </p>
<p>propagating the heresy of Origen (Letter 87). </p>

<p>9. For more on these issues as well as chronology, epistolary format, style, content, </p>
<p>and theology see Porter 1995: 105–23. As is apparent from my stance in this com-</p>
<p>mentary, I do not nd these arguments convincing.</p>
