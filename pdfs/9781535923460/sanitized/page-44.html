<p>their Christianity has become twisted, not straight, and no longer sound.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What might cause people to miss the goal, a failing against which even </p>
<p>Timothy has to guard? It is mataiologia (talk devoid of truth), because it </p>
<p>results in wrong teaching (1 Tim 1:7). Like idols who have no real value </p>
<p>or power, these words have no value or power. ey are empty.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>Later,</p>
<p>Paul describes them as “profane empty talk and contradictions of the </p>
<p>falsely called knowledge” (6:20). Such teaching was done by the younger </p>
<p>widows who followed Satan and Hymenaeus and Philetus, who taught </p>
<p>that the resurrection is already past (1 Tim 5:15; 2 Tim 2:16–18). </p>
<p>ese want to be teachers of the law (1:7), but understand neither </p>
<p>what they say nor concerning what they assert (1:7). ey have no per-</p>
<p>ception of spiritual truths based on careful faith-based thought.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>Since</p>
<p>such teachers do not understand spiritual matters, they do not even com-</p>
<p>prehend the spiritual implications of their own teachings, which they, </p>
<p>nevertheless, assert with condence (diabebaioomai).</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>Consequently,</p>
<p>their authoritative manner of communication does not ensure the au-</p>
<p>thority or accuracy of that content of the communication. Since both at </p>
<p>Ephesus and Crete, the false teachers disputed about legal questions,</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul calls them teachers of the law, thereby reminding us of a Jewish </p>
<p>connection to their teachings. </p>
<p>Excursus: Women Could Desire to Be Teachers </p>
<p>If these teachers (1:7) included Jewish females (such as younger widows, </p>
<p>5:15), teaching authoritatively would be an unusual and desirable oppor-</p>
<p>49. 1 Tim 1:10; 6:3; Titus 1:9, 13; 2:2. For emphasis, Paul repeats these two verbs at </p>
<p>the end of his letter (6:20–21).</p>
<p>50. See Titus 1:10.</p>
<p>51. Noeō, BDAG, 674; ayer, 426–27. For example, Jesus realizes that his disciples </p>
<p>have observed that when they eat something, it enters the stomach and then leaves </p>
<p>the body. But, they have not carefully thought that this physical truth is analogous to </p>
<p>a spiritual principle (Matt 15:16–20). e rabbinic laws of purity and impurity direct-</p>
<p>ing ways of eating are not what make someone pure (Matt 15:1–20). Faith helps one </p>
<p>understand matters spiritually. See also Heb 11:3; Matt 16:9; 24:15; John 12:40; Rom </p>
<p>1:20; Eph 3:4; 2 Tim 2:7.</p>
<p>52. In Titus 3:8, diabebaioomai is used with positive connotations: Timothy is to </p>
<p>“maintain strongly” the trustworthy teaching that believers should be marked by good </p>
<p>deeds. However, in 1 Tim 1:7, the teachers have untrustworthy teaching.</p>
<p>53. See Titus 1:10; 3:9.</p>
