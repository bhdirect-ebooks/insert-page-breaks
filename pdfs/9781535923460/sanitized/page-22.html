<p>Introduction to Pastoral Letters6</p>
<p>while 2 Timothy was written during Paul’s second Roman imprisonment </p>
<p>(c. A.D. 66–67).</p>
<p>Literary Reasons</p>
<p>Some scholars also see literary problems. ey conclude that the Pas-</p>
<p>torals have a vocabulary distinct from the other letters, however they </p>
<p>do not agree about the number of word dierences. ey notice some </p>
<p>dierent words and style: eusebeia (“godliness”), sōphrosynē (“self-</p>
<p>control”), theosebeia (“religion”), semnos (“character”), hygiēs (“sound”), </p>
<p>dynastēs (“ruler”), makarios (“blessed”), and sōtēr (“savior”). In contrast, </p>
<p>some words important to Paul do not occur: “evangelize,” “give thanks,” </p>
<p>“boast,” “spiritual,” “wisdom” (sophia), “body,” “life” (psychē), “in Christ.” </p>
<p>Dibelius and Conzelmann summarize: “Personal elements fade into the </p>
<p>background, and the letter’s primary purpose is to transmit regulations </p>
<p>... which are not intended” for Timothy, “but for other people.”</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>ey</p>
<p>conclude that the genre is household codes (haustafel). First Timothy is </p>
<p>a collection of materials like the Didache.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> e style is similar to Poly-</p>
<p>carp’s letter to the Philippians, as is its theology and ecclesiology.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>First</p>
<p>Timothy 6:6–10 reproduces popular philosophical maxims on wealth.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, Marxsen concludes in a circular manner that any similarities to </p>
<p>Paul come from the “Pauline tradition.”</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Dibelius and Conzelmann accepted even many years </p>
<p>ago that: “Recent debate has shown that the method of arguing against </p>
<p>authenticity on the basis of statistics is inadequate.”</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> According to lin-</p>
<p>guists who studied the Federalist papers, 100,000 words of undisputed </p>
<p>authorship are needed to compare with disputed writings, but the whole </p>
<p>New Testament has under 140,000 words.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>According to Sakae Kubo’s</p>
<p>Greek-English Lexicon, 1 Timothy has 66 words which occur only once in </p>
<p>the New Testament. In Philippians (another letter to a positive audience), </p>
<p>Paul uses 36 unique words in four chapters. In the rst four chapters of 1 </p>

<p>16. Hanson 1982: 4.</p>
<p>17. Marxsen 1970: 214.</p>
