<p>1 Timothy 6:3–21164</p>
<p>alluding back to 1:5 (“the goal of the order is love from a clean heart </p>
<p>and a good conscience and a genuine faith”), from which the heterodox </p>
<p>teachers had deviated (1:6).</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>In 2 Timothy, Paul will exhort Timothy to</p>
<p>nd others upon whom to rely (2:2). As a good soldier of Christ Jesus (2 </p>
<p>Tim 2:3), Timothy needs to emulate the good tribune Claudius Lysias, </p>
<p>to whom was entrusted the prisoner Paulos of Tarsus. He used a detach-</p>
<p>ment of 200 heavily armed soldiers, 70 cavalrymen, and 200 spearmen to </p>
<p>bring Paul through the night from Jerusalem to Caesarea in order to keep </p>
<p>him alive (Acts 23:23–35). </p>
<p>Timothy needs a strategy that faces two ways: one is proactively </p>
<p>guarding what has been entrusted to him, the other is proactively resist-</p>
<p>ing (turning away from) what could mislead him.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>is false teaching</p>
<p>is summarized as empty talk and contradictions (6:20). Kenophōnia </p>
<p>(empty talk) appears to be a synonym of mataiologia. Mataiologia are </p>
<p>words that have no value because the content is not true.</p>
<p>131</p>
<p> ey are sa-</p>
<p>tanic. Kenophōnia are sounds (phōnē) that are empty (kenos), without </p>
<p>a truthful, real goal,</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>therefore, they deceive (Eph 5:6). ese empty</p>
<p>sounds are unholy, leading to acts that lack piety (godless, bebēlos).</p>
<p>133</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Study of the truth is protection against them (2 Tim 2:15–16).</p>
<p>Talk without value is a synonym for contradictions (antithesis). Ac-</p>
<p>cording to Aristotle, an antithesis is a syllogism in which contraries are </p>
<p>placed side by side, for example, “e wise are unsuccessful, while fools </p>
<p>is only to be revealed to someone trustworthy (Herodotus, Hist. 9.45). For example, </p>
<p>the priests in Jerusalem were entrusted with four hundred talents of silver and two </p>
<p>hundred talents of gold for the relief of widows and orphans (2 Macc 3:10, 15). One </p>
<p>sin in the law was to steal a deposit entrusted to one. is item had to be restored to the </p>
<p>owner (Lev 6:2–4). e comparable verb paratithēmi in the middle voice, signifying </p>
<p>“to deposit; intrust, commit to one’s charge” (ayer, 486) was used by Paul at the start </p>
<p>of the letter (“is order I am entrusting to you, child Timothy,” 1:18).</p>
<p>129. In the closing of 6:20–21, Paul uses a number of words that allude back to </p>
<p>the start of the letter creating a well-rounded message. Some of these words reappear </p>
<p>in 2 Tim: parathēkē vs. paratithēmi (1:18); astocheō (1:6; 2 Tim 2:18); ektrepō (1:6; 2 </p>
<p>Tim 4:4); bebēlos (1:9; 2 Tim 2:16); pistis (1:4; 2 Tim 1:13); kenophōnia vs. ma<span class="_ _1" />taiologia </p>
<p>(1:6); pseudōnymos and pseudologos (4:2). Others think that the deposit is the whole </p>
<p>letter (Fee 1988: 161) or the whole of the apostolic teaching (Marshall 1999: 675–76; </p>
<p>Witherington 2006: 298; Towner 2006: 431).</p>
<p>130. Ektrepō is otherwise used in a negative way of the heterodox turning or twist-</p>
<p>ing away from the true order. See 1:6; 5:15; 2 Tim 4:4.</p>
<p>131. See 1:6; Titus 1:10.</p>
<p>132. 1 Cor 15:4; 2 Cor 6:1; Gal 2:2; Phil 2:16.</p>
<p>133. See 1 Tim 1:9.</p>
