<p>Slaves (6:1–2) 143</p>
<p>Paul describes the slaves as under the yoke (zygos), a negative image </p>
<p>he uses for slavery.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>A yoke was a wooden or iron frame placed over the</p>
<p>necks of two oxen or other cattle and humans when taken captive.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>us,</p>
<p>Paul sympathizes with the slaves with this introductory image. However, </p>
<p>instead of insisting on harming of the master,</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> he wants the slave to re-</p>
<p>gard his/her own master with honor or respect. Paul’s overriding con-</p>
<p>cern is to promote all to be saved and come to knowledge of the truth. If </p>
<p>Christian slaves were disrespectful (timēe) of their masters,</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>God—who</p>
<p>is the Savior of all—and Christian teaching would be slandered.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>Some of the slaves had Christian masters and understandably </p>
<p>might hold a negative opinion</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>of them because they were their equals</p>
<p>in Christ.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>Instead of despising them, the slaves are to serve them (6:2).</p>
<p>Previously, Paul had encouraged slaves to serve their masters as they </p>
<p>would Christ and masters to treat slaves fairly and equally (Eph 6:5–9). </p>
<p>All Christians were to serve each other and honor everyone.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>Jesus and,</p>
<p>later, Paul commanded Christians to resist evil by overcoming evil with </p>
<p>good actions.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>Paul reminds the slaves that as brothers and sisters the</p>
<p>masters are faithful and beloved, themselves devoted to good deeds.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>Paul internally summarizes: ese things—keep on teaching and </p>
<p>encouraging</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>(6:2b), probably referring back to 5:3—6:2, his directions</p>
<p>about dierent categories of people in the church at Ephesus (widows, </p>
<p>elders, and slaves).</p>
<p>126</p>
<p> </p>
<p>115. Gal 5:1; Acts 15:10.</p>
<p>116. IDB 4:924–25.</p>
<p>117. Slaves attacked the masters regularly (Bradley 1994: 112–16).</p>
<p>118. See 1 Tim 5:3. e same root (despotēs) is used for women ruling their house-</p>
<p>holds (oikodespoteō [5:14]).</p>
<p>119. See 1 Tim 3:7; 5:14; Titus 2:5, 10; Rom 2:24; Isa 52:5; Ezek 36:20–21.</p>
<p>120. See 1 Tim 4:12.</p>
<p>121. Phlm 16; Gal 3:28; Col 3:11.</p>
<p>122. Gal 5:13; 1 Pet 2:17.</p>
<p>123. Matt 5:39–41; Rom 12:18–21.</p>
<p>124. Since the last phrase is an appositive to the masters, I think that the masters, </p>
<p>together with the slaves, are doing good deeds, i.e., furthering the faith. Others think </p>
<p>the slaves do the good deeds (Kelly 1963: 132; Marshall 1999: 632–33; Towner 2006: </p>
<p>385–88).</p>
<p>125. See 1 Tim 2:12; Titus 2:15.</p>
<p>126. Towner (2006: 379) begins the section at 5:1.</p>
