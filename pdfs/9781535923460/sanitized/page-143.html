<p>True Widows and Younger Widows (5:3–16) 127</p>
<p>Like the overseer and minister/deacon, the real widow was to be </p>
<p>a one-man woman (5:9).</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>She, too, would have had to be faithful and</p>
<p>devoted and focused only on her husband (not another man), when he </p>
<p>had been alive. An ancient married man in his culture, unlike a married </p>
<p>woman, was not considered an “adulterer” if he had sexual relations with </p>
<p>a slave, concubine, or a prostitute. However, married women could be </p>
<p>enticed into a lifestyle promulgated by some of the wealthy Roman soci-</p>
<p>ety of the era of Emperor Augustus (aer 44 B.C.) and later. Promiscuity </p>
<p>was promoted by some poets and playwrights.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Ovid, for example, writes</p>
<p>that a husband “is too countried” who is hurt by an adulterous wife. </p>
<p>Rome, he wrote, was founded on the adulterous practices of Mars, but </p>
<p>Romulus and Remus were born without reproach. e husband should </p>
<p>“cherish the friends your wife will bring.”</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> Winter concludes that in Ro-</p>
<p>man society “there was a pattern of sexual mores of women that openly </p>
<p>deed the legislation on adultery and attendant issues.”</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>Some in the</p>
<p>later church questioned whether women should remarry at all aer the </p>
<p>husband’s death.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>In contrast, Paul assumes a wife can marry another</p>
<p>man should her husband die (Rom 7:3; 1 Cor 7:39).</p>
<p>Although the Jews and Romans emphasized for women marriage </p>
<p>and childrearing,</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> the ancients also had strong inuences for being celi-</p>
<p>bate or at least single. About ten years before 1 Timothy, Paul had encour-</p>
<p>aged widows and those who had never married to remain single, as he </p>
<p>was. However, he explains, to marry is not sin (1 Cor 7:7–8, 28, 36, 40). </p>
<p>Prayer warriors would certainly be needed during the forthcoming per-</p>
<p>secutions by Nero (A.D. 64–68) and the war in Jerusalem (A.D. 66–74). </p>
<p>However, Paul summarized that remaining single is for the person who </p>
<p>epitaph for “Maria the deacon” which cites 1 Tim 5:10.</p>
<p>25. See 1 Tim 3:2, 12.</p>

<p>29. Montanists thought those who married a second time should be kept from </p>
<p>communion of the church (Jerome 2010: 292). Tertullian decided that second mar-</p>
<p>riages were a type of fornication (Exh. cast. ch. 9; Const. ap. 3.2). Jerome, however, </p>
<p>called his Mon. “a heretical book about monogamy, which no one who reads the </p>
<p>apostle will fail to know is contrary to the apostle” (Jerome 2010: 293). Tertullian </p>
<p>wrote “We admit one marriage, just as we do one God,” while the “heretics do away </p>
<p>with marriages” (Mon. ch. 1). Even some Romans thought widows should not remarry </p>
<p>(Pomeroy 1975: 161; Tertullian, Exh. cast. ch. 13).</p>
