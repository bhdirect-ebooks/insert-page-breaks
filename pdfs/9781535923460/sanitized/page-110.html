<p>1 Timothy 2–394</p>
<p>used already to describe what ministers do (3:10). e verb is not limited </p>
<p>to those with the gi of serving physical needs (Acts 6:2; 2 Cor 8:19–20), </p>
<p>as it also describes Timothy and Erastus’ work with Paul (Acts 19:22). </p>
<p>Peter uses it for both gis in general and specically for those who serve </p>
<p>physical needs (1 Pet 4:10–11). e advantage of serving well in leader-</p>
<p>ship helps the ministers in their Christian walk. It advances their faith </p>
<p>(acquire a good foothold) and increases their condence in the faith </p>
<p>(3:13). A foothold (bathmos) is “a structured rest for the foot marking </p>
<p>a stage in ascending or descending, step.”</p>
<p>277</p>
<p> Jesus son of Sirach encour-</p>
<p>ages: “If you discover anyone who is wise, rise early to visit him; let your </p>
<p>feet wear out his doorstep” (Sir 6:36 REB). e “steps of his gate” (LXX) </p>
<p>are symbolic of the way toward one’s own wisdom. erefore, does Paul </p>
<p>refer to service as a way to progress in one’s own faith or, instead, service </p>
<p>as a means toward a “higher” ecclesiastical position, such as overseer? </p>
<p>e text is unclear,</p>
<p>278</p>
<p>but my own preference is the former because the</p>
<p>pronoun and the voice (middle) clarify the step is for themselves, in the </p>
<p>present (not the future) tense, the standing is good, not “better,”</p>
<p>279</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>the sentence ends with highlighting it is the faith in Christ Jesus toward </p>
<p>which one is focused.</p>
<p>Paul concludes this section of his letter where he focuses on how </p>
<p>godly overseeing helps the church advance the truth (3:1–16): I am writ-</p>
<p>ing to you these things, while hoping to come to you shortly; but if I </p>
<p>may delay, that you may know how it is necessary to behave in God’s </p>
<p>house, which is the church of the living God, pillar and support of the </p>
<p>truth (3:14–15).</p>
<p>Paul could have brought his teaching on these qualities for overseers </p>
<p>and ministers in person rather than send them by letter since he planned </p>
<p>to come soon to Ephesus from Macedonia (1:3). However, in case of </p>
<p>delay, he wanted Timothy to understand mentally what kind of behav-</p>
<p>ior is needed in those who lead God’s house (3:14–15). A house (oikos) </p>

<p>278. Commentators dier in their understanding of this phrase, e.g., “e eccle-</p>
<p>siastical writers” “take it to be a higher grade or rank, but it is doubtful if Paul means </p>
<p>that here” (Robertson 1931: 575); his “whole purpose is to enhance the value of the </p>
<p>oce” (citing Wareld, Mounce 2000: 206); “ey who have discharged this ministry </p>
<p>in a proper manner are worthy of no small honour” (Calvin: 2186); Standing probably </p>
<p>refers to “their inuence and reputation in the believing community, although it could </p>
<p>refer to their standing with God” (Fee 1988: 89); it refers to an “excellent standing” in </p>
<p>the church (Towner 2006: 268); TLNT 1:250–51.</p>
<p>279. Mounce 2000: 206.</p>
