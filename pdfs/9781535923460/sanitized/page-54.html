<p>Passage Teaching Alternate</p>
<p>1 Tim </p>
<p>1:15</p>
<p>“that Christ Jesus came into the world to save </p>
<p>sinners”</p>
<p>1 Tim 3:1 “if anyone aspires to overseeing, (s)he desires a </p>
<p>good work”</p>
<p>2:15</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>1 Tim </p>
<p>4:9–10</p>
<p>“for this we work and strive, since we hope on </p>
<p>the living God, who is Savior of all humans, </p>
<p>especially believing ones”</p>
<p>4:8</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>2 Tim </p>
<p>2:11–13</p>
<p>“for if we died together, also we will live to-</p>
<p>gether, if we persevere, also we will reign, if we </p>
<p>will deny, he also will deny us, if we become </p>
<p>unfaithful, that one remains faithful, for he is </p>
<p>not able to renounce himself.”</p>
<p>2:8–10</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>Titus 3:8 “that those who have trusted in God may be </p>
<p>careful to devote themselves to doing what is </p>
<p>good”</p>
<p>3:4–7</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>However, on account of this I received mercy, that in me rst </p>
<p>Christ Jesus might reveal all compassion for an example for the ones </p>
<p>about to believe in him for eternal life (1:16). Because Christ Jesus </p>
<p>came into the world to save sinners, Paul received mercy. Example </p>
<p>(hypotypōsis) might better be translated a “prototype.” Hypotypōsis</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> oc-</p>
<p>curs twice in the Pastoral Letters. In 2 Timothy, hypotypōsis refers to the </p>
<p>“healthy words” which Timothy heard from Paul (1:13). In 1 Timothy, an </p>
<p>aspect of that teaching is exemplied by Jesus’ actions toward Paul. Paul </p>
<p>115. Most scholars think 3:1 is the saying; cf. Dibelius and Conzelmann 1972: </p>
<p>28–29.</p>
<p>116. Mounce 2000: 48; Humphreys 1895: 249 agree 4:9–10<span class="ws1c2"> is the sayin<span class="_ _1" />g; others </span></p>
<p>think 4:8 is the saying (Fee 1988: 105; Lock 1924: 51; Robertson 1931: 618 Ellicott </p>
<p>1865: 75–76).</p>
<p>117. Mounce 2000: 49; Fee 1988: 249; Bernard 1922: 120 agree 2:11–13 is the say-</p>
<p>ing; others think 2:8–10 is the saying (Lock 1924: 96; Humphreys 1895: 249; Ellicott </p>
<p>1865: 139).</p>
<p>118. Humphreys 1895: 249 agrees Titus 3:8 is the saying; others think 3:4–7 or </p>
<p>3:5–8a is the saying (Towner 2006: 789; Mounce 2000: 49; Fee 1988: 207; Robertson </p>
<p>1931: 607; Bernard 1922: 120; Ellicott 1865: 215).</p>
<p>119. e preposition hypo appears to intensify the noun typos (Robertson 1934: </p>
<p>634).</p>
