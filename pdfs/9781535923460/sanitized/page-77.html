<p>Godly Peaceful Lives (2:1–15) 61</p>
<p>and didaktikos are especially frequent (71%, 100%). e frequency of this </p>
<p>word family is understandable in light of the diculties with heterodoxy </p>
<p>at Ephesus at this time. Paul’s goal is “healthy” teaching,</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>as opposed</p>
<p>to heterodox,</p>
<p>102</p>
<p> demonic teaching (1 Tim 4:1) or teaching for shame-</p>
<p>ful gain (Titus 1:11).</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>Teaching should be an important emphasis for</p>
<p>Timothy,</p>
<p>104</p>
<p> Titus (Titus 2:1, 7), Paul,</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> the elders (male and female),</p>
<p>106</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and other faithful people (2 Tim 2:2). For Paul, teaching is one of the </p>
spiritual gis given to individuals for the edication of others, especially
<p>to equip other Christians for ministry and to help them mature.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In light of the heterodox teaching and learning at Ephesus,</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>Paul</p>
<p>highlights the women in particular as needing to learn but not yet teach, </p>
<p>most likely because of their unpreparedness in withstanding heterodoxy, </p>
<p>a heterodoxy that may have been especially appealing to the women at </p>
<p>Ephesus.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>Paul focuses on teaching because the teacher especially is one</p>
<p>who must be qualied to teach the truth and Paul wanted to make sure </p>
<p>they understood God’s teachings.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>However, all women everywhere</p>
<p>were not dissuaded from teaching. Prisca, along with her husband Aquila </p>
<p>(admired coworkers of Paul), certainly taught Apollos with great accu-</p>
<p>racy (Acts 18:25–26) and the female elders at Crete were to teach (Titus </p>
<p>2:3). In addition, women had a long history as religious leaders: prophets, </p>
<p>wise women, apostles, church overseers, and ministers.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>Paul in 2:12 does not use the imperative (as he does in 2:11 [let </p>
<p>learn]). Rather, he uses the rst person singular present indicative (I am </p>
<p>not permitting). e present tense basically denotes linear action. Its </p>
<p>most frequent use is descriptive.</p>

<p>When Paul uses the present active</p>

<p>106. 1 Tim 3:1–2; 5:17; Titus 1:6–9; 2:3.</p>
<p>107. Rom 12:7; 1 Cor 12:28–29; 14:6; Eph 4:11; Col 1:28. </p>

<p>112. Robertson 1934: 879. In other words, Greek has aspect and time. e gram-</p>
<p>marian Caragounis (2004: 318–20) demonstrates knowledge of both time and aspect </p>
<p>in numerous ancient and modern grammarians. Payne (2009: 320–25) also explains </p>
<p>why the rst person singular present active indicative indicates Paul’s own personal </p>
