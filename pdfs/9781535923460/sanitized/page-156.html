<p>sicknesses (5:23). Apparently Timothy was drinking only water and not </p>
<p>drinking any wine even though “water was relatively scarce and oen </p>
<p>polluted.”</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>One ancient writer said: “it is hurtful to drink wine or water</p>
<p>alone” while “wine mingled with water is pleasant” (2 Macc 15:39). Wine </p>
<p>was a regular part of ancient life, used not only with meals, but also as </p>
<p>part of some temple sacrices,</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>and for disinfection (Luke 10:34). Jesus</p>
<p>used wine as a positive image</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>and even turned water into ne wine</p>
<p>as his rst sign in Cana of Galilee (John 2:3–11; 4:46). Wine in itself is </p>
<p>not considered evil in the Bible. God brings forth “wine to gladden the </p>
<p>human heart, oil to make the face shine, and bread to strengthen the </p>
<p>human heart” (Ps 104:15 NRSV). Solomon states: “wine gladdens life” </p>
<p>(Eccl 10:19). Nevertheless, drunkenness was clearly discouraged because </p>
<p>it led to wild living and not being lled by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>Titus and</p>
<p>Timothy are warned not to choose leaders that drink too much wine.</p>

<p>e playwright Eubulus has Dionysus explain: </p>
<p>ree bowls only do I mix for the temperate—one to health </p>
<p>which they empty rst, the second to love and pleasure, the </p>
<p>third to sleep. When this is drunk up wise guests go home. e </p>
<p>fourth is ours no longer, but belongs to violence; the h to up-</p>
<p>roar, and sixth to drunken revel, the seventh to black eyes. e </p>
<p>eighth is the policeman’s, the ninth belongs to vomiting, and the </p>
<p>tenth to madness and hurling the furniture.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>A little wine would denitely t under the rst bowl, possibly a second </p>
<p>bowl might “gladden the heart,” but aer that clearly more bowls were </p>
<p>excessive.</p>
<p>Why might Timothy have been drinking only water? Possibly, he </p>
<p>had made a Nazirite vow to abstain as a means to dedicate himself as </p>
<p>pure (hagneia) to the Lord.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>is vow could be made for a specied</p>
<p>time period. However, he was hesitant to stop this vow early (cf. 5:12) </p>
<p>even despite physical complications from the impure water.</p>
