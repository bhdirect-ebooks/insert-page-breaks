<p>1 Timothy 122</p>
<p>having given himself as a ransom (2:5–6)</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>and the Lord who will return</p>
<p>victorious (6:14–15).</p>
<p>Almost every New Testament letter uses the dual salutation “grace </p>
<p>and peace,” including 1 and 2 Timothy.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Grace would be similar to the</p>
<p>common Hellenistic greeting (chairein).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> Peace (eirenē) would be a com-</p>
<p>mon Hebrew greeting.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>us, grace and peace is a synecdoche reminding</p>
<p>the reader of the new (Greek) and the old (Hebrew) covenants and the </p>
<p>mission to both Gentiles and Jews. But, only 1, 2 Timothy, 2 John, and </p>
<p>Jude add the noun mercy (eleos) in the salutation.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Salvation, hope, and</p>
<p>mercy are closely related (1 Tim 1:13–16). Because Christ came to save </p>
<p>sinners by being merciful, he gives hope.</p>
<p>Timothy is the recipient of the letter, a genuine child in faith (1:2). </p>
<p>Genuine (gnēsios, gnēsiōs) occurs only a few times in the New Testament </p>
<p>(5). Genuine child is used also of Titus.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Timothy, like Titus, has a Gentile</p>
<p>father, but, unlike Titus, a Jewish mother. us, genuine or “legitimate” </p>
<p>probably has several allusions. (1) Timothy has a faith which is genuine, </p>
<p>unlike the heterodox teachers at Ephesus. (2) Timothy, although of mixed </p>
<p>ethnic parentage, should consider himself genuinely pure. His mother, </p>
<p>Eunice, and grandmother, Lois, trained Timothy in the Old Testament </p>
<p>from his youth (2 Tim 1:5; 3:15). As an adult, he was circumcised (Acts </p>
<p>16:3). (3) Timothy was a genuine child of Paul. Even though Timothy’s </p>
<p>father may not have been a believer,</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Timothy had a spiritual father in</p>
<p>Paul. Paul, who had no literal children, had a spiritual child in Timothy. </p>
<p>In addition, they served together as father and son in the same “busi-</p>
<p>ness”—ministry (Phil 2:22). (4) Moreover, as Paul’s child in (the) faith, </p>
<p>Timothy exemplied fully Paul’s teachings in word and deed.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>(5) He</p>
<p>was also genuinely concerned for others (Phil 2:20).</p>
