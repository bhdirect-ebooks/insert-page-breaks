<p>Godly Peaceful Lives (2:1–15) 71</p>
<p>and I ate” (Gen 3:14). Adam, in contrast, does not claim he is deceived. </p>
<p>Rather, he blames God for having given him Eve and blames Eve for hav-</p>
<p>ing given him the forbidden fruit (Gen 3:13). e dialogue between the </p>
<p>“cray” serpent and Eve shows elements of the process of deception and </p>
<p>its lies. First, the serpent raised a challenge in the form of a question, why </p>
<p>did God make a certain command? He also rephrased the command to </p>
<p>make it impossible to obey: “Why has God said, Do not eat from any </p>
<p>tree in the garden?” (Gen 3:2). Eve and Adam would starve if they could </p>
<p>not eat of any tree! en, the serpent made several promises that were </p>
<p>completely false: (1) “You shall not surely die” and (2) they would be as </p>
<p>gods knowing good and evil (3:5–6). ey did die (5:5). ey learned </p>
<p>only evil, not good, and became less like God. Eve, too, in her dialogue </p>
<p>with the serpent made God’s commandment more dicult than it was </p>
<p>(they were not to “touch” the tree, 3:4). en, she catalogued the positive </p>
<p>values of the forbidden fruit (nutritious, aesthetic, and educational [3:7]), </p>
<p>values she could have gotten elsewhere. Deception here was an interac-</p>
<p>tive process of informational distortions between the serpent and Eve </p>
<p>enticing Eve away from what was good and true.</p>
<p>160</p>
<p>Lies as these are not told in order to protect someone or to do some-</p>
<p>thing good. Rather, they may be done for reasons of self-aggrandizement </p>
<p>(power) or sexual oppression.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p>Possibly false teachers might also want</p>
<p>power over others. e Bible highlights false teaching as a major way </p>
<p>to deceive.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p>Unsuspecting people can be deceived (Rom 16:18). In 1</p>
<p>Timothy 2:13–14 and 2 Corinthians 11:3, Eve is used as a prototype for </p>
<p>persons who are deceived by Satan by teachings that lead them away </p>
<p>from the truth. In 2 Corinthians, Eve illustrates the danger to the whole </p>
<p>church of Corinth, while in 1 Timothy she illustrates the danger for the </p>
<p>women at the church in Ephesus. However, deception is not limited to </p>
<p>women. Paul himself says he was deceived by sin (Rom 7:11). Neverthe-</p>
<p>less, Eve has become for Paul a prototype of someone who sins because </p>
<p>of deception. Adam certainly sinned. In contrast to Eve, he is a prototype </p>
<p>of someone who sins, but not by means of deception.</p>
<p>163</p>
<p>He knew what</p>
<p>160. See Spencer 1985: 30–34. Eve was not deceived in taking the initiative over </p>
<p>the man, but in questioning God’s word (Payne 2009: 409; Belleville 2005: 222).</p>
<p>161. Exod 8:29; 22:16; Judg 14:15; 16:5; 2 Sam 3:25.</p>
<p>162. E.g., Gen 3:2–14; Rom 16:18; 2 Cor 11:3–6; Eph 5:5–6; Col 2:8; 2 ess 2:3, </p>
<p>10; Jas 1:26. </p>
<p>163. Chrysostom (Hom. Gen. 17. 18–19) also notes that Adam was not ignorant </p>
<p>or deceived.</p>
