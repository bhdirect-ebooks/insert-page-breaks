<p>Introduction to Pastoral Letters</p>
<p>When Luke the evangelist wrote his Gospel, he highlighted for eophi-</p>
<p>lus, his reader, some of the features he oered, while arming the Gos-</p>
<p>pels already written (Luke 1:1–4). Following the model of this wonderful </p>
<p>historian, I, too, would like to arm the many wonderful commentaries </p>
<p>written on the Pastoral Epistles, which are Pastor Paul’s instructions and </p>
<p>admonitions to two young pastors. As many of the other commentary </p>
<p>writers of the New Covenant Commentary Series, I come from an in-</p>
<p>ternational background, born and reared in Santo Domingo, Domini-</p>
<p>can Republic, and later in New Jersey in the United States, my mother </p>
<p>from Puerto Rico and my father from e Netherlands. Like others in </p>
<p>the series, I have focused on the ow of argument. My own translation </p>
<p>is an attempt to illustrate the literal text as a basis for interpretation and </p>
<p>stylistic analysis. I have studied the meaning of the text in light of its </p>
<p>immediate and larger literary, biblical, historical, social, and cultural </p>
<p>contexts. In particular, I have asked myself, how might these ancient </p>
<p>communities have understood and received these teachings? To enrich </p>
<p>my study, I traveled to Crete, Ephesus, Rome, and Greece, visiting many </p>
<p>key ancient Greco-Roman sites. ese were wonderful trips which were </p>
<p>accomplished with the help and companionship of my husband, the Rev. </p>
<p>Dr. William David Spencer, and son, Mr. Stephen William Spencer.</p>
<p>In addition, I have always thought that scholarship would be ad-</p>
<p>vanced if more women were to study and publish on these letters that </p>
<p>relate frequently to women and to church life. us, as a female Pres-</p>
<p>byterian minister ordained for forty years (October 1973), I have paid </p>
<p>consistent attention to any issues that relate to women and their role in </p>
<p>the church. It is not, however, a commentary solely focused on “women’s </p>
<p>issues.” As an active minister, who has taught New Testament theology </p>
<p>for ministry for many years, I have also highlighted Paul’s ministry strate-</p>
<p>gies, his coworkers, and their community. My own initial training was </p>
<p>in stylistics, and, thus, when appropriate, I have also highlighted Paul’s </p>
<p>rhetorical strategies.</p>
