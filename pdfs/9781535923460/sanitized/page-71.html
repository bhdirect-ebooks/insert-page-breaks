<p>Godly Peaceful Lives (2:1–15) 55</p>
<p>e women likewise had problems during prayer: Likewise (I want </p>
<p>the) women (to pray) in well behaved deportment with respect for oth-</p>
<p>ers and wisely to adorn themselves, not in gold-braided hair or pearls </p>
<p>or expensive apparel, but (to adorn themselves) with what is proper </p>
<p>for women professing religion, through good actions (2:9–10). Since </p>
<p>the false teaching at Ephesus emphasized the external literal keeping of </p>
<p>laws</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>as opposed to fullling genuine virtues in action, this diculty</p>
<p>manifested itself among the women in attention to their external apparel, </p>
<p>rather than to the Christian virtues. In a city concerned for wealth,</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>Christian women too were concerned to aunt their wealth, possibly in a </p>
<p>sexually suggestive manner. us, Paul is not against gold and pearls per </p>
<p>se, but the obsession with and aunting of wealth. Rather, the wealthy are </p>
<p>to use their resources “to do good, to be rich in good works, to be gener-</p>
<p>ous, ready to share” (6:18).</p>
<p>Paul uses two synonyms for clothing (2:9). Neither is the common </p>
<p>word for “a piece of clothing.”</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>Katastolē (deportment) can refer to</p>
<p>“outward attire, either the character one exhibits in personal deportment </p>
<p>or someth. to cover the body.”</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>A stolē was “a loose outer garment for</p>
<p>men which extended to the feet” worn by kings, priests, and persons of </p>
<p>rank.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>Himatismos (apparel, 2:9) is used by Paul to describe clothing that </p>
<p>could be coveted (Acts 20:33) and in the Gospels to describe the nicely </p>
<p>dressed former demoniac.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> In 1 Timothy, apparel is modied by the ad-</p>
<p>jective “very expensive” (polytelēs) (2:9).</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>us, katastolē and himatismos</p>
<p>combined with polytelēs identies “very expensive clothing” that implies </p>
<p>the women’s perspective needs reorientation.</p>
<p>Paul, instead, describes the right type of external appearance as ex-</p>
<p>emplary character, which is demonstrated by good actions, not attire.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Katastolē is modied by three words: kosmios (well behaved), aidōs (re-</p>
<p>spect for others), and sōphrosynē (wisely) (2:9). is same word family </p>
