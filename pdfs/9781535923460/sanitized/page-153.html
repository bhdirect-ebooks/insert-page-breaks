<p>Elders Leading Well (5:17–25) 137</p>
<p>the worker of his wages, taught by Jesus to the Twelve (Matt 10:10) and </p>
<p>the Seventy-two disciples (Luke 10:7), but here Paul cites Luke word for </p>
<p>word. Paul thereby treats the Gospel of Luke as Scripture, with the same </p>
<p>authority as the Old Testament.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>In the context of the gospel, wages for a</p>
<p>worker includes room and board (Luke 10:7). In 1 Corinthians 9, wages </p>
<p>is analogous to the salary of a soldier, the harvest of a farmer, and the </p>
<p>sustenance for a priestly family (vv. 7, 10, 13). Workers for God’s king-</p>
<p>dom should not have to work at another occupation (v. 14).</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>Ministry is</p>
<p>work. Worthiness merits a reward of wages. Elders are worthy because </p>
<p>they work.</p>
<p>Paul continues with the topic of elders, but now about how to treat </p>
<p>judicial cases (or elders who may have not led well): Against an elder—</p>
<p>do not accept a charge, except upon two or three witnesses. e ones </p>
<p>continuing to sin—rebuke before all, in order that also the rest may </p>
<p>keep on having fear. I charge before God and Christ Jesus and the </p>
<p>elect angels, that you might keep these things without discrimination, </p>
<p>doing nothing by partiality (5:19–21). A charge is a formal, serious </p>
<p>“accusation.”</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>When Jesus was brought before Governor Pontius Pilate,</p>
<p>he was charged by the chief priests and elders (Matt 27:11–13). Also, Paul </p>
<p>was “accused” by the high priests and elders before governors Felix and </p>
<p>Festus.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>e charge could lead to death (Acts 25:11). Even Festus abided</p>
<p>by the “Roman custom” to allow the accused (katēgoreō) (especially if a </p>
<p>Roman citizen) to defend him/herself “face to face” against the accuser’s </p>
<p>charge (katēgoros, Acts 25:16). Paul warns Timothy not to “welcome” (ac-</p>
<p>cept, Acts 15:4) such an accusation except if more than one person makes </p>
<p>it. Paul follows Jesus’ teachings which were built on Old Testament law </p>
<p>(Deut 19:15).</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>If another Christian does not listen when (s)he is shown</p>
<p>83. If 1 Tim is written between A.D. 62–64, then the Gospel of Luke must have </p>
<p>been written earlier. Marshall (1999: 616) agrees that “a written source is surely re-</p>
<p>quired, and one that would have been authoritative.”</p>
<p>84. Paul encouraged the Philippians to contribute nancially to his own ministry </p>
<p>(Phil 4:10–19; 2 Cor 11:9). In 1 Tim 4:10, Paul and Timothy describe their ministry as </p>
<p>“work.” Const. ap. 2.28 commands that a double portion of rst-fruits be given by the </p>
<p>laity to the elders who teach. Gis should also be given to the pastors, elder women, </p>
<p>deacons, readers, singers, and porters. e idea of “double honor’ could be built from </p>
<p>Deut 21:17, the rst-born receiving double.</p>
<p>85. See Titus 1:6; LSJ, 927.</p>
<p>86. Acts 23:26–30; 25:5.</p>
<p>87. Also Deut. 17:6; 2 Cor 13:1. e rabbis also used this O.T. law, e.g., m. Sotah </p>
<p>6:3.</p>
