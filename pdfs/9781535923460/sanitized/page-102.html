<p>1 Timothy 2–386</p>
<p>eat breakfast” with him (John 21:12). Believers are to be hospitable even </p>
<p>to enemies (Rom 12:20–21).</p>
<p>231</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Apt or skillful at teaching (3:2) is a key characteristic for an over-</p>
<p>seer at a time when the church is confused about which teaching is sound </p>
<p>and unsound.</p>

<p> e women at Ephesus need to learn.</p>
<p>233</p>
<p>e women at</p>
<p>Crete need to teach.</p>
<p>234</p>
<p> Believers need to be taught so they can teach oth-</p>
<p>ers (2 Tim 2:2). Teaching is so important that elders who teach should </p>
<p>be paid more than others (1 Tim 5:17–18). Eective teaching is oen </p>
<p>combined with wisdom.</p>
<p>235</p>
<p>ese rst seven qualities in the list are all positive (3:2). e next </p>
<p>two are negative (3:3). Not given to getting drunk is an antithesis of </p>
<p>sober. Not pugnacious is an antithesis of gentle and not contentious.</p>
<p>236</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e men at Ephesus already were quarreling in the midst of prayer (2:8). </p>
<p>e heterodox were also disputing about words (6:4). e overseer, who </p>
<p>has been forgiven and ransomed by the Messiah, must have a dierent </p>
<p>style. To be pugnacious is to be “ready with a blow,” whether physical or </p>
<p>verbal.</p>
<p>237</p>
<p>Sometimes pugnaciousness is considered an asset for a man,</p>
<p>but a decit for a woman. Here it is not an asset for either. Instead, the </p>
<p>overseer, like every other Christian, should aim to be gentle and reason-</p>
<p>able.</p>
<p>238</p>
<p> Gentleness is one of the qualities of a wise teacher (Jas 3:17). Je-</p>
<p>sus, too, is gentle and reasonable (2 Cor 10:1). Some Corinthians saw this </p>
<p>trait as a sign of weakness, not strength (2 Cor 10:1). e synonym, not </p>
<p>contentious (amachos) or “peaceable,” can refer to those who are “un-</p>
<p>conquerable” because they take no part in battles.</p>
<p>239</p>
<p>Instead they should</p>
<p>“love from a clean heart and a good conscience and a genuine faith” (1 </p>
<p>Tim 1:5).</p>
<p>In 3:4–7, Paul moves from adjectives to more elaborate descriptions: </p>
<p>managing his/her own house well, having children in submission, with </p>
<p>231. Some believers renowned for their hospitality include Abraham and Sarah, </p>
<p>the poor widow of Zarephath, the wealthy Shunammite, Elisha, Job, Zacchaeus, and </p>
<p>Lydia (Gen 18:1–8; 1 Kgs 17:10–16; 2 Kgs 4:8–16; 6:22–23; Job 31:32; Luke 19:1–10; </p>
