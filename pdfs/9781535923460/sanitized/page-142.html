<p>(5:7). Not only is it a godly act and an act of thanksgiving (5:4), but it </p>
<p>is also one which will lessen attacks from outsiders (5:7).</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> Even non-</p>
<p>Christian Greeks thought children should take care of their parents. For </p>
<p>instance, Plato thought that citizens customarily treat parents “in awe </p>
<p>and care and obedience” if they look for the favor of gods and humans </p>
<p>(Resp. 5. 463D). Denying the faith is not only verbal, but it refers as well </p>
<p>to action.</p>

<p>Widows, as a group of people who may be easily oppressed,</p>
<p>are of special concern to God and serve as an apt synecdoche for the </p>
<p>Christian faith. James, too, summarizes pure religion as “to look aer </p>
<p>orphans and widows in their distress, to keep oneself unstained from the </p>
<p>world” (Jas 1:27).</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Paul now continues with positive specic attributes for a real wid-</p>
<p>ow: Let a widow be enrolled having become no less than sixty years, </p>
<p>a one-man woman, bearing witness by good works: if she brought </p>
<p>up children, if she showed hospitality, if she washed the feet of holy </p>
<p>ones, if she helped those being oppressed, if she followed aer every </p>
<p>good work (5:9–10). At sixty, a woman would be well past the age for </p>
<p>bearing children,</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>an “elder” according to the Mishnah (m. ‘Abot 5:21)</p>
<p>and for the Greeks and Romans in the nal stage of life (gerōn).</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>later church oen fused the positions of widow (5:3) and deacon (3:11), </p>
<p>requiring celibacy for both.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>e ecumenical and generally recognized</p>
<p>as authoritative Council of Chalcedon (A.D. 451) assumed a female “dea-</p>
<p>coness” not marry, but allowed her to be ordained at forty years of age </p>
<p>(Canon 15). e Council in Trullo (A.D. 692) explained the reason for </p>
<p>the lowering of the age was because the Council of Chalcedon “saw that </p>
the Church by divine grace had gone forth more powerful and robust and
<p>was advancing still further, and they saw the rmness and stability of the </p>
faithful in observing the divine commandments” (Canon 40).
