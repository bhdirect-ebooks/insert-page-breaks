<p>1 Timothy 6:3–21156</p>
<p>with God is a continual theme of Paul’s.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>Paul had previously exhorted</p>
<p>those in the larger area of Ephesus to “lead a life worthy of the calling </p>
<p>to which you have been called” (Eph 4:1 NRSV). Part of reaching for </p>
<p>eternal life includes the acknowledgement of one’s faith in Christ Jesus</p>
<p>83</p>
<p> </p>
<p>in public (confession), to be “of one mind,”</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>not hypocritical, saying</p>
<p>one thing but doing another (vs. 4:2; Titus 1:16). Jesus teaches that, if </p>
<p>humans will acknowledge or commit themselves to him publically, he </p>
<p>too will acknowledge those humans before the Father (Matt 10:32–33). </p>
<p>Paul had told the Romans that confessing Jesus is Lord before others is </p>
<p>indispensable to salvation (Rom 10:9–10). Apparently Timothy himself </p>
<p>had confessed his faith in Christ Jesus before many witnesses (6:12).</p>
<p>Paul now summarizes his appeal to Timothy: I charge, before </p>
<p>God, the one giving life to all things, and Christ Jesus, the one having </p>
<p>witnessed to Pontius Pilate the good confession, you guard the com-</p>
<p>mandment, spotless, not open to attack, until the appearing of our </p>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, which in his own time will reveal the blessed and </p>
<p>only ruler, the ruler of the ones ruling and lord of the ones being lords, </p>
<p>the only one having immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, </p>
<p>whom no one among humans saw, neither is able to see, to whom be </p>
<p>honor and power forever, amen (6:13–16). Paul again employs a word </p>
<p>family (charge) used previously for Timothy “to pass on or transmit”</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>others, but, when it has a stronger sense of a command</p>
<p>86</p>
<p> issued to Timo-</p>
<p>thy, it implies his “orders” as a “soldier” of Christ Jesus (2 Tim 2:3–5). </p>
<p>God and Jesus are Paul’s witnesses. e earlier charge had to do with </p>
<p>being impartial (5:21). is charge has to do with keeping the command-</p>
<p>ment of being not open to attack (6:14).</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>Paul picks one quality each</p>
<p>to describe God and Jesus. God is described as the one giving life to all </p>
<p>things (6:13). God as Creator gave life to all beings (4:4). God also will </p>
<p>give life to humans at the resurrection. Only God can provide eternal </p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>e quality by which Jesus is described (the one having witnessed</p>
<p>to Pontius Pilate the good confession) ts nicely in the context as a </p>
