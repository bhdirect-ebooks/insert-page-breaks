<p>1 Timothy 4:1—5:2106</p>
<p>Ephesians, the Essenes despised riches and, in contrast to Paul, usually </p>
<p>prohibited presents to relatives.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From a Gentile perspective, singleness and the forbidding of mar-</p>
<p>riage would t well with Artemis.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Artemis was a “virgin” unmarried</p>
<p>goddess. Her priests were most likely celibate or castrated men.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> A mar-</p>
<p>ried woman was punished with death if she entered her temple.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>us,</p>
<p>the Gentile environment may have encouraged this ascetic strain in Ana-</p>
<p>tolian Judaism. In the second century, about a hundred years later, the </p>
<p>Montanists, arising from Phrygia in Asia Minor, also had restrictions on </p>
<p>marriage and the promotion of rigorous fasting. e country people of </p>
<p>Phrygia and Paphlagonia were known for their “natural puritanism,” the </p>
<p>“perfect climate for a rigorist church.”</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> Montanists taught the “annul-</p>
<p>ment of marriage.” e prophetesses Maximilla and Prisca (Priscilla)</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> </p>
<p>le their own husbands (Eusebius, Hist. eccl. 5.18). Jerome added that </p>
<p>people who married a second time (even aer the death of a spouse) were </p>
<p>not to be allowed communion with the Montanist church.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>us, we can</p>
<p>see that the problems at Ephesus were to continue to develop in the later </p>
<p>church. e deprecation of one’s material self might appear pious, but </p>
<p>oen it assumes that additional sacrice is necessary to complete the full </p>
<p>ecacy of Christ’s sacrice. But the New Testament teaches that Jesus </p>
<p>is the only mediator between God and humans, the perfect sacrice for </p>
<p>human sin done “once for all.”</p>

<p>teacher Priscilla who lived a century earlier.</p>
<p>31. Jerome 2010: 292–93. Jerome even calls Tertullian’s view not to allow second </p>
<p>marriages a heresy. In the same century some taught that “ere is for you no resur-</p>
<p>rection unless you remain chaste and do not pollute the esh” (Acts Paul and ecla </p>
<p>12), and Irenaeus also notes that some Gnostics who preached abstinence from mar-</p>
<p>riage and from animal food were thus “ungrateful to the God who made all things,” </p>
<p>while other Gnostics promoted promiscuity and plurality of marriages and ate foods </p>
<p>sacriced to idols (Haer. I, 28).</p>
