<p>Godly Overseeing (3:1–16) 93</p>
<p>with another (with intent to deceive).”</p>
<p>270</p>
<p>e focus is on the words said,</p>
<p>whereas in “hypocrite” (hypokritēs, an actor or pretender), the focus is </p>
<p>on the actions, acting in a way in order to deceive others.</p>
<p>271</p>
<p>In a context</p>
<p>of heterodoxy (1:3), speaking dierently to dierent groups of people </p>
<p>might be one way to evade partisan contentious people. But, being </p>
<p>double-tongued is not a means to genuine peace. Moreover, demonic </p>
<p>teachings use “false words” to appear dierently to dierent people (4:2). </p>
<p>Only seared consciences can intend to deceive. e contrast to being </p>
<p>double-tongued might be having the mystery of the faith in a clean </p>
<p>conscience (3:9). Conscience (one aspect of the inward person that dis-</p>
<p>cerns good and evil) has been an important theme in 1 Timothy.</p>
<p>272</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>one’s conscience is pure, then one’s words should have integrity. Faith</p>
<p>273</p>
<p> </p>
<p>here resides in the context of a clean conscience. e mystery of the faith </p>
<p>will be summarized in 3:16.</p>
<p>Slander (diabolos, 3:11) is also a problem with the female elders </p>
<p>in Crete,</p>
<p>274</p>
<p>the young widows (1 Tim 5:13), and will continue to be a</p>
<p>general problem in the “last days” (2 Tim 3:3). Like the devil, who is a </p>
<p>liar, slander promotes lies or falsehoods about other people instead of </p>
<p>faith, truth, peace, righteousness, and love. Slander is a false witness; Paul </p>
<p>instead wants leaders to have a good (and true) witness (3:7). Faithful </p>
<p>in all appears to be a summary referring to the content of faith and the </p>
<p>behavior that follows from that content. e issue of faith will become </p>
<p>particularly signicant in the discussion of widows.</p>
<p>275</p>
<p>First Timothy 3:12 (Let ministers be one-woman men, managing </p>
<p>well children and their own households) appears to highlight specic </p>
<p>requirements for the male ministers as one-woman men or faithful in </p>
<p>their marital relationships and family oriented.</p>
<p>276</p>
<p> Similar to the sum-</p>
<p>mary (3:7) of the overseer discussion (3:2–6), Paul ends the discussion </p>
<p>of ministers (3:8–12) with a summary statement: For the ones having </p>
<p>served well acquire a good foothold for themselves and much con-</p>
<p>dence in the faith, the one in Christ Jesus (3:13). Serve (diakoneō) was </p>
