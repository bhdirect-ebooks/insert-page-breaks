<p>1 Timothy 2–390</p>
<p>the virtues for an “overseer” (3:2): Likewise (it is necessary) the min-</p>
<p>isters to be honorable, not double-tongued, not devoting themselves </p>
<p>to much wine, not fond of shameful gain, having the mystery of the </p>
<p>faith in a clean conscience. And let these also be tested rst, then let </p>
<p>them serve, being not open to attack (3:8–10). Paul also omits “it is </p>
<p>necessary” before the “women” in 3:11, thereby also including them in </p>
<p>the larger category of leadership of overseeing (episkopē, 3:1) and under </p>
<p>the category of “ministers” (3:8). If they were only wives of male min-</p>
<p>isters, in this context a pronoun would be needed to indicate “wife” is </p>
<p>intended.</p>
<p>263</p>
<p>Many female ministers/deacons have been discovered in the</p>
<p>early church, as well as some elders and bishops.</p>
<p>264</p>
<p>Diakonos (“servant”)</p>
<p>signies the one who renders personal service in obedience to Christ </p>
<p>and for the edication of others. e New Testament refers to two kinds </p>
<p>of ministers (1 Pet 4:10–11). e rst is a minister of the “word” who </p>
<p>equips Christians. ese ministers are believers with the gis of apostle-</p>
<p>ship, prophesy, evangelism, pastoring, and teaching (Eph 4:11–12) who </p>
<p>predominately use verbal skills. e use of minister builds on the literal </p>
<p>“servant or minister” related to a ruler, someone who personally assists </p>
<p>the ruler by making suggestions and implementing and delivering orders </p>
<p>as the ruler’s messenger (e.g., Rom 13:4). A second kind of minister or </p>
<p>“minister of ministry” (Rom 12:7) predominately meets physical needs. </p>
<p>e application of the term builds on the literal “servant or minister” who </p>
<p>serves, pays for, and supplies food and drink, shelter and clothing, such </p>
<p>as did Stephen and Dorcas.</p>
<p>265</p>
<p>Timothy, a minister (diakonos) would be a</p>
<p>“minister of the word” because he is an evangelist (1 Tim 4:6; 2 Tim 4:5). </p>
<p>263. See 1 Tim 2:11 note. See also Belleville 2009: 75–76.</p>
<p>264. E.g., Phoebe, Rom 16:1. Two female “ministers” at Bithynia-Pontus in Asia </p>
<p>Minor were tortured during Emperor Trajan’s reign (A.D. 98–117) as the leaders in </p>
<p>their congregation (Spencer 1985: 115). McKenna explains: “roughout Asia Minor </p>
<p>the deaconesses were a popular and important body of church women” (1967: 129). </p>
<p>e fourth century Const. ap. 8.19–20 records a prayer for the ordination of deacon-</p>
<p>esses which recounts the great women of the Bible. See 1 Tim 3:15. See also Horsley </p>
<p>1987: 3–4; Pursiful 2001: 10–11; Morris 1973; NewDocs 1:121; Mounce 2000: 211–212. </p>
<p>Many early church fathers, 65 inscriptions, and church canons refer to female dea-</p>
<p>cons/ministers (Madigan 2005: 19–22, 28–96, 107–30, 203, 207–10); McKenna 1967: </p>
<p>54–56, 83–91. Only later did “deaconess” refer to the wives of male deacons (McKenna </p>
<p>1967: 131). Polycarp includes qualities from both the general “ministers’” list and the </p>
<p>“women’s” list: diabolos (“slanderer”) and dilogos (“double-tongued) (3:8, 11) to show </p>
<p>that he considers them one group (Phil 5:2).</p>
<p>265. E.g., John 2:5–9; Acts 6:1–6; 9:36–42; Spencer 1985: 113–14.</p>
