<p>Keep Faith and a Good Conscience (1:18–20)</p>

<p>law structure.”</p>
<p>150</p>
<p>ey have abandoned the conscience with its organic,</p>
<p>interior ability to discuss and discern what is good and evil, with an ex-</p>
<p>ternal misuse of the law (1:8–10; 4:3–4). e conscience is guided in its </p>
<p>everyday life by faith, trust in the living God, to guide and to teach one. </p>
<p>As a result of rejecting the conscience as a “steering wheel” or a harbor </p>
<p>guide, their ship of faith has suered shipwreck (1:19). And, when a ship </p>
<p>is shipwrecked, not only are passengers wounded and made inrm, but </p>
<p>lives and cargo are lost as well.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p>Having been shipwrecked already, Hymenaeus and Alexander are </p>
<p>already in Satan’s domain because Satan is the one who causes illness, </p>
<p>inrmity, and death.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>Paul then leaves them there. He hands them over</p>
<p>(paradidōmi) to Satan (1:20). In the same way, God hands over people to </p>
<p>the results of their own evil choices.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>Although paradidōmi can be used</p>
<p>in a positive way (as in being handed over to God’s grace, its negative </p>
<p>use refers to the act of being arrested, tortured, and killed.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>Satan here</p>
<p>is “the soldier” who imprisons. Paul, though, intends that his decision to </p>
<p>hand them over will have a positive result: Hymenaeus and Alexander </p>
<p>will learn not to slander (blasphēmeō, 1:20). Apparently Hymenaeus and </p>
<p>Alexander had been acting in a diabolical way: lying, deceiving, bearing </p>
<p>false witness instead of furthering the truth, peace, righteousness, and </p>
<p>love.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p>Paul has allowed them to remain in this severe type of discipline</p>
<p>because, unlike Paul, they did not sin out of ignorance, and, unlike the </p>
<p>women in 2:11–14, they were not deceived out of lack of education. Ap-</p>
<p>parently Hymenaeus did not learn not to slander because he continued </p>
<p>to swerve from the truth by claiming that the resurrection had already </p>
<p>taken place. Paul concluded then that Hymenaeus was not “God’s” (2 </p>
<p>Tim 2:17–19).</p>
