<p>teachings. Linda M. Maloney agrees: “Clearly, the issue of the letters’ au-</p>
<p>thority is in some sense connected with their authorship.”</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>eir context</p>
<p>would be second century developed Gnosticism and a church over one </p>
<p>hundred years later. If Paul is not the author, who is? If we cannot trust </p>
<p>when the author writes “Paul” and “Timothy,” how can we trust the writer </p>
<p>who says: “the one mediator between God and humankind, Christ Jesus, </p>
<p>himself human, who gave himself a ransom for all” (1 Tim 2:5–6 NRSV)? </p>
<p>And, why should we do what the letters say?</p>
<p>Historical Context</p>
<p>If, however, we trust the information given to us in the Pastoral Letters </p>
<p>(as this author does) and assume Paul completed his plans, we may posit </p>
<p>the following possible historical reconstruction:</p>
<p>1. Paul and Timothy leave Paul’s house arrest in Rome (c. A.D. 61–62).</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>2. Possibly, Paul may have traveled to Spain (Rom 15:24, 28), probably </p>
<p>arriving at the central Roman port of Dertosa (Tortosa) (if not later </p>
<p>aer leaving Nicopolis, Achaia).</p>
<p>3. Paul and Titus travel to Crete. Paul leaves Titus behind (Titus 1:5). </p>
<p>Possibly, Timothy had been in Crete as well or he went directly to </p>
<p>Ephesus.</p>
<p>4. Paul and Timothy travel to Ephesus, Asia. Timothy remains (1 Tim </p>
<p>1:3).</p>
<p>5. Paul visits Colossae (Phlm 22).</p>
<p>6. Paul travels to Philippi, Macedonia, and probably writes Titus and 1 </p>
<p>Timothy from Macedonia (Phil 2:24; 1 Tim 1:3).</p>
<p>7. Paul winters in Nicopolis, Achaia, where he meets Titus (Titus 3:12).</p>
<p>8. Paul visits Corinth, Achaia (2 Tim 4:20).</p>
<p>9. Paul meets Timothy in Ephesus, Asia (1 Tim 3:14; 4:13; 2 Tim 4:12).</p>
<p>10. Paul visits nearby Miletus (2 Tim 4:20).</p>
<p>11. Paul travels to the seaport Troas, Asia. He is not supported by Chris-</p>
<p>tians in Asia (2 Tim 1:15; 4:13–14).</p>
<p>39. Maloney 1994: 362.</p>
<p>40. Acts 28:14–31; Phil 1:1; 2:19, 23; Col 1:1; Phlm 1, 22.</p>
