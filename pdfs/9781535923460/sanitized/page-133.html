<p>Timothy Should Become an Example (4:11—5:2) 117</p>
<p>Paul commands Timothy not to neglect the gi, whereas in 2 Timothy </p>
<p>1:6, he is told to “rekindle” the gi. e dierence though is whether the </p>
<p>hands are those of the council of elders (1 Tim 4:14) or of Paul (2 Tim </p>
<p>1:6). Also, 1 Timothy refers to prophecies (4:14; 1:18) but 2 Timothy 1:6 </p>
<p>does not. Does Paul, then, refer to the same or dierent events? It could </p>
<p>be the same event</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>if Paul were part of the council of elders and for</p>
<p>some reason he decides to highlight his personal part in the process in 2 </p>
<p>Timothy.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>Paul further explains how Timothy is to be an example (4:12): Keep </p>
<p>on practicing these things, live among these, that your progress may </p>
<p>be visible to all (4:15). What Paul has urged Timothy to do, he must </p>
<p>keep on practicing or “cultivating”</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>(as opposed to neglecting, 4:14).</p>
<p>Paul states his commands in a positive way in 4:13 (“keep on occupying </p>
<p>yourself ”), in a negative way in verse 14 (“do not neglect”),</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>and again</p>
<p>in a positive way (keep practicing, 4:15). erefore, the positive is ac-</p>
<p>centuated. Timothy is to take care (meletaō)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>to do all Paul has exhorted in </p>
<p>4:12–13 (become an example, pay attention to reading, encouragement, </p>
<p>teaching, not neglect spiritual gi). is verb is “used by the Greeks of </p>
<p>107. E.g., Robertson 1931: 581 vs. Towner 2006: 325 (2 Tim 1:6 is an earlier event).</p>
<p>108. Normally, a church has a group of elders. Using a group of elders to lead has </p>
<p>a long history in Judaism. (See Titus 1:5; 1 Tim 3:2.) e presbuterion continued at </p>
<p>Ephesus even to the second century (Ignatius, Eph. 2:2; 4:1; 20:2). e Sanhedrin in </p>
<p>Jerusalem (which consisted of high priests and scribes) was also called the council of </p>
<p>elders (presbuterion) (Luke 22:66; Acts 22:5.) In the N.T., they dealt with judicial ques-</p>
<p>tions. Moses had 70–72 elders to help him with judicial questions in Israel. e laying </p>
<p>on of hands was a symbolic act, accompanied by prayer, to commission people to a </p>
<p>specic task (Acts 6:6; 13:3). When God commanded Moses to commission Joshua as </p>
<p>his successor, Joshua already was indwelt by the Holy Spirit before the commissioning </p>
<p>(Num 27:18–23). Joshua had previously been chosen by God as Moses’ successor but </p>
<p>the commissioning was now to be done before the congregation to indicate God’s ap-</p>
<p>proval of Joshua’s role. Also in Acts 13:2–3, the Holy Spirit commands Barnabas and </p>
<p>Saul be set apart for a work before they are commissioned by prayer and the laying </p>
<p>on of hands. When the elders commissioned Timothy, they asked God to give or to </p>
<p>conrm his spiritual gi of evangelism as a blessing for his ministry.</p>
<p>109. Spencer 1998b: 126–27. Because of the close relationship between Paul </p>
<p>and Timothy, Paul can use the imperative thirteen times in only eighteen verses or </p>
<p>nine sentences. e imperatives are: “decline,” “train,” 4:7; “command,” “teach,” 4:11; </p>
<p>“despise,” “become,” 4:12; “occupy,” 4:13; “do not neglect,” 4:14; “practice,” “be,” 4:15; </p>
<p>“pay attention to,” “persevere,” 4:16; “appeal,” 5:1. Even 5:3 begins with an imperative: </p>
<p>“honor,” 5:3.</p>
<p>110. E.g., Matt 22:5.</p>
