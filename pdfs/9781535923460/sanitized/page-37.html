<p>1 TIMOTHY 1</p>
<p>Warn False Teachers</p>
<p>Introduction (1:1–2)</p>
<p>Paul begins his letter in the traditional format, giving the name of the </p>
<p>writer, then the recipient, and nally the salutation: Paul, apostle of </p>
<p>Christ Jesus, because of command from our Savior God and our hope </p>
<p>Christ Jesus, to Timothy, genuine child in faith: grace, mercy, peace </p>
<p>from Father-God and our Lord Christ Jesus (1:1–2). Paul frequently </p>
<p>describes himself as an apostle of Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> What makes this in-</p>
<p>troduction distinct is that Paul highlights God as Savior and Jesus as </p>
<p>hope. Hope and savior are also mentioned in Paul’s introductory words </p>
<p>to Titus (1:2–4), but in no other introduction by Paul.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>us, although</p>
<p>the “savior/save” word family is less frequent in 1 Timothy than in Titus, </p>
<p>nevertheless the theme of God as Savior appears at signicant points in </p>
<p>1 Timothy.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Paul is concerned that Timothy communicate God’s concern</p>
<p>to save: sinners (e.g., Paul, 1:15), everyone, including rulers, men and </p>
<p>women (2:1–14), believers and nonbelievers (2:1; 4:10, 16), and even </p>
<p>Timothy (4:16). </p>
<p>e themes of God as savior and hope reoccur in 4:10, where we </p>
<p>learn that believers have hope because God saves. God gives hope also </p>
<p>because God provides for the needy and the wealthy (5:5; 6:17). But, </p>
<p>why is Jesus specically our hope (1:1)? Jesus gives hope because he </p>
<p>strengthens believers, appoints them to service, and, most of all, gives </p>
<p>mercy, and overows with grace toward sinners, which results in eternal </p>
<p>life (1:12–16). Jesus is the victorious mediator between God and humans, </p>
<p>1. 1 Tim 1:1; 2 Tim 1:1; Titus 1:1; 1 Cor 1:1; 2 Cor 1:1; Gal 1:1; Eph 1:1; Col 1:1; and </p>
<p>simply as “apostle” in Rom 1:1.</p>
<p>2. Only 2 Pet 1:1 refers to “our God and Savior Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>3. See Titus 1:3; 2:13; 1 Tim 1:15; 2:3–4, 15; 4:10, 16.</p>
