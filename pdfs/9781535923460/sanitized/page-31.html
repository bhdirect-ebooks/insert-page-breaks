<p>Introduction to 1 and 2 Timothy 15</p>
<p>At least as early as A.D. 400s, Bible scholars have been elaborating </p>
<p>on the worship of Artemis as background for the New Testament let-</p>
<p>ters.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Pausanias summarizes the ancient sentiment: “All cities worship</p>
Artemis of Ephesus, and individuals hold her in honour above all the
<p>gods. e reason, in my view, is the renown of the Amazons, who tradi-</p>
<p>tionally dedicated the image, also the extreme antiquity of this sanctuary. </p>
<p>ree other points as well have contributed to her renown, the size of the </p>
<p>temple, surpassing all buildings among men, the eminence of the city of </p>
<p>the Ephesians and the renown of the goddess who dwells there.”</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>temple was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. When An-</p>
<p>tipater saw the temple “that mounted to the clouds,” the other wonders </p>
<p>lost their brilliancy for, “Lo, apart from Olympus, the Sun never looked </p>
<p>on aught so grand!”</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Artemis, huntress, queen of beasts, is included in the battles be-</p>
<p>tween the gods by Homer (Il. 21 [535]). Euripides calls her “Maid of the </p>
<p>mountain-wild.”</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> Ancient religions were syncretistic. Possibly the earli-</p>
<p>est temple at Ephesus was dedicated to Cybele and Demeter.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>e queen</p>
<p>bee was the original predominant model for the goddess. e Greek por-</p>
<p>trayal of the deities as anthropomorphic was combined with the earlier </p>
<p>Anatolian more animalistic portrayals of deity.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>us, the Artemis at</p>
<p>Ephesus has the face of a woman but her long tapered skirt resembles </p>
<p>the tapered abdomen of the queen bee. e Ephesian Artemis’ chest is </p>
<p>covered by her many eggs or ova.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>e priestesses were called Melissae</p>
<p>(“worker bees”) and priests were called Essenes (“drones”).</p>

<p>with brother Apollo by the Cenchrius River in the area of Ephesus. eir parents were </p>
<p>Zeus and Leto (Strabo, Geogr. 14.1.20 [C639–40]). Artemis was oen pictured with </p>
<p>bow and arrow and stag. Delos also claimed to be the birthplace of Artemis.</p>

<p>nourishment to the baby Zeus in some legends (Nilsson 1971: 542–44). e main </p>
<p>function of a queen bee is to lay eggs and found new hives. is mother and queen </p>
<p>bee “guided her swarming people” to their new abode (Ramsay 1994: 157). Xenophon </p>
