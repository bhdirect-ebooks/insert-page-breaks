<p>Conclusion of the Last Battle: e Raising of the Dead for Judgment</p>

purity of this nal divine event in the context of so much that is dark.
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In any case, that this event marks the end is further emphasized by </p>
<p>John’s noting that the earth and the heavens ed from his [i.e., the One </p>
<p>seated on the throne] presence, which is so all-consuming that there </p>
<p>was no longer any place for them (“the earth and the heavens”). And </p>
<p>all of this because the next scene in the narrative is about “a new heaven </p>
<p>and a new earth,” all of which has been dictated by Isaiah 65:17–25.</p>
<p>But the new order appears as the nal earthly event in 21:1–8. e </p>
<p>present concern is with the nal destruction of evil. To get there John </p>
<p>very briey presents the dead as standing before the throne, with em-</p>
<p>phasis on the fact that it was all of the dead, both great and small, the </p>
<p>latter probably referring not to children but to people of seemingly lesser </p>
<p>importance on the world’s stage, including slaves. us all of the world’s </p>
<p>people are here seen as “standing before” God as books were opened, </p>
<p>thus echoing Daniel 7:10. e implication of this imagery is that these </p>
books, as with those in Daniel, contain the divine judgments on the
<p>wicked, since John goes on to narrate that another book was opened, </p>
<p>described as the book of life. What lies behind all this, of course, is an </p>
<p>understanding that records are being kept in heaven, on the basis of </p>
which divine justice will be meted out. us in the present scene all the
<p>dead were judged according to what they had done, which deeds had </p>
<p>been recorded in the books (plural).</p>
<p>Further to emphasize the totality of the present scene of judgment, </p>
<p>John repeats what he has just written, but now with the various loca-</p>
<p>tions of the dead. First, the sea gave up the dead that were in it; and </p>
<p>second, those buried on the land, thus death and Hades gave up the </p>
<p>dead that were in them, so that, to repeat what he had just written, </p>
<p>everyone was judged according to what they had done. And with that, </p>
<p>and in order to have nothing like this appear in the nal scenes of the </p>
<p>book, the nal judgment is against death and Hades themselves: they </p>
<p>too were thrown into the lake of re. John then identies the “lake of </p>
<p>re” as the second death, almost certainly meaning an eternal death </p>
<p>following one’s earthly dying. Finally, as the very last word of this kind </p>
<p>in the book, John summarizes, All those whose names were not found </p>
<p>written in the book of life were thrown into the lake of re. And with </p>
<p>14. It is also possible, since so much of this scene is derived from Dan 7:9–10, that </p>
<p>John is here picking up Daniel’s imagery of the white clothing and white hair of “the </p>
<p>Ancient of Days.”</p>
