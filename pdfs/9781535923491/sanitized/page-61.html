<p>To the Church in yatira</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>ing promoted in yatira, and feet that “will strike [Jezebel’s] children </p>
<p>dead.”</p>
<p>Even so, the Lord himself does not begin there, but with a return </p>
<p>to the phrase that appears in the rst letter, and will recur in the fol-</p>
<p>lowing three: I know your deeds. As with Ephesus, this turns out to </p>
<p>be a considerable commendation. First, they are recognized for their </p>
<p>love and faith, a striking reversal of the normal—and thus expected—</p>
<p>order of these two virtues. e apparent reason for this is found in what </p>
<p>comes next, where your service and perseverance appear intention-</p>
<p>ally to correspond to the two virtues—their love had led to service and </p>
<p>their faith to perseverance. e third commendation, that you are now </p>
<p>doing more than you did at rst, is somewhat ambiguous from our </p>
<p>distance; most likely the “doing more” is related to their “love,” which </p>
<p>has produced their “service.”</p>
<p>is opening commendation, therefore, leaves one quite unpre-</p>
<p>pared to hear</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>next, Nevertheless, I have this against you. e reason</p>
<p>such commendation could be forthcoming in light of what follows lies </p>
<p>with the verb you tolerate. us what emerges next is not the strong </p>
<p>condemnation of a church that has capitulated to false teaching; rather </p>
<p>it has allowed such teaching to go on unchecked. e imagery in this </p>
<p>case is especially striking and therefore powerful. e woman respon-</p>
<p>sible for promoting the false teaching styles herself a prophet, so that </p>
<p>she misleads [apparently some, but not all of] my servants. What they </p>
<p>are being misled to believe is that one can follow Christ and at the same </p>
<p>time engage in some of the pagan practices as well. Most likely this </p>
<p>would have been done for the sake of accommodation, so that one could </p>
<p>be a part of the believing community in yatira without losing one’s </p>
<p>friends and (especially) one’s position in the trade guilds. e argument </p>
<p>in this case could apparently be made quite persuasively: one is merely </p>
<p>eating, not worshiping the god in whose honor the meal is being eaten. </p>
<p>And as for sexual immorality, this is biblical language altogether; very </p>
<p>few in the Greco-Roman world ever have considered sexual relation-</p>
<p>14. One must say “hear” at this point because the majority of the recipients of this </p>
<p>document will have it read to them, in a culture where only about 15–20 percent could </p>
<p>read or write. Indeed, the presupposition lying behind all the NT documents is that the </p>
<p>recipients will have it read aloud to them in community, vis-à-vis the “silent reading” </p>
<p>common to our culture.</p>
