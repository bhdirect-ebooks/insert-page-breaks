<p>Rome as a Seductive Harlot</p>
<p>235</p>
<p>All of this, of course, is introduction, setting the scene for the in-</p>
<p>terpretation that is to come, which, as John will say a bit further on, </p>
<p>“calls for a mind of wisdom” (v. 9).</p>
<p>e Interpretation of the Vision (17:7–18)</p>
<p>What comes next in John’s narrative is a series of interpretations, begin-</p>
<p>ning with the beast itself and concluding with a prophetic word about </p>
<p>her future. As clear as the following interpretation is in most of its parts, </p>
<p>there are just enough moments of doubt to cause one to be less than </p>
<p>dogmatic. is is especially so regarding the seven kings of verse 10, </p>
<p>an interpretation on John’s part that has generally played havoc with </p>
<p>our later attempts to t the book into what we know about the Roman </p>
<p>emperors in the rst Christian century. So one identies some of these </p>
<p>gures with a measure of hesitation, especially since we cannot be sure </p>
<p>from our perspective of history whether John begins his count with </p>
<p>Augustus or Julius Caesar (most likely the former) and whether he </p>
<p>includes the three “emperors” of quick succession who followed Nero </p>
<p>in 69 CE. Furthermore, and most troubling of all for many later inter-</p>
<p>preters like ourselves, is John’s prediction of the coming destruction of </p>
<p>the Empire as he knew it within what appears to be a short time in his </p>
<p>future. Or to put our dilemma another way, it is altogether unlikely that </p>
<p>John’s rst readers could have possibly read it the way we do from hind-</p>
<p>sight. At issue, in any case, is what they were intended to understand </p>
<p>in foresight.</p>
<p>e Interpretation of the Beast (17:7–8)</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>en the angel said to me: “Why are you astonished? I will ex-</p>
<p>plain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides, </p>
<p>which has the seven heads and ten horns. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>e beast, which you </p>
<p>saw, once was, now is not, and yet will come up out of the Abyss </p>
<p>and go to its destruction. e inhabitants of the earth whose </p>
<p>names have not been written in the book of life from the creation </p>
<p>of the world will be astonished when they see the beast, because it </p>
<p>once was, now is not, and yet will come.</p>
<p>John begins his interpretation of the vision not with an explanation of </p>
<p>the woman, who was the dominant gure in the preceding description, </p>
