<p>John’s Response and the Lord’s Command</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>created being, even an angel (see Rev 22:8–9). While John was in this </p>
<p>position, Christ placed his right hand on me, the same hand that held </p>
<p>the seven stars. At the same time this scene echoes Daniel’s experience </p>
<p>in 10:10 and 18. e rst words John hears, do not be afraid, are the </p>
<p>typical biblical response to one who nds favor in the context of such </p>
<p>a vision or encounter. In this case it is almost certainly an intentional </p>
<p>echo of Isaiah 44:2 (cf. Dan 10:12; Luke 1:13, 30), given the source of </p>
<p>the next phrase.</p>
<p>What immediately follows are words of identication, which at </p>
<p>once both echo what God had said of himself in verse 8 and then iden-</p>
<p>tify the speaker in terms that can refer only to the risen Christ. us </p>
<p>Christ begins, I am the First and the Last, language used by Yahweh to </p>
<p>identify himself in Isaiah 44:6 (cf. 48:12) and used by John to identify </p>
<p>God in verse 8 above as “the Alpha and the Omega.” It is now used </p>
<p>by the living Christ as a means of self-identity, again reecting John’s </p>
<p>especially high Christology. e same is true of the second identier, </p>
<p>I am the Living One, which is the ultimate identier of Israel’s God, </p>
<p>Yahweh (see e.g., Deut 32:40; cf. Rev 4:9). But in this case, this language </p>
<p>takes on its own special meaning by the next identiers: I was dead and </p>
<p>now look, I am alive for ever and ever! (the latter term also echoing </p>
<p>Deut 32:40). us, and without attempting to explain the impossible, </p>
<p>the One who is both “the First and the Last,” and is therefore “the Living </p>
<p>One,” is so in a special sense in the person of the Son of God, since in his </p>
<p>humanity he also experienced death and resurrection. In the marvelous </p>
<p>language of Charles Wesley, “‘Tis mystery all; the Immortal dies.”</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>for John the emphasis now lies solely on the fact that the one who “was </p>
<p>dead” is now “alive for ever and ever!”</p>
<p>But that is not all; the once dead, now living Eternal One, by way </p>
<p>of his own death and resurrection now holds the keys of death and </p>
<p>Hades. Two matters are being asserted here by John: rst, Christ him-</p>
<p>self has been raised from the dead to live forever; and second, in so </p>
<p>doing he has stripped death and hell of their power. As a great preacher </p>
<p>in the black tradition once told it on an Easter Sunday, playing the role </p>
<p>of Satan, he shouted to the demonic host, “He’s got away! He’s got away! </p>
<p>And He’s got the keys!”</p>
<p>16. “And Can It Be?” (1738).</p>
