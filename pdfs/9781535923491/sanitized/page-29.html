<p>be the rst of some two hundred echoes of, or references to, John’s and </p>
<p>his readers’ Bible, which we now know as the “Old Testament.”</p>
<p>In especially Christian fashion John also includes the exalted Son </p>
<p>of God as the source of the “grace and peace” he wishes for them. us </p>
<p>he adds and from Jesus Christ, who is then identied by three further </p>
<p>phrases, each of which is especially pertinent to the “Revelation” that </p>
<p>follows. And just as the designations for God the Father and the Spirit </p>
<p>are derived from the Old Testament, so are these for Christ—in this </p>
<p>case from the very important Psalm 89, which begins (vv. 1–37) as a </p>
<p>song of rapturous delight in the Davidic kingship but ends (vv. 38–51) </p>
<p>as a bitter lament over its present demise (from the perspective of Ethan </p>
<p>the Ezrahite).</p>
<p>First, Christ is the faithful witness, language derived from (but </p>
<p>not reecting the context of) Psalm 89:37, where “the moon” is called </p>
<p>“the faithful witness in the sky.” at language is now transferred to </p>
<p>Christ. e word translated “witness” (martyrus), which eventually </p>
<p>came to mean “martyr,” is here a forensic term, and thus a live metaphor </p>
<p>for John, reecting Christ’s having stood trial and then being sentenced </p>
<p>to death. Indeed, this language will occur again only in 2:10 and 13, </p>
<p>where it clearly refers to those who have borne witness “unto death.” </p>
<p>us “Antipas, my faithful witness, . . . was put to death in your city” </p>
<p>(2:13). In turn these linguistic realities are what caused the Greek word </p>
<p>to make its way into English not as a word for “witness” but as a refer-</p>
<p>ence to someone who is put to death by others “on behalf of any belief, </p>
<p>principle, or cause.”</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>But, second, Christ is also the rstborn from the dead, language </p>
<p>that echoes Psalm 89:27 (“I will appoint him to be my rstborn”), a </p>
<p>passage that reects the psalmist’s condence in the continuation of </p>
<p>the Davidic kingship. Here is language that carried meaning for John’s </p>
<p>own readers but could get lost on contemporary ones, since it is based </p>
<p>on the reality of primogeniture in these cultures, where the rstborn </p>
<p>son was the primary heir, and thus had both position and privilege. e </p>
<p>signicance of this designation is to be found in Exodus 4:22, where </p>
<p>Yahweh says to Pharaoh, “Israel is my rstborn son”—even though </p>
<p>historically he was in fact second. Eventually this language was applied </p>
<p>to David and his heirs (see esp. Ps 2:2 and 7, where the Davidic king </p>
<p>6. From the Random House American College Dictionary.</p>
