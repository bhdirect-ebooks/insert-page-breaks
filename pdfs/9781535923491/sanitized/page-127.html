<p>An Interlude in Two Parts</p>

<p>ation of what began in 6:1 and concludes at 8:1–5, which at the same </p>
<p>time serves to introduce the next major section of the narrative. Not </p>
<p>only has there been no explicit relocation of John himself, but as verse 9 </p>
<p>makes clear, he is still in the same vision (“Aer this I looked and there </p>
<p>before me was a great multitude that no one could count . . . standing </p>
<p>before the throne and in front of the Lamb”). is is further supported </p>
<p>by verses 11 and 13 (“All the angels were standing around the throne </p>
<p>and around the elders and the four living creatures” and “then one of </p>
<p>the elders asked me”). Nonetheless, even though John is himself still in </p>
<p>heaven, the concern is now altogether with what is to happen on earth.</p>
<p>What one must take seriously in the present vision—in keep-</p>
<p>ing with other key moments in the book—is the reality that the earth </p>
<p>itself is going to feel the eects of God’s judgments. us the winds </p>
<p>pictured here as about to harm the earth join with the preceding earth-</p>
<p>quake (6:12–17), plus the plagues of the rst four trumpets that follow </p>
<p>(8:6–13) and the rst four bowls in 16:1–9, to describe God’s wrath in </p>
<p>terms of the earth taking a beating, as a part of God’s meting out his </p>
<p>judgments. is is tied ultimately to the reality of God as Creator of all </p>
<p>that is, and that what God created was good; but as the Genesis account </p>
<p>makes plain, the whole created order was somehow aected by the fall, </p>
<p>so that it would “produce thorns and thistles.” Similarly, the Noacic </p>
<p>covenant that followed the judgment of the ood included a promise of </p>
<p>a kind of “eternal earth.” at promise then took a decided shi in the </p>
<p>Prophets, beginning with Isaiah. Part of his prophetic vision, expressed </p>
<p>eschatologically in 65:17 and 66:22, was that God would create a new </p>
<p>earth—not dierent from the present one, but this one renewed and </p>
<p>fully restored.</p>
<p>John’s Revelation thus concludes with the full expression of that </p>
<p>hope, with a “new heavens and a new earth,” including the heavenly </p>
<p>Jerusalem coming down on this now renewed earth. is view of things </p>
<p>nds its beginnings in the present anticipatory vision, where the pres-</p>
<p>ent earth is going to be roughed up, as part of God’s judgments against </p>
<p>“those who dwell on the earth,” a Johannine idiom for those who have </p>
<p>rejected God by preferring the creature to the Creator. us the pres-</p>
<p>ent vision begins with the four angels holding back the winds that are </p>
<p>poised to blow on the earth as a form of judgment.</p>
