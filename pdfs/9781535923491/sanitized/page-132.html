<p>Revelation 7:9–17</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>and wisdom and thanks and honor</p>
<p>and power and strength</p>
<p>be to our God for ever and ever.</p>
<p>Amen!”</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>en one of the elders asked me, “ese in white robes—</p>
<p>who are they, and where did they come from?”</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>I answered, “Sir, you know.”</p>
<p>And he said, “ese are they who have come out of the great </p>
<p>tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in </p>
<p>the blood of the Lamb.</p>
<p> 15</p>
<p>erefore,</p>
<p>they are before the throne of God</p>
<p> and serve him in his temple;</p>
<p>and he who sits on the throne will shelter them with his </p>
<p>presence.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>‘Never again will they hunger</p>
<p> never again will they thirst.</p>
<p>e sun will not beat down on them,’</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> nor any scorching heat.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their </p>
<p>shepherd;</p>
<p> ‘he will lead them to springs of living water.’a</p>
<p>‘And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.’”</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>In one of the truly remarkable moments in his Apocalypse, John has </p>
<p>achieved maximum mileage from his vision of heaven</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>by means of</p>
<p>the present picture of the “great multitude” in “white robes.” e vi-</p>
<p>sion itself is in two major parts, each of which is also in two parts. In </p>
<p>verses 9–12 the multitude is rst described in their heavenly setting </p>
<p>(vv. 9–10) as those who have obtained salvation, to which the whole </p>
<p>host of angels then responds with worship (vv. 11–12). In verses 13–17 </p>
<p>John is rst informed as to who they are (vv. 13–14) and then is given a </p>
<p>description of their nal, heavenly triumph (vv. 15–17). Again worship </p>
<p>is a predominant motif, but in this case it is also accompanied by an </p>
<p>armation of the nal eschatological security of those who belong to </p>
<p>Christ. us this second scene in the interlude serves as a further word </p>
<p>2. Isaiah 49:10.</p>
<p>3. Isaiah 25:8.</p>
<p>4. In the narrative itself John is still an earthly observer in heaven, which is made </p>
<p>certain in this case by the narrative that follows: “and there before me was a great </p>
<p>multitude.”</p>
