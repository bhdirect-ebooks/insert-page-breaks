<p>Revelation 18:1—19:10</p>
<p>246</p>
<p>In typical prophetic fashion, this judgment on Rome is followed by </p>
<p>the reasons for it, again expressed with a doublet. First, those coming </p>
<p>under judgment with her are the nations and their leaders, the kings of </p>
<p>the earth, who have “fornicated” with her. Second, and now for the rst </p>
<p>time in the narrative itself, judgment also awaits those who have helped </p>
<p>to make her fabulously wealthy, the merchants of the earth. e for-</p>
<p>mer, “the kings of the earth,” are denounced because they have commit-</p>
<p>ted adultery with her, while the latter are noted as having grown rich </p>
<p>from her excessive luxuries. Although these “merchants of the earth” </p>
<p>appear only here in the Revelation, they will get the greater press in the </p>
<p>present denunciations—evidence that John as a Christian prophet sees </p>
<p>clearly the connections between Rome’s military and economic power. </p>
<p>But before he goes on to the laments of the three major groups, John </p>
<p>adds a further oracle in which he calls on God’s people to “come out </p>
<p>of her,” while at the same time elaborating on several themes from the </p>
<p>opening lament.</p>
<p>Warning to Escape Babylon’s Judgment (18:4–8)</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>en I heard another voice from heaven say:</p>
<p> “‘Come out of her, my people,’</p>
<p> so that you will not share in her sins,</p>
<p> so that you will not receive any of her plagues;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>for her sins are piled up to heaven,</p>
<p> and God has remembered her crimes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Give back to her as she has given;</p>
<p> pay her back double for what she has done.</p>
<p> Pour her a double portion from her own cup.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Give her as much torment and grief</p>
<p> as the glory and luxury she gave herself.</p>
<p> In her heart she boasts,</p>
<p> ‘I sit enthroned as queen.</p>
<p> I am not a widow;’</p>
<p> I will never mourn.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>erefore in one day her plagues will overtake her:</p>
<p> death, mourning and famine.</p>
<p> She will be consumed by re,</p>
<p> for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.</p>
