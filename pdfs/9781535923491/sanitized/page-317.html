<p>Introduction: A New Heaven and a New Earth</p>

<p>is most likely intended also as a warning for John’s readers. us those </p>
<p>on the outside, who are identied rst in a rather remarkable way as the </p>
<p>cowardly and the unbelieving, are promised the exact opposite: they </p>
<p>will be consigned to the ery lake of burning sulfur, mentioned in the </p>
<p>rst of the two paragraphs immediately preceding this passage (20:10), </p>
<p>which is there also described as the second death (20:14). Most likely </p>
<p>John begins with this twofold description (“cowardly” and “unbeliev-</p>
<p>ing”) as fair warning to his readers in Asia Minor.</p>
<p>e rest of the list, which begins with a generalizing descriptor, </p>
<p>the vile, then proceeds to echo the similar condemnation at the end of </p>
<p>chapter 9 (vv. 20–21), which, as in that case, for the most part reects </p>
<p>portions of the Ten Commandments: murderers (sixth), the sexually </p>
<p>immoral (seventh), idolaters (second), and all liars (a contemporized </p>
<p>version of the ninth). But inserted into the middle of this list, and reect-</p>
<p>ing a condemnation from the Prophets (Isaiah 47:12; Ezekiel 13:18–20), </p>
<p>are those who practice magic arts. In John’s case this is most likely </p>
<p>directed at the emperor’s “magicians,” the priests of the emperor cult, </p>
who were condemned in 13:13 above. us from the divine perspective
<p>those who “conquer” are the ones who inherit the future, while those </p>
<p>who live in unbelief and idolatry will “inherit” the lake of re.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem, the Bride of the Lamb (21:9–27)</p>
<p>What comes rst in the new creation (v. 5) is a restored Jerusalem—a </p>
<p>restoration of all of its parts except for the temple. e latter is purposely </p>
<p>omitted because God’s people are now eternally in the presence of God </p>
<p>and the Lamb, hence a temple is unnecessary (v. 22). e restoration </p>
<p>itself is given in three distinct parts: verses 11–21 give a physical de-</p>
<p>scription of the city; verses 22–27 then describe the character of the city, </p>
<p>while 22:1–5 sees the city transformed into a restored garden of Eden. </p>
<p>us, having been taken to a high mountain so that he may see the city </p>
<p>for himself, John begins by describing its overall glory (vv. 9–11), before </p>
<p>focusing on its walls and its gates (vv. 12–14). at is followed by an </p>
<p>accompanying angel’s measuring its gates and walls (vv. 15–21), while </p>
<p>the scene is concluded by noting the absence of the former Jerusalem’s </p>
<p>most distinguished structure, its temple (vv. 22–27). Such a temple, </p>
<p>the earthly location of God’s presence among his people, is no longer </p>
<p>necessary because God and the Lamb are present together as its eternal </p>
