<p>Revelation 2:18–29</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>ships outside of the marriage bond (at least with temple prostitutes) to </p>
<p>be a form of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Christ’s response to “Jezebel” and her false teaching has several di-</p>
<p>mensions to it. First, he tried to rescue the woman herself: I have given </p>
<p>her time to repent of her immorality. is suggests that the present </p>
<p>letter is not the rst time Christ has tried to deal with her. But as with </p>
<p>most such false teachings, repentance is neither sought nor wanted; </p>
<p>thus she is unwilling. As a way of catching her attention, Christ intends </p>
<p>to bring her low by physical suering. What follows, therefore, is to be </p>
<p>understood as a warning—both for the false prophet herself and for </p>
<p>those who would pay her any attention. e rst step will be to cast her </p>
<p>on a bed of suering, which will also be extended to those who have </p>
<p>chosen to follow her: I will make those who commit adultery with </p>
<p>her suer intensely as well, but only if they do not repent of her ways. </p>
<p>Very likely the phrase “cast her on a bed” is intended as irony: her “bed” </p>
<p>as the place of harlotry is now a place of illness, since she is playing the </p>
<p>role of a harlot with regard to the truth.</p>
<p>e second step in her judgment, I will strike her children dead, </p>
<p>is one of the more puzzling moments in the book, as to whether, or to </p>
<p>what degree, this language is to be understood literally or guratively. </p>
<p>e rst dimension of the puzzle lies with the words “her children.” </p>
<p>Does this refer to literal physical children of Jezebel herself, where the </p>
<p>implication is that she is the wife of someone in the community? Or is </p>
<p>it an allusion to her “spiritual children,” those who have become so by </p>
<p>being persuaded by her palaver? Although one cannot be sure, in light </p>
<p>of the concerns of the letter and of the whole book, the latter seems to </p>
<p>be the more likely. It is not personal vindictiveness against the woman’s </p>
<p>own ospring that concerns Christ, but the necessity to bring an end to </p>
<p>those who have become her spiritual ospring.</p>
<p>e second part of the puzzle lies with the verb “strike dead.” </p>
<p>Again, is this intended to be a literal judgment on them for allowing </p>
<p>themselves to be duped by foolishness? Or does this refer to the nal </p>
<p>outcome of their suering if they do not repent and thus come to their </p>
<p>senses? e answer in this case is much more dicult to determine, </p>
<p>but all things considered in the context of the Revelation as a whole, it </p>
<p>would seem most likely to refer to more immediate “death,” which at the </p>
<p>same time would leave them without any hope of a future with Christ </p>
