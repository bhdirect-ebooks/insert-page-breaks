<p>Revelation 6:1–17</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>you judge the inhabitants of the earth?” As such, and like its prede-</p>
<p>cessor, the opening of this seal further anticipates the nal judgment </p>
<p>described later in 16:16–21 and 20:7–15. In this case, however, the </p>
<p>answer is not an immediate response, in light of what they are told, </p>
<p>but God’s ultimate response—God’s judgments poured out especially </p>
<p>on those responsible for the martyrdoms described in the opening of </p>
<p>the preceding seal. John’s own place in the vision now moves from the </p>
<p>preceding “I looked”/“I saw” to the more anticipatory I watched as he </p>
<p>opened the sixth seal. e judgment itself is expressed in terms of a </p>
<p>great earthquake, a phenomenon used twice by the prophets as a sym-</p>
<p>bol of God’s wrath and/or judgment,</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>and which occurs elsewhere in</p>
<p>this book either in these terms or as a prelude to God’s judgments (8:5; </p>
<p>11:13, 19; 16:17–21).</p>
<p>e description that follows begins with a graphic portrayal of </p>
<p>the supernatural phenomena that aect the entire known universe, </p>
<p>beginning with the heavenly bodies (vv. 12–14) and concluding with </p>
<p>the human response to it—from the mighty (“kings”/“princes”) to the </p>
<p>weak and lowly, including slaves (vv. 15–17). us, rst up is the sun, </p>
<p>which turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>us the rst</p>
<p>cosmic wonder is the darkening of the sun, the source of both light and </p>
<p>life on the earth. Next up is the moon, described as the whole moon, </p>
<p>which turned blood red. It seems very likely that with these descrip-</p>
<p>tions John intends his readers to see the cosmos as in mourning over </p>
<p>the events on earth, brought on by the earthquake. e cosmic collapse </p>
<p>is so total, going beyond the sun and moon to include the stars in the </p>
<p>sky, that it is rst described and then oered a comparison so as to </p>
<p>make the description more poignant. e stars thus fell to earth in the </p>
<p>same way that gs drop from a g tree when shaken by a strong wind, </p>
<p>a description that assumes ripened gs that have not yet been harvest-</p>
<p>ed.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>With the sun blackened, the moon blood red, and the stars having</p>
<p>40. See Isa 29:6 and Ezek 38:19. e reader should be reminded that earthquakes </p>
<p>are especially unsettling, even in a scientic age where they are understood; how much </p>
<p>more so, therefore, in a pre-scientic age, when the most foundational reality of all, the </p>
<p>earth itself, rumbles and heaves.</p>
<p>41. One might compare this with Joel 2:31, whose imagery is slightly dierent </p>
<p>(“the sun will be turned to darkness”).</p>
<p>42. John is here again borrowing from the prophets, this time from Isa 34:4: “All </p>
<p>the stars in the sky will be dissolved, and the heavens rolled up like a scroll; all the </p>
<p>starry host will fall like withered leaves from the vine.”</p>
