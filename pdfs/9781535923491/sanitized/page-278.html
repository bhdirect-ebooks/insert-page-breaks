<p>Revelation 18:1—19:10</p>
<p>256</p>
<p>prophet and speaks directly to the city and the wealthy who have just </p>
<p>been described, saying to them, e fruit you longed for is gone from </p>
<p>you. If so, then “fruit”</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>in this case is not to be taken literally (aer all,</p>
<p>no fruit is mentioned in the list), but in the larger sense as referring </p>
<p>to all the things, edible and otherwise, that will no longer be available </p>
<p>when the city is brought to ruin. e sentence that follows seems to </p>
<p>make this suggestion a truly viable one, since the speaker, picking up </p>
<p>the abandoned harlot imagery from 17:16, goes on to bemoan for them </p>
<p>their great losses: All your luxury and splendor have vanished, never </p>
<p>to be recovered. is, aer all, is not the stu of sorrow over loss, but </p>
the words of the prophet himself, who speaks them with divine bold-
<p>ness directly to Rome itself. us he himself breaks into his own narra-</p>
<p>tive and announces what will be true for “the merchants of the earth.”</p>
<p>One should not hasten on at this point without noting how much </p>
<p>in keeping with the entire Old Testament prophetic tradition all of this </p>
<p>is. John’s point is singular: that the ill-gotten wealth of the city of Rome </p>
<p>represents a form of oppression that God has long judged as a corrupt-</p>
<p>ing inuence that turns people’s hearts away from the poor, and thus </p>
<p>away from God. e Jewish legal and prophetic traditions, to which </p>
<p>John and the early church were heirs, are singular at this point. Indeed, </p>
<p>John here sounds very much like Amos or Isaiah, both of whom regu-</p>
<p>larly plead the cause of the poor against the Israel that had forgotten the </p>
<p>heart of the Law, found among other places in Exodus 22:22–27:</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Do not take advantage of a widow or an orphan. </p>
<p>23</p>
<p>If you do </p>
<p>and they cry out to me, I will certainly hear their cry. </p>
<p>24</p>
<p>My anger </p>
<p>will be aroused, and I will kill you with the sword; your wives will </p>
<p>become widows and your children fatherless.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>If you lend money to one of my people among you who is </p>
<p>needy, do not be like a money-lender; charge no interest. </p>
<p>26</p>
<p>If you </p>
<p>take your neighbor’s cloak as a pledge, return it by sunset, </p>
<p>27</p>
<p>be-</p>
<p>cause that cloak is the only covering your neighbor has. What else </p>
<p>can your neighbor sleep in? When they cry out to me, I will hear, </p>
<p>for I am compassionate.</p>
<p>In light of this heritage Amos denounces the wealthy in Israel, who </p>
<p>“sell the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals; they </p>
<p>trample on the heads of the poor as upon the dust of the ground, and </p>
<p>17. e word for “fruit” in this case has to do with that grown on trees, which </p>
<p>ripens in late summer and early fall.</p>
