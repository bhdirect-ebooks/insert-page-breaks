<p>that take the form of what is merely creaturely, deities whose “image” </p>
<p>they believe can be found in the creature rather than in the Creator. </p>
<p>In the second passage the prophet oers an enlarged expression of the </p>
<p>same—the ultimate scathing caricature of those who would bow down </p>
<p>and worship what is nothing more that “the work of their own hands.” </p>
<p>Such people, the prophet concludes, “feed on ashes, a deluded heart </p>
<p>misleads them; they cannot save themselves” (44:20).</p>
<p>at denunciation and caricature are John’s ultimate intent is to be </p>
<p>found in the threefold description with which he concludes. First, quite </p>
<p>in keeping with Paul in 1 Corinthians 10:20, he rst describes the un-</p>
<p>repentant pagan world as worshiping demons. In so doing John is thus </p>
<p>reecting a view that can be found earlier in the Septuagint of Psalm </p>
<p>96:5 (LXX 95:5), where the translator turned the Hebrew “all the gods </p>
<p>of the nations are idols” into “all the gods of the nations are demons.” </p>
<p>is translation is an acknowledgement that the false gods did indeed </p>
<p>have power, but it is demonic/satanic power, not that of the living God. </p>
<p>en, in keeping with the entire biblical tradition, their objects of wor-</p>
<p>ship are further described with scathing satire; what they worship are </p>
<p>idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone and wood—idols that cannot see </p>
<p>or hear or walk. With this echo of Deuteronomy 4:28</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>John pretty well</p>
<p>sums it up from his Jewish, and now Christian, perspective. e “gods” </p>
<p>are created by human hands out of earthly materials, and as such they </p>
<p>are not living beings, but mere idols, characterized by their inability to </p>
<p>do what even mere human beings can do: “see . . . hear . . . walk,” thus </p>
<p>giving the briefest kind of expression to the traditional Jewish loathing </p>
<p>of idolatry.</p>
<p>But that is not all. What the Israelite prophets came to recognize </p>
<p>clearly is that people become like the “gods” they worship, a perspective </p>
<p>that is especially carried on by Paul and John in the New Testament. us </p>
<p>those who are being warned by the six preceding plagues continue in </p>
<p>their pagan ways, here summarized by three of the Ten Commandments </p>
<p>(their murders, . . . their sexual immorality or their thes), and in-</p>
<p>cluding their magic arts, an allusion to witchcra, which is also thor-</p>
<p>oughly denounced by the Prophets.</p>
