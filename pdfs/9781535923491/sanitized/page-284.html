<p>Revelation 18:1—19:10</p>
<p>262</p>
<p>could not be seen by a pilot with the sharpest of eyes. Nights without </p>
<p>lights mean a total loss of population; it means a Rome so devastated </p>
<p>that no one could possibly be living there. It means darkness will have </p>
<p>come to the most alive city in the Western world. All of which is brought </p>
<p>to its climax with the nal item, which also takes the reader back to the </p>
<p>loss of joy at the beginning: e voice of bridegroom and bride will </p>
<p>never be heard in you again, only now it also means the end of love </p>
<p>and family—the absolutely devastating end of any city.</p>
<p>e nal three lines of this poetry then spell out the ultimate rea-</p>
<p>sons for all of these losses: the fact that the merchants of Rome were </p>
<p>the world’s important people (!), but who used their (necessary) sig-</p>
<p>nicance as a magic spell by which they led astray all the nations. </p>
is would have been reason enough for divine judgment, but John’s
<p>concern rests ultimately with the nal word of judgment: In her was </p>
<p>found the blood of prophets and of God’s people (“saints”), that is, of </p>
<p>all who have been slaughtered on the earth. So once more John pres-</p>
<p>ents his readers with the theme of the martyrs, those who have been </p>
<p>killed by the Empire because they claimed another Lord than Caesar, </p>
<p>and refused so to acknowledge him—emperor, yes; but “Lord,” no.</p>
With these words, John concludes the series of woes, divine an-
<p>nouncements of doom on the three groups that allowed Rome to func-</p>
<p>tion at all as an empire: the “kings of the earth,” her merchants, and </p>
<p>the merchant marine. But for all of these, which in their own right in </p>
<p>the light of God’s former judgments on Babylon and Tyre are cause of </p>
divine judgment, the ultimate issue, and thus the one that will bring
<p>her down, is Rome’s own “slaughter of the innocents.” at part of the </p>
<p>story, however, must wait a while longer, because John’s own immediate </p>
<p>response picks up on the threefold woes that preceded, which turns out </p>
<p>to be both a heavenly response to the woes and an anticipation of the </p>
<p>rest of the story.</p>
<p>reefold Hallelujah over Babylon’s Fall (19:1–8)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Aer this I heard what sounded like the roar of a great multitude </p>
<p>in heaven shouting:</p>
<p>“Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,</p>
