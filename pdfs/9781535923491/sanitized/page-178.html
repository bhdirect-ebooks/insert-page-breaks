<p>they have to do with temporal judgments (that is, judgments within the </p>

<p>The Seventh Trumpet: Conclusion to the Introductory </p>
<p>Visions (11:15–19)</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>e seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud </p>
<p>voices in heaven, which said:</p>
<p>“e kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord </p>
<p>and of his Messiah,</p>
<p> and he will reign for ever and ever.”</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>And the twenty-four elders, who were seated on the thrones </p>
<p>before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God, </p>

<p>With the “passing” of the second woe (v. 14), and picking up where </p>
<p>the present narrative le o (9:21), John reports that the seventh angel </p>
<p>now blows his trumpet. Very much in keeping with the rst interlude </p>
<p>(7:9–17), the reader is returned to heaven to see what has been happen-</p>
<p>ing there during this time, since the view from above ultimately deter-</p>
<p>mines everything. e narrative is in three parts: in verse 15 John gives </p>
<p>the introductory scene, the sounding of the seventh trumpet; verses </p>
