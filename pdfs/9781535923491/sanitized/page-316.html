<p>Revelation 21:1–8</p>
<p>294</p>
<p>And now the eternal God himself speaks the “amen” to what the </p>
<p>heavenly voice has announced: I am making everything new! At the </p>
<p>heart of all this is the promised new creation, an eschatological real-</p>
<p>ization of what was intended in the original creation—before the fall, </p>
<p>and thus before human sin and selshness had pervaded everything. </p>
<p>Further to arm the certainty of this future for God’s people, God him-</p>
<p>self, who was seated on the throne, declares to John, Write this down, </p>
<p>for these words are trustworthy and true. To this is added, He [God] </p>
<p>said to me that the present story is now coming to an end—It is done, </p>
a declaration that is followed in turn by the words of divine armation
<p>that take us back to the beginning of the book (1:8): I am the Alpha </p>
<p>and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. Once again John reminds </p>
<p>his readers that the eternal God embraces all reality; there is absolutely </p>
nothing that lies outside his divine jurisdiction.
<p>e present emphasis, however, is not on God’s eternal nature, but </p>
<p>on his compassionate relationship with those who belong to him. us </p>
<p>words are spoken rst to the thirsty (v. 6), and only then to those who </p>
<p>are victorious (v. 7). To former, God promises, I will give water from </p>
<p>the spring of the water of life, rich imagery that reminds John’s readers </p>
<p>not only that the best drinking water comes from a “spring,” but also </p>
that this is the ultimate divine spring, gushing forth with life-giving,
<p>life-sustaining water. To “the victorious” is promised an eternal familial </p>
<p>relationship with God, which means that they will inherit all this, pre-</p>
<p>sumably “the Holy City” with its tearless and deathless existence. Not </p>
<p>only so, but God further promises that I will be their God and they will </p>
<p>be my children, language one easily recognizes as that of the Fourth </p>
<p>Gospel, where Jesus repeatedly refers to God as his “Father,” who at the </p>
<p>end is called “my Father” and thus also “your Father” (John 20:17).</p>
<p>us the future for God’s “children” is rich, and beyond anything </p>
<p>human beings have experienced to this point in time: a “new Jerusalem” </p>
<p>where God dwells with his people, where sorrow is done forever, where </p>
<p>the thirsty drink from an eternal spring owing with the water of life, </p>
<p>and where God’s people live forever with their heavenly Father as his </p>
<p>children. But in the same fashion as John will do again regarding the </p>
<p>beatitude in the epilogue (22:14–15),</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>all of this is made the more potent</p>
<p>by way of a stark contrast with those who fall short of this bliss, which </p>
<p>5. “Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree </p>
<p>of life and may go through the gates into the city.”</p>
