<p>e Seven Bowls Are Poured Out</p>
<p>221</p>
<p>e Fih and Sixth Bowls plus the Interlude (16:10–16)</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>e h angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, </p>
<p>and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their </p>
<p>tongues in agony </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>and cursed the God of heaven because of their </p>
<p>pains and their sores, but they refused to repent of what they had </p>
<p>done.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>e sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river </p>
<p>Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the </p>
<p>kings from the East. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>en I saw three impure spirits that looked </p>
<p>like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the </p>
<p>mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet. </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>ey are demonic spirits that perform signs, and they go out to </p>
<p>the kings of the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the </p>
<p>great day of God Almighty.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>“Look, I come like a thief! Blessed are those who stay awake </p>
<p>and keep their clothes on, so that they may not go naked</p>
<p>and be shamefully exposed.”</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>en they gathered the kings together to the place that in </p>
<p>Hebrew is called Armageddon.</p>
<p>As one might well expect at this point in the narrative, the content </p>
<p>of the h bowl, poured out by the h angel, is directed explicitly </p>
<p>against the Empire itself, thus on the throne of the beast. en in a </p>
<p>moment of splendid irony, the beast’s kingdom was plunged into </p>
<p>darkness, echoing the ninth plague. Although one cannot be certain </p>
<p>here, the beast’s “kingdom” is now most likely narrowed to Rome itself. </p>
<p>us the assumed subject of the nal clause, which the NIV renders as </p>
<p>people, should probably be thought of not in general terms, but in this </p>
<p>specically as the beast and his followers, that is, the Empire and all </p>
<p>those most closely associated with it and its policies. What is perhaps </p>
<p>most striking about their response is that “people” both gnawed their </p>
<p>tongues in agony and then used their tongues, not in this case to “curse </p>
<p>the name of God,” but to curse the God of heaven because of their </p>
<p>pains and sores. us in typical fashion the unbelieving world refuses </p>
<p>to acknowledge God when things go well for them, but when things go </p>
<p>badly, God is to blame. And the result tends regularly to be the same—</p>
<p>they refused to repent of what they had done. Indeed, one need only </p>
<p>consider that in our modern English-speaking world, natural disasters </p>
<p>are regularly referred to as “acts of God”! And as with ancient Rome, </p>
