themselves divine; for when the redeemed cry out their acclamation,
<p>“salvation belongs to . . . God . . . and the Lamb,” the angelic host itself </p>
<p>fell down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God. ey </p>
<p>begin with the Amen! armed at the end of the former scene by the </p>
<p>four living creatures—and repeated at the end of the present list. eir </p>
<p>praise in turn echoes the singing found in both chapters 4 and 5. us:</p>
<p>4:11 5:12 5:14 7:12</p>
<p>glory power praise praise</p>
<p>honor wealth honor glory</p>
<p>power wisdom glory wisdom</p>
<p>strength power thanks</p>
<p>honor honor</p>
<p>glory power</p>
<p>praise strength</p>
<p>As noted previously regarding these lists, they are representative, </p>
<p>and thus no one of them is either consistent with the others or com-</p>
<p>plete in itself. e singular addition found in this list and in none of </p>
<p>the others is thanks, a most interesting addition here, since it is put </p>
<p>in the mouths of angels rather than of those who themselves owe such </p>
<p>thanksgiving to God for their redemption. As elsewhere, the acclama-</p>
<p>tion represented by these seven words is simply assumed as that which </p>
<p>rightfully belongs to God.</p>
<p>What follows is typical of the Apocalypse in that John regularly </p>
<p>moves toward his explanations by means of a question. Of high interest </p>
<p>in this case is the fact that the question is not by John himself—although </p>
<p>this is the obvious concern—rather he now gets there by having one of </p>
<p>the elders ask John the question. Having identied them as heavenly </p>
<p>victors (ese in white robes), the question addressed to John is two-</p>
<p>fold: who are they, and where did they come from? To which John </p>
<p>responds, Sir, you know.</p>
<p>e answer John receives is likewise twofold. First, ese are </p>
<p>they who have come out of the great tribulation. is latter word is a </p>
<p>most unfortunate—and quite unnecessary—carryover from preceding </p>
<p>English translations, since it was co-opted over a century ago by some </p>
<p>interpreters to refer to a specic time period. But time is of no inter-</p>
