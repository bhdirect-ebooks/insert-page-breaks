<p>Rome as a Seductive Harlot</p>
<p>237</p>
<p>“names written in the book of life” from the creation of the world. is </p>
<p>language, of course, has little to do with the later Christian doctrine of </p>
<p>election, and everything to do with that of “the security of the believer.” </p>
<p>at is, John is here strengthening the resolve of his readers/hearers by </p>
<p>reminding them of the eternal nature of their calling, from eternity to </p>
<p>eternity, as it were.</p>
<p>Further Interpretation of the Beast (17:9–11)</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>“is calls for a mind with wisdom. e seven heads are seven </p>
<p>hills on which the woman sits. </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>ey are also seven kings. Five </p>
<p>have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; but when he does </p>
<p>come, he must remain for only a little while. </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>e beast who once </p>
<p>was, and now is not, is an eighth king. He belongs to the seven and </p>
<p>is going to his destruction.</p>
<p>John now speaks directly to his readers, telling them that the preced-</p>
<p>ing imagery calls for a mind with wisdom, which at the same time </p>
<p>reminds us later readers how much there is that is not available to us. </p>
<p>“Wisdom” in this case does not point to wisdom in general, but calls </p>
<p>for John’s original readers to recognize what he intended by the preced-</p>
<p>ing imagery; even so, only a person with no knowledge of the ancient </p>
<p>world could miss the imagery. us John’s “call” here is more a way of </p>
<p>introducing what follows than it is a heads-up, although it very likely </p>
<p>functions in both ways. Most of all it calls for “a mind with wisdom” be-</p>
<p>cause John himself is about to launch one of the more dicult moments </p>
<p>in his book, where he oers two identications of the seven heads and </p>
<p>still another identication of the beast.</p>
<p>e rst thing up is the one that anyone who has taken a course </p>
<p>in ancient history will immediately recognize as the best known char-</p>
<p>acteristic of Rome; thus the seven heads are the seven hills on which </p>
<p>the woman sits. But what comes next is especially puzzling (intrigu-</p>
<p>ing?), and is the primary factor in an earlier dating of the book by many </p>
<p>scholars, namely, that “the seven heads” are also seven kings. At issue </p>
<p>is whether one counts the actual number of emperors, including the </p>
<p>infamous Gaius Caligula (37–41 CE), and also whether the quick suc-</p>
<p>cession of four “emperors” in 68–69 CE is to be counted as one. Were </p>
<p>John’s numbers followed precisely, in terms of what is actually known of </p>
<p>Roman history, then the ve who have fallen would take one through </p>
