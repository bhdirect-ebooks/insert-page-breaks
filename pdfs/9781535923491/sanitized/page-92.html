<p>Revelation 4:1–6a</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>rest of the book their activities border on those of the angels. In both 5:5 </p>
<p>and 7:13–14 one of them speaks to John, and elsewhere they are part of </p>
<p>the heavenly worship of God (5:11; 11:16; 14:3; 19:4). But rather than </p>
<p>try to resolve this complex use of images, one must remember that in </p>
<p>the apocalyptic genre such things can happen regularly, and without </p>
<p>need of a “resolution,” as it were. In any case, the diculties tend to be </p>
<p>of our own making, related to our wont to resolve things in some kind </p>
<p>of ordinary time frame as such. e apocalyptic genre allows for a more </p>
<p>uid use of images.</p>
<p>Since throughout the rest of the book the elders’ primary activity </p>
<p>is worship, the heavenly picture would not be complete without their </p>
<p>joining in the present scene of worship as well, in anticipation of their </p>
<p>being raised from the dead. is seems to be especially so in light of </p>
<p>the further description of them as “dressed in white,” with “crowns of </p>
<p>gold on their heads.” In any case, John is regularly forced to deal simul-</p>
<p>taneously with both temporal and eternal realities, which causes some </p>
<p>considerable diculty in putting it all in straightforward chronological </p>
<p>order. is becomes especially noticeable in 5:8–14, where the heavenly </p>
<p>worshipers are nally expanded to include every creature in heaven and </p>
<p>earth and under the earth, and in 7:9–17, where the followers of the </p>
<p>Lamb are pictured as already in heaven. us John is seldom dealing </p>
<p>with chronology as such, but with eternal verities.</p>
is initial description of the divine splendor then moves from
<p>what encircled the throne to what proceeded from the throne, namely </p>
<p>ashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder. is language is </p>
<p>taken directly from the theophany in Exodus 19:16–19, which all Israel </p>
<p>experienced at the base of Mount Sinai. is echo thus provides John </p>
<p>once more with a picture that ties the two covenants together, as he has </p>
<p>a glimpse into the future of the people of God from both covenants.</p>
<p>Finally, John’s vision of heaven includes two realities that are de-</p>
<p>scribed as in front of the throne (vv. 5b and 6a). First, and the Spirit’s </p>
<p>only appearance in heaven in this book,</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>John saw seven lamps . . .</p>
<p>blazing, which are then interpreted with the language of 1:4 in terms </p>
<p>of the seven spirits of God. As before, this is rightly understood as </p>
<p>“the sevenfold Spirit,” imagery taken from Isaiah 11:2, where it said the </p>
<p>5. e reason for this, of course, is that in the entire NT understanding of things, </p>
<p>the Spirit is on earth to continue the work of Christ in the life of the believer and in </p>
<p>the church as a body.</p>
