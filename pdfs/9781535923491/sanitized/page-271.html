<p>e Fall of Babylon the Great</p>
<p>249</p>
<p>where what she is to receive is expressed in terms of Rome’s own arro-</p>
<p>gance: the glory and luxury she gave herself. One should not one read </p>
<p>over that line too quickly. For on the one hand John is striking directly </p>
<p>at everything the Empire thought about itself, its own “glory” as the </p>
<p>greatest of all empires; on the other hand, he is equally incensed about </p>
<p>the self-indulgent “luxury” that her powerful and beautiful people had </p>
<p>given themselves. us, John’s call here is for the forces that will bring </p>
<p>Rome to ruin to get on with their task.</p>
<p>As a nal touch to this description of Rome’s present decadence, a </p>
decadence that calls for divine judgment, John echoes portions of Isaiah
<p>47:7–8. Here in one of the more remarkable of all such Old Testament </p>
<p>oracles against a foreign power, Isaiah announces that “Virgin Daughter </p>
<p>Babylon” will “sit in the dust . . . on the ground without a throne.” John </p>
<p>now applies this to Rome, for, as Babylon before her, what she boasts </p>
<p>in her heart is twofold. First, she boasts in her present glory (I sit en-</p>
<p>throned as queen), which from a merely worldly perspective was as </p>
<p>true of Rome as it had been true formerly of Babylon. Indeed, it is dif-</p>
<p>cult for the reader from our distance to appreciate how bold such a </p>
<p>prophecy was for this Christian prophet who was in exile on Patmos </p>
<p>in part because he himself had refused to “bow down to the queen.” At </p>
<p>the same time, second, she boasts that I will never be a widow (Isaiah </p>
<p>47:8), meaning both that Rome expected never to be abandoned by her </p>
<p>various paramours and that she expected never to be in the same help-</p>
<p>less position as a widow during the Greco-Roman period.</p>
e divine response to such arrogance takes the form of two kinds
<p>of judgments, wherein John is still echoing the prophecy in Isaiah 47, </p>
<p>now from verse 9.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>First, in one day her plagues will overtake her,</p>
<p>which in John’s Greek almost certainly means, “the plagues that she has </p>
<p>coming to her will overtake her.” But in contrast to the widowhood and </p>
<p>childlessness of the Isaiah oracle, John’s version of the “plagues” aban-</p>
<p>dons that imagery for a straightforward listing of human ills, which </p>
<p>takes the interesting order of death, mourning and famine. us the </p>
<p>“death” of many will lead to much “mourning,” which is followed in </p>
<p>turn by “famine,” apparently because so many who provided food will </p>
<p>be dead. Second, the city itself will be consumed by re, imagery that </p>
<p>will be picked up again in 19:3 as an accomplished reality (“the smoke </p>
<p>12. e Isaiah oracle reads, “Both of these will overtake you in a moment, on a </p>
<p>single day: loss of children and widowhood.”</p>
