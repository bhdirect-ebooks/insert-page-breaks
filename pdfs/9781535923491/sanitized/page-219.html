<p>beast in the preceding narrative. us the angel begins with the condi-</p>
<p>tion that if anyone worships the beast [13:4, 8] and its image [13:14] </p>
<p>and receives its mark on the forehead or on the hand (13:16–17); but </p>
<p>now, rather than their being able to buy and sell by so doing, instead </p>
<p>they, too, will drink the wine of God’s fury, which is then further </p>
<p>described with language from Isaiah 51:7 as having been poured full </p>
<p>strength into the cup of his wrath. In so doing John thus picks up the </p>
<p>promised judgment announced in the sixth seal in 6:16 (cf. 11:18).</p>
<p>is “full strength” of “God’s fury,” despite the diculty many </p>
<p>modern readers have with it, is then described in a way that is quite in </p>
<p>keeping with both the overall perspective of this book as well as with </p>
<p>the biblical lex talionis (law of just retribution, “an eye for an eye”). </p>
<p>In common parlance, it means that one gets back what one gives out. </p>
<p>erefore, as is common to all human history, just as people become </p>
like the “god/s” they worship, so in the divine order of things those who
<p>worship the emperor and thus delight in his armies will receive in kind </p>
<p>what they delight in. So John, again echoing language from the Old </p>
<p>Testament and anticipating the judgment of Satan in 20:7–10, envisions </p>
<p>that they will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of </p>
<p>the holy angels and the Lamb. Indeed, the smoke of their torment </p>
<p>will rise for ever and ever (cf. Isa 34:10), whose eternal nature is then </p>
<p>further emphasized in that there will be no rest day or night for those </p>
<p>who worship the beast and its image, or for anyone who receives the </p>
<p>mark of its name. To take this imagery literally is simply to miss the </p>
<p>point, especially if one is required to look upon the Divine “presence” </p>
<p>as a place, which also has a pit for burning sulfur. What it does suggest is </p>
<p>that their punishment is timeless; but where “time is no more,” those of </p>
<p>us who are by the very nature of things time-bound cannot even imag-</p>
<p>ine our way into such timelessness, and therefore into its eternal nature. </p>
<p>As part of the human race, John was giving expression in the only kind </p>
<p>of language available to him (and us) the horror of eternal separation </p>
<p>from the God in whose image all have been created, and through Christ </p>
<p>and the Spirit are being re-created. Such “eternal separation” lies be-</p>
<p>yond all attempts to imagine, whether it be John’s Revelation or Dante’s </p>
<p>Inferno. One must simply hear this for the horror it represents: to be </p>
<p>aware of the reality of “the holy angels and the Lamb,” but miss out on </p>
<p>being there.</p>
