<p>RE V ELATION 12:1—14 :13</p>
<p>The Holy War Is Engaged</p>
<p>In turning to chapters 12–14 in the Revelation, one comes to the theo-</p>
<p>logical center of things. Indeed, here is the clear evidence that John’s in-</p>
<p>terest lies not with chronology as such; rather he is oering a prophetic/</p>
<p>theological word of warning and encouragement to God’s people at the </p>
<p>turn of the rst century because of what is about to happen to them. </p>
<p>Here the interest is not at all with the question of when, but with the </p>
<p>what, who, and why of the coming events. e what, one is not sur-</p>
<p>prised to learn, is the coming Holy War, but now placed in its ultimate </p>
<p>theological perspective. e who also oers no surprises; they are the </p>
<p>forces of evil, now expressed in the form of an unholy “trinity” of Satan </p>
<p>and his two beasts, one from the sea, the other from the land. ese </p>
<p>evil forces are seen as arrayed against the people of God, the follow-</p>
<p>ers of the Lamb. e why follows closely behind; God’s people are the </p>
<p>earthly representatives of Satan’s defeat by the Lamb—in his cross and </p>
<p>resurrection—people who will neither worship Satan nor the beast(s) </p>
<p>nor join in the great city’s sins. us they stand as constant reminders to </p>
<p>the Empire that not all people in their broad domain are ready to bow </p>
<p>to Caesar, as though he were a god.</p>
<p>What is described in these three pictures lies at the heart of every-</p>
<p>thing for John. Here the reader receives explanations of moments that </p>
<p>up to now have been mentioned only in passing. is passage returns </p>
<p>the reader to the rst six seals in chapter 6, where in turn John spelled </p>
<p>out the enmity of the Empire against God’s people (seals 1–4), with the </p>
<p>resultant martyrdoms (seal 5) and anticipation of the nal judgment </p>
<p>(seal 6). e story that is told here concentrates on the causes and re-</p>
<p>sults of the Holy War. us in chapter 12 John oers the ultimate theo-</p>
<p>logical basis/explanation for everything that is about to happen to these </p>
<p>early believers. Satan’s defeat in the heavenly realm by the crucied but </p>
<p>now risen Lamb eventuates in his waging relentless war against those </p>
