<p>e Unopened Scroll</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>scenes together. But now a further, and especially signicant, dimen-</p>
<p>sion is added to the scene: in</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>God’s right hand there is a scroll with</p>
<p>writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals. e purpose and </p>
<p>signicance of this highly unusual feature, writing on both sides, is </p>
<p>never forthcoming in the narrative itself. And whereas it may simply be </p>
<p>an attention-getting device, intended to concentrate the reader’s aware-</p>
<p>ness onto its importance in the narrative that follows, John himself is </p>
<p>here indebted to the imagery of Ezekiel 2:9–10: “en I looked, and I </p>
<p>saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll. . . . On both sides of it </p>
<p>were written words of lament and mourning and woe.”</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Although the</p>
<p>scroll itself with its seven seals will be the main focus of the narrative </p>
<p>that follows (chs. 6–8), John’s immediate interest is to introduce the </p>
<p>Lamb, the only one found worthy to open the scroll.</p>
<p>e next feature of the narrative then adds to its dramatic nature, </p>
<p>as a mighty angel cries out. But those who visualize as they read are </p>
<p>also now le a bit in the dark, especially with regard to “a mighty angel,” </p>
<p>since this language ordinarily refers to strength; however, one has the </p>
<p>sense that John here intended something more in the order of “majes-</p>
<p>tic,” thus an angel who was stunning or glorious in appearance. is </p>
<p>angel then sets the wheels in motion for what follows by proclaiming </p>
<p>in a loud voice. Such a description is especially tting, since this angel </p>
<p>with his mighty voice is setting the reader up for the introduction of </p>
<p>Christ himself.</p>
<p>Before that, however, and still heightening the drama, John tells his </p>
<p>readers that no one in heaven and on earth or under the earth could </p>
<p>open the scroll. ese nal words “open the scroll”, repeated no less </p>
<p>than four times in this presenting paragraph (including v. 5), become </p>
<p>the primary issue in the narrative that follows. us, expressed in the </p>
<p>cosmology of antiquity, with earth as the center point for those dwelling </p>
<p>on it, John notes that not a single known creature, human or angelic or </p>
<p>demonic, had either the authority or ability to break the seven seals and </p>
<p>thus to “open the scroll” so as to see what was written on it. Indeed, John </p>
<p>puts this lack of authority in the strongest kind of language, since what </p>
<p>the NIV (almost certainly correctly) has rendered even look inside it </p>
<p>11. e Greek preposition here is epi (“on”), thus implying an open hand with the </p>
<p>scroll “on” it, although the English idiom would still be “in it.”</p>
<p>12. At the same time this imagery probably also contains an allusion to Dan 12:4, </p>
<p>where Daniel was told to seal up his scroll until the end of time.</p>
