<p>e rone in Heaven</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>Messiah will experience “the Spirit of the Lord” resting on him, who is </p>
<p>then described with six Spirit-endowed qualities (“the Spirit of wisdom </p>
<p>and understanding,” etc.). e second reality situated in front of the </p>
<p>throne was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. is imag-</p>
<p>ery, though not the language itself, is derived directly from Ezekiel 1:22, </p>
<p>and traditionally has been called “an expanse,” but which the NIV has </p>
<p>rendered (probably more correctly) as “a vault” that was “sparkling like </p>
<p>crystal.” Whether intentional on John’s part or not, one should note that </p>
<p>the sea is usually negative imagery in Scripture, as a place that is wild </p>
<p>and untamed. But here it has clearly been tamed, appearing like “glass, </p>
<p>clear as crystal.”</p>
<p>All together this series of images is intended to inspire awe and </p>
<p>wonder on the part of the reader, who is being brought into the pres-</p>
<p>ence of God, and before whom only awe and worship are the worthy </p>
<p>responses; and that is what John now goes on to describe.</p>
<p>The Occupants of Heaven and Their Worship (4:6b–11)</p>
<p>6b</p>
<p>In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, and </p>
<p>they were covered with eyes, in front and in back. </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>e rst living </p>
<p>creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a </p>
<p>face like a human being, the fourth was like a ying eagle. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Each </p>
<p>of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with </p>
<p>eyes all around, even under his wings. Day and night they never </p>
<p>stop saying:</p>
<p>“‘Holy, holy, holy</p>
<p>is the Lord God Almighty,’</p>
<p>who was, and is, and is to come.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to </p>
<p>him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever, </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>the </p>
<p>twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, </p>
<p>and worship him who lives for ever and ever. ey lay their crowns </p>
<p>before the throne and say:</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>“You are worthy, our Lord and God,</p>
<p>to receive glory and honor and power,</p>
<p>for you created all things,</p>
<p>and by your will they were created</p>
<p>and have their being.”</p>
