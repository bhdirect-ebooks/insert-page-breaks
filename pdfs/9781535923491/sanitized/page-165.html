<p>Interlude 1: e Angel and the Little Scroll</p>
<p>143</p>
<p>at the little scroll functions as drama only, and its content is thus </p>
<p>irrelevant to the present scene, becomes clear in the succeeding para-</p>
<p>graph (vv. 5–7), where John, by way of description alone, intensies the </p>
<p>drama. He begins by picking up the description of the angel from verse </p>
<p>1, namely, the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land. </p>
<p>But now by the angel’s raising his right hand to heaven, the traditional </p>
<p>hand for taking an oath, he swore on the authority of the eternal God </p>
<p>that “there will be no more delay!” e awesome nature of the oath is </p>
<p>emphasized by John’s elaboration of the God in whose name the angel </p>
<p>has sworn. e emphasis lies simultaneously on the fact that this is the </p>
<p>eternal God (him who lives for ever and ever) and that this God alone </p>
<p>is Creator of everything else that exists in the universe, as that is known </p>
<p>by the rst-century reader. us with a clear echo of Exodus 20:11,</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> </p>
<p>the angel swears by the Living God, the one who created the heavens </p>
<p>and all that is in them, the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and </p>
<p>all that is in it.</p>
<p>e point of all this, intentionally linked to the little scroll, is what </p>
<p>the angel swears at the end of our verse 6: ere will be no more delay!</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, this is then qualied by a temporal referent: in the days when </p>
<p>the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet. In itself this referent </p>
<p>does not suggest that it will be soon, although it is very likely that John </p>
<p>expected this moment to be in his near future. Indeed, John keeps the </p>
<p>ambiguity alive by speaking of this eschatological event in terms of the </p>
<p>mystery of God that will be accomplished before the nal moment </p>
<p>occurs. e nal clause is also full of ambiguity for the later reader. </p>
<p>Does just as he announced to his servants the prophets refer to the </p>
<p>prophets of Israel, whose oracles are written for posterity in the Old </p>
<p>Testament? Or, more likely it would seem, is this an application of an </p>
<p>Old Testament prophetic announcement</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>to some Christian prophets</p>
<p>of his own day, of whom he is one himself, as the nal sentence in the </p>
<p>23. Which reads, “For in six days the LORD made the heavens, the earth, the sea, </p>
<p>and all that is in them.”</p>
<p>24. is is almost certainly the intent of John’s own idiom, which the KJV transla-</p>
<p>tors rendered more literally as “and time shall be no more,” an idiom that made its way </p>
<p>into one of the eschatological gospel songs from my childhood: “When the trumpet </p>
<p>of the Lord shall sound, and time shall be no more” (“When the Roll Is Called Up </p>
<p>Yonder,” James M. Black, 1893).</p>
<p>25. See esp. Amos 3:7: “Surely the Sovereign LORD does nothing without reveal-</p>
<p>ing his plan to his servants the prophets.”</p>
