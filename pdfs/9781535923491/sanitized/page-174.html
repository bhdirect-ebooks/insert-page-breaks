<p>Revelation 11:1–14</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>e image of “the beast” in this case rst of all echoes this familiar </p>
<p>theme from Daniel 7, where the nal beast that “came up out of the </p>
<p>sea” is pictured as “devouring his victims” and “trampling under foot </p>
<p>whatever was le” (v. 19), who then in verse 21 is seen as “waging war </p>
<p>against the saints.” But at the end (v. 27) the “sovereignty, power and </p>
<p>greatness of the kingdoms . . . will be handed over to the saints of the </p>
<p>Most High.” At the same time John is here anticipating the elabora-</p>
<p>tion of this moment, which will be the major content of chapter 13. </p>
<p>At this point in the narrative John pictures their martyrdoms in terms </p>
<p>of their bodies lying in the public square of the great city—which is </p>
<p>guratively called Sodom and Egypt. us, with imagery that he can </p>
<p>get away with, since John can be sure that the Roman Empire will know </p>
<p>nothing of the biblical narrative, he likens Rome to both Sodom, the </p>
<p>city of unparalleled vice in the Abraham narrative of Genesis 18–19, </p>
<p>and Egypt, the ultimate biblical expression of enmity against God’s </p>
<p>people and of pagan degradation. At the same time he is most likely </p>
<p>following the precedent of Isaiah, who speaks of the unfaithful leaders </p>
<p>of Israel as “you rulers of Sodom” (1:10). It is also highly likely that </p>
<p>John is here reecting back on the Neronic persecutions, where scores </p>
<p>of believers lost their lives—in the “public square,” as it were—as they </p>
<p>were covered with tarred animal skins and set aame to serve as light </p>
<p>for Nero’s infamous garden parties.</p>
<p>However, the second way of identifying “the great city” creates a </p>
<p>moment of dissonance for many readers, since John speaks of Rome as </p>
<p>the city where also their Lord was crucied. is phrase, together with </p>
<p>the imagery of the temple in verses 1 and 2, has caused some interpret-</p>
<p>ers, understandably so, to see the referent as Jerusalem. But everything </p>
<p>else in the narrative indicates that “the great city” is Rome itself. Indeed, </p>
<p>John’s own readers would be quick to see this as a referent to Rome, </p>
<p>since crucixion (mentioned here alone in this book) was a singularly </p>
<p>Roman form of execution. e fact that “the great city” is now likened </p>
<p>to Sodom, the mother of all sexual perversity, and Egypt, the oppressors </p>
<p>of God’s people, taken with the rest of the imagery in the book, seems </p>
<p>to be conclusive that this imagery points to Rome. And it is imagery </p>
<p>John can get away with, since the “inhabitants of the earth” referred to </p>
<p>in verse 10, who consider Rome to be the center of their universe, will </p>
<p>scarcely recognize the biblical referents.</p>
