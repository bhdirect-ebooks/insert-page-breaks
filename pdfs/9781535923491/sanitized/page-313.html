<p>Introduction: A New Heaven and a New Earth</p>
<p>291</p>
<p>John begins by reciting the prophetic promise in Isaiah 65:17: I </p>
<p>saw a new heaven and a new earth, now made necessary because the </p>
<p>rst [present] heaven and rst [present] earth had “ed” from God’s </p>
<p>presence (20:11), and therefore had passed away. Moreover, and of </p>
<p>special meaning to the ancients, for whom the sea was foreboding, John </p>
<p>adds that there was no longer any sea, even though the God of heaven </p>
<p>had made the sea (14:7). e sea is thus eliminated both because of its </p>
<p>associations with evil and (especially) because it is no longer necessary </p>
<p>in the new order.</p>
<p>What John saw next is a wonderful collocation of images, which </p>
<p>was surely designed to excite the imagination of the hearers. ere are </p>
<p>four of them altogether. First up, with language taken from Isaiah 52:1, </p>
<p>John saw the Holy City, which in turn becomes both a people and a </p>
<p>place. is descriptive name is then followed by its actual name, the </p>
<p>new Jerusalem. Even though “new Jerusalem” is not the language of the </p>
<p>Old Testament as such, it is implied in such passages as Isaiah 65:18 (“I </p>
<p>will create Jerusalem to be a delight”). It is “new,” of course, because it is </p>
<p>to be placed on the “new earth.” en, given that cities from antiquity to </p>
<p>the present are referred to in the feminine gender, the “new Jerusalem” </p>
<p>is further described as prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her </p>
<p>husband. is imagery can only refer to the church, which was pre-</p>
<p>viously identied as “the bride of the Lamb” (19:7), whose “wedding </p>
<p>dress” of ne linen “stood for the righteous acts of God’s people.”</p>
<p>Two matters regarding this imagery call for further notice. First, the </p>
<p>language itself is derived from Isaiah 61:10, where renewed Jerusalem </p>
<p>itself speaks:</p>
<p>I delight greatly in the Lord;</p>
<p> my soul rejoices in my God.</p>
<p>For he has clothed me with garments of salvation</p>
<p> and arrayed me in a robe of righteousness</p>
<p>as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest,</p>
<p> and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.</p>
<p>By so doing, of course, John deliberately presents “the Holy City” as </p>
<p>a bride in stark contrast to “the great city” that was called a harlot in </p>
<p>chapter 17, Rome itself.</p>
<p>Second, and now to pick up what was not discussed above, the “new </p>
<p>Jerusalem” is viewed as coming down out of heaven from God (which </p>
<p>will be repeated in verse 10). Two matters are of particular signicance </p>
