<p>Revelation 2:12–17</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>its very strong implications, that Christ intends to purify his church </p>
<p>and will personally do battle against those who would pervert his pure </p>
<p>gospel into something else.</p>
<p>Following the call to hear what the Spirit says to the churches, </p>
<p>which is common to each of the letters, in this instance the promise to </p>
<p>those who are victorious (note again the battle imagery) is full of mys-</p>
<p>tery for later readers. First, the promise is that I will give them some </p>
<p>of the hidden manna. e allusion to manna is clear enough—having </p>
to do with divine provision for God’s pilgrim people—but what was
<p>intended by calling it “hidden” is simply not known to us, although it </p>
<p>has opened the door to all manner of speculation! e implication is </p>
most likely eschatological; that is, it is a metaphor for the divine provi-
<p>sion that awaits all those who are Christ’s. As with the long discourse in </p>
<p>John 6, and looking toward the future, this imagery seems intended to </p>
<p>point to the nal great eschatological feast provided for God’s redeemed </p>
<p>people, later called the “marriage supper of the lamb” (Rev 19:6–9). It </p>
<p>almost certainly is intended also to stand in stark contrast to meals </p>
<p>eaten in the pagan temples in honor of false gods.</p>
<p>Second, the promise is that I will also give each of them a white </p>
<p>stone. is curious clause is most likely intended to be multivalent </p>
<p>imagery, since there are at least three known possibilities from the </p>
<p>ancient world that may lie behind it. Its rst referent is most likely to </p>
<p>the description of the manna in Exodus 16:31, where we learn that “it </p>
<p>was white like coriander seed.” is seems to be the most likely rst </p>
<p>referent in the present case. But if one couples this reference with two </p>
<p>other data from the period then this language can be shown to make a </p>
<p>great deal of sense. On the one hand, there is good evidence that jury </p>
<p>verdicts from this period produced a black stone if the accused was </p>
<p>found guilty, but a white stone if acquitted. At the same time, on the </p>
<p>other hand, there is some evidence that white stones were used to gain </p>
<p>admission to public festivals. If one were to combine this evidence, then </p>
<p>the “hidden manna” they are to receive at the Eschaton, vis-à-vis their </p>
<p>refusal to participate in the local pagan festivals, represents their form </p>
<p>of admission to the nal festive meal that believers are to experience at </p>
<p>the “marriage supper of the Lamb.”</p>
<p>In any case, these promises are all to be understood as eschatologi-</p>
cal, and the new name written on each individual white stone, which
<p>is known only to the one who receives it, seems to anticipate the fur-</p>
