<p>e Lamb Takes the Scroll and Heaven Rejoices</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>redemption of all peoples as its goal. eir song begins by acclaiming </p>
<p>the means of his redeeming act, with your blood, thus intentionally </p>
<p>using language from the Old Testament sacricial system to heighten </p>
<p>its aect. e song then proclaims the eect of that act, you purchased </p>
<p>for God, now echoing language from Psalm 74:2, where the psalmist </p>
<p>reminds God, as it were, that he had “purchased” Israel to be his own </p>
<p>people. It then concludes with the breadth of the Lamb’s redemption, </p>
<p>members of every tribe and language and people and nation.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>With</p>
<p>these words the Abrahamic covenant, with its inclusion of the Gentiles, </p>
<p>is given a liturgical setting. In so doing John is arming one of the </p>
<p>frequent themes in the eschatological outlook of the Prophets—as well </p>
<p>as the major passion in the ministry of Paul—that God chose Israel so </p>
<p>that through them he might bless the whole world. us both the ef-</p>
<p>fect and the breadth of Christ’s redeeming work are extolled in the rst </p>
<p>stanza of this hymn.</p>
<p>e second stanza of the hymn then proclaims the goal of Christ’s </p>
<p>redemptive act. e people Christ has redeemed with his blood have </p>
<p>been made . . . to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, a clear </p>
<p>echo of John’s opening doxology in 1:5b–6; but now he adds that they </p>
<p>will reign on the earth. Ordinarily priests make for very bad kings, and </p>
vice versa, since both human and “divine” power are in their hands. But
<p>this is a scene that is looking forward to the nal, and thus eternal, re-</p>
<p>demption of God’s people. In doing so it thereby anticipates the restored </p>
<p>Eden of 22:1–5, which concludes, “and they will reign for ever and ever.” </p>
<p>us in the “new song” everyone celebrates the Lamb’s redemption, and </p>
<p>what that means for his people—and this should especially be read with </p>
<p>the preceding 1:9—3:22 in view.</p>
<p>But that is not everything; this is heaven, aer all. So John adds, </p>
<p>then I looked, not so much to see as to hear the voice of many angels, </p>
<p>24. It is of some interest that the listing of peoples in this passage (“tribe”/“language”/ </p>
<p>“people”/“nation”) occurs 6 more times in the Revelation (7:9; 10:11; 11:9; 13:7; 14:6; </p>
<p>17:15), with the same 4 words in all but 10:11 (“kingdoms” instead of “tribe”) and 17:5 </p>
<p>(“multitudes” instead of “tribes”), and sometimes plural instead of singular, but no two </p>
<p>are in the same word order. Below is the list of terms in order for each passage.</p>
<p>5:9 7:9 10:11 11:9 13:7 14:6 17:15</p>
