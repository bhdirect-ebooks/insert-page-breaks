<p>To the Church in Ephesus</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>enough to understand in terms of its meaning as such (the love you had </p>
<p>at rst), but is less so in terms of the object of their love. Was John re-</p>
<p>ferring to their love for Christ, or for one another and others? Although </p>
the scholarly house is rather evenly divided on this matter, one wonders
<p>whether John was not purposefully ambiguous, considering that in his </p>
<p>understanding of things (in the Gospel and First John) love for Christ </p>
<p>and love for his people are so closely interrelated. Although there are no </p>
<p>specics as to how this failure might have expressed itself in Ephesus, </p>
<p>the clue is most likely to be found in the following admonition that </p>
<p>they repent and do the things you did at rst. e reason this failure </p>
<p>calls for repentance is found in John’s Gospel: “By this everyone will </p>
<p>know that you are my disciples, if you love one another” (13:35). eir </p>
<p>failure at this key point means that the gospel as good news for sinners </p>
<p>can no longer be heard for the good news that it is. us the call for </p>
<p>repentance, and the threat that follows.</p>
<p>e signicance of this failure in terms of Johannine Christianity</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is to be found in the admonition, consider how far you have fallen!, </p>
<p>which is followed by a warning that at the same time keeps the im-</p>
<p>agery intact: If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove </p>
<p>your lampstand from its place. is particular warning has created </p>
<p>no end of trouble for later believers, who for the most part perceive the </p>
<p>punishment to far exceed the crime. But that says more about us than </p>
<p>it does about the author of the Johannine literature, since he perceived </p>
<p>the whole of the Christian faith to be a matter of experiencing God’s </p>
<p>love for us through Christ and then returning that love to him by loving </p>
<p>others. From his perspective, to fail at this point is to fail exceedingly—</p>
<p>if not altogether—which is why for him the “punishment” is precisely </p>
<p>in keeping with the “crime.” And “love” for John is not simply a matter </p>
<p>of attitude toward others; the only love worthy of the name from his </p>
<p>perspective lies in their doing the things you did at rst. us the only </p>
<p>correct response to their current failure is to “repent.”</p>
<p>e tension John feels for this church, a church with which tradi-</p>
<p>tion tells us he had a long and enduring relationship, is to be found in </p>
<p>a second word of praise (a phenomenon unique to this letter). us, as </p>
<p>though loathe to let the last word to them be one of censure and warn-</p>
<p>ing, he adds, But you have this in your favor: You hate the practices </p>
<p>4. On this matter see esp. John 14–17 and all of 1 and 2 John.</p>
