<p>Revelation 16:1–21</p>
<p>216</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>e second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it </p>
<p>turned into blood like that of a dead person, and every living thing </p>
<p>in the sea died.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>e third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs </p>
<p>of water, and they became blood. </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>en I heard the angel in charge </p>
<p>of the waters say:</p>
<p>“You are just in these judgments, O Holy One,</p>
<p> you who are and who were,</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>for they have shed the blood of your people </p>
<p>and your prophets,</p>
<p>and you have given them blood to drink as they deserve.”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>And I heard the altar respond:</p>
<p>“Yes, Lord God Almighty,</p>
<p> true and just are your judgments.”</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>e fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and the sun </p>
<p>was allowed to scorch people with re. </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>ey were seared by the </p>
<p>intense heat and they cursed the name of God, who had control </p>
<p>over these plagues, but they refused to repent and glorify him.</p>
<p>As noted above, the Exodus imagery in this passage is sustained to </p>
<p>the very end, so that even the Greek word for “bowl” used here occurs </p>
<p>regularly in the Septuagint for that especially used in the cultus, as de-</p>
<p>lineated in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers. Also noted, the rst four </p>
<p>bowls correspond largely with the rst four trumpets—on the land, sea, </p>
<p>rivers, and sun. In this case they are directed especially against those </p>
<p>who bear the mark of the beast and have worshiped its image (v. 2). At </p>
<p>the same time these plagues have a considerably eschatological ring to </p>
<p>them, so that, for example, “every living thing in the sea died” (v. 3). </p>
<p>e net result, therefore, is a dramatic and powerful prophetic word </p>
<p>directed especially against the Empire for its (upcoming) slaughter of </p>
<p>believers.</p>
<p>In some ways the most striking thing about what follows is the </p>
<p>way it begins, and now one has a better sense of the why of the preced-</p>
<p>ing preamble, because what John heard next was a loud voice from </p>
<p>the temple.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>In context this now means “the temple” that appeared in</p>
<p>7. e original NIV had a third line in this bicolon, “because you have so judged”; </p>
<p>but that seemed to be guesswork on the part of the original translators, and has rightly </p>
<p>been removed from the current text.</p>
<p>8. Given the overall Isaianic context of this passage, this language may be an echo </p>
