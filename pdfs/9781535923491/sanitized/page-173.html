the divine will. en in his typically repetitive style, John adds, is is
<p>how anyone who wants to harm them must die.</p>
is armation of divine protection for the two witnesses is fol-
<p>lowed by a description of the eectiveness of their witness (v. 6). ey </p>
<p>come in the power of Elijah and Moses, so that what God intends by </p>
<p>their witness will be accomplished. us, as with the prophet Elijah,</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> </p>
<p>they have power to shut up the heavens so that it will not rain during </p>
<p>the time they are prophesying. John’s primary intent with these words </p>
<p>is not to suggest that his contemporary church will perform these kinds </p>
<p>of miracles—although that would not be excluded—but that God would </p>
oversee their time of “prophesying” in Christ’s name with divine pro-
<p>tection. Similarly, as with Moses in Egypt, they have power to turn the </p>
<p>water into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as </p>
<p>oen as they want. ese twin clauses point to a period of time when </p>
<p>the church’s witness would be basically unhindered, and would con-</p>
<p>tinue to be accompanied by mighty signs and wonders. John’s intent at </p>
<p>this point is thus to encourage his contemporary church to continue to </p>
<p>bear witness to Christ in an increasingly hostile environment.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the time of evangelism and encouragement would be </p>
<p>limited, thus John foresees a time when they will have nished their </p>
<p>testimony; and with that he looks forward to a more gruesome future </p>
<p>for the people of God. He begins by picking up imagery from the nal </p>
<p>description of the h trumpet (9:11, “the angel of the Abyss” called </p>
<p>“Apollyon”/“Destroyer”), now noted as the beast that comes up from </p>
<p>the Abyss. en with a direct echo of Daniel 7:21, he announces that the </p>
<p>beast at that time will attack them, and will overpower them and kill </p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>is is further use of Holy War imagery, which will be picked</p>
<p>up in detail in chapters 12–13. As before in this book, one must read </p>
<p>not with time itself as a major concern, but Christian theology. us </p>
<p>what is being pictured is not about when—the concern of far too many </p>
<p>later believers—but of what it is that awaits John’s rst readers. is is </p>
<p>yet another of the prophetic moments in which John is anticipating the </p>
<p>holocaust that awaits those who bear witness (= “give testimony”) to the </p>
<p>crucied, now risen Christ.</p>
<p>37. For this imagery see the narrative that begins in 1 Kgs 17:1.</p>
<p>38. e Daniel passage reads (in a literal rendering of the LXX), “And I was watch-</p>
<p>ing that horn [the great one] engaging in battle with the holy ones [God’s people] and </p>
<p>was defeating them.”</p>
