<p>e Seven Bowls of God’s Wrath</p>
<p>209</p>
<p>7) Great Earthquake (= the 6th seal, plus the 7th trumpet, </p>
<p>joined to the 7th plague [hail])</p>
<p>In keeping with the preceding seals and trumpets, the sixth and </p>
<p>seventh bowls are also separated by a twofold interlude; but whereas </p>
<p>in the earlier plagues the interlude was of considerable length, this one </p>
<p>is so short (vv. 15–16) that many readers tend not to recognize it at all. </p>
<p>us, even though in this case the whole is slightly modied, the overall </p>
<p>pattern of 4-2[-interlude]-1 remains the same, signaled in this case ever </p>
<p>so slightly with the note at the end of the fourth plague that even then </p>
<p>“they refused to repent and glorify [God]” (v. 9).</p>
<p>In this nal case John begins with a considerable prelude, which </p>
<p>places the whole as something he once more “sees” in heaven. us </p>
<p>in typical fashion this last set of plagues is placed not in the context </p>
<p>of God’s wrath, even though that is the language John will eventually </p>
<p>employ in 16:1, but in the context of heavenly worship (vv. 1–4), which </p>
<p>in turn is followed by a description of the necessary preparations of </p>
<p>the seven angels who will “pour out” these plagues “on the earth” (vv. </p>
<p>5–8).</p>
<p>Prelude: The Seven Angels with the Last Plagues (15:1–8)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>1 saw in heaven another great and marvelous sign: seven angels </p>
<p>with the seven last plagues—last, because with them God’s wrath </p>
<p>is completed. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>And I saw what looked like a sea of glass glowing </p>
<p>with re and, standing beside the sea, those who had been victori-</p>
<p>ous over the beast and its image and over the number of its name. </p>
<p>ey held harps given them by God </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>and sang the song of God’s </p>
<p>servant Moses and of the Lamb:</p>
<p>“Great and marvelous are your deeds,</p>
<p> Lord God Almighty.</p>
<p>Just and true are your ways,</p>
<p> King of the nations.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Who will not fear you, Lord, </p>
<p> and bring glory to your name?</p>
<p>For you alone are holy.</p>
<p> All nations will come</p>
<p>and worship before you,</p>
<p> for your righteous acts have been revealed.”</p>
