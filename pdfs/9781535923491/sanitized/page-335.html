<p>Invitation and Warning (22:17–21)</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>e Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let those who hear </p>
<p>say, “Come!” Let those who are thirsty come; and let all who wish </p>
<p>take the free gi of the water of life.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of </p>
<p>this scroll: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that </p>
<p>person the plagues described in this scroll. </p>
<p>19</p>
<p>And if anyone takes </p>
<p>words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from </p>
<p>that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which </p>
<p>are described in this scroll.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>He who testies to these things says, “Yes, I am coming </p>
<p>s o o n .”</p>
<p>Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>e grace of the Lord Jesus be with God’s people. Amen.</p>
<p>With these several items John now brings the book to its conclusion, </p>
<p>with a variety of words that tumble out in dramatic fashion. He begins </p>
<p>with another invitation (v. 17), which he then follows with a nal warn-</p>
<p>ing (vv. 18–19), which echoes Deuteronomy 4:1–2 and 29:19–20. at </p>
<p>in turn, and again typically, is followed by a nal word of assurance (v. </p>
<p>20a), to which John then responds (v. 20b) before signing o with a </p>
<p>grace that concludes the Revelation as a letter.</p>
<p>e nal invitation now comes from the Spirit and the bride—</p>
<p>the Spirit who has inspired the whole book, and “the bride”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> being im-</p>
<p>agery for the chief participants in the story. e latter refers to John’s </p>
<p>own churches who rst appear as the bride of Christ in the anticipatory </p>
<p>vision in 19:7–9, where she is the star attraction at the “wedding sup-</p>
<p>per of the Lamb,” and again in 21:3 above (q.v.). us the Spirit and </p>
<p>the church oer the rst invitation, Come! en, in keeping with the </p>
<p>reading-hearing phenomenon pointed out in 1:3, John invites not the </p>
<p>“readers,” as we would tend to do, but those who hear to invite others </p>
<p>with a second Come! Finally, in a culture where water is as precious as </p>
<p>food itself, John himself oers the invitation, Let those who are thirsty </p>
<p>come, which is followed by the ultimate drink, the free gi of the water </p>
<p>of life.</p>
<p>2. In one of those wonderful serendipitous moments of one’s life, I was writing this </p>
<p>part of the commentary the day before being one of the ociants at a wedding, where </p>
<p>the bride and groom are young friends in our church house group.</p>
