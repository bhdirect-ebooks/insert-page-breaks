<p>Revelation 19:11–21</p>

<p>the beast and false prophet (v. 20, by way of a passive verb), and as the </p>
<p>one whose sword has slaughtered the “rest” (v. 21).</p>
<p>What comes next is thus typical of John’s narrative style. Whereas </p>
<p>ordinary narrative logic would go on to describe the battle and its out-</p>
<p>come, John turns the whole scene into a meal for the carrion-eating </p>
<p>fowl—vultures, eagles, buzzards. He begins, typically, with another </p>
<p>angel, this time an angel standing in the sun, who presents the invita-</p>
<p>tion, again in a loud voice. e recipients of the invitation are all the </p>
<p>birds ying in midair, who are invited to come, gather together for </p>
<p>the great supper of God. At this point the reader must do a double </p>
<p>take, since this is the second invitation to a meal, and it comes shortly </p>
<p>aer the rst one, which is to believers, “who are invited to the wedding </p>
<p>supper of the Lamb” (v. 9). But the present supper, “the great supper of </p>
<p>God,” is not for people but for the vultures, who will get to “gorge them-</p>
<p>selves” (v. 21) on human esh. eir fare in turn will be those who are </p>
<p>to be defeated in the Last Battle, starting with the royals (kings), then </p>
<p>the military brass (generals), then all others of political and economic </p>
<p>importance (the mighty), then the cavalry (horses and their riders), </p>
<p>and nally the whole populace (the esh of all people, free and slave, </p>
<p>great and small).</p>
<p>Since this invitation to the carrion-eating fowl is a giveaway as </p>
<p>to its outcome, John’s interest is obviously not on the battle as such; </p>
<p>nonetheless it is described briey in verse 19 as the next thing John </p>
<p>saw, namely, the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies. </p>
<p>ese kings and their armies are now pictured as gathered together to </p>
<p>make war on Christ and the “armies of heaven.” But that is obviously </p>
<p>a futile move, since the rider on the horse and his army, whoever the </p>
<p>latter might have been perceived to be in John’s own mind, are the clear </p>
<p>and certain victors in this battle. Hence the rest of the narrative takes </p>
<p>the reader back to chapter 13, where the beast rst appears. Now we </p>
<p>are told that the beast was captured, as was the second beast, where </p>
<p>the imagery as such is now dropped in favor of plain language regard-</p>
<p>ing the cult of the emperor: the false prophet who had performed the </p>
<p>signs on his behalf.</p>
<p>From the Johannine perspective—and one must take seriously the </p>
<p>probability that “magic” was indeed a part of the repertoire of these </p>
<p>early magicians—their “signs” had been responsible in part for having </p>
<p>deluded those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped </p>
