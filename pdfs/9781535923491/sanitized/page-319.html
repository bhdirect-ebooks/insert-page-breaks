<p>e New Jerusalem, the Bride of the Lamb</p>
<p>297</p>
<p>Now John himself is on higher mountain, from which the angel </p>
<p>showed him the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven </p>
<p>from God.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>us even though what he is shown is a “city,” all of this is</p>
<p>now imagery for the nal glory of God’s people themselves. From his </p>
<p>mountain perch John could see that the “new Jerusalem” shone with </p>
<p>the glory of God, a city whose brilliance was similar to what John saw </p>
<p>in front of the One sitting on the throne in 4:3, like that of a very pre-</p>
<p>cious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.</p>
<p>e rest of the present vision is then given over to a brief descrip-</p>
<p>tion of “the Holy City” itself. First mentioned is that it had a great, </p>
<p>high wall, which turns out to be high indeed when its dimensions are </p>
<p>given below (in our v. 16). But John saves his full description of the </p>
<p>city until he has dealt with its twelve gates, and further on, its twelve </p>
<p>foundations. us he begins with the gates, which had twelve angels at </p>
<p>them, apparently guarding them. What comes next should be no sur-</p>
<p>prise, given John’s interest throughout his narrative to connect the for-</p>
<p>mer covenant with the present one;</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>thus on the gates were written the</p>
<p>names of the twelve tribes of Israel. ese gates are then placed three </p>
<p>to each side of the wall: three . . . on the east, which always comes rst </p>
<p>in such narratives; while the rest crisscross, with three on the north, </p>
<p>three on the south and three on the west. e description then con-</p>
<p>cludes with the inclusion of the new covenant participants, so that the </p>
<p>wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names </p>
<p>of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. Typically, in both cases the names </p>
<p>of the twelve tribes and of the twelve apostles are not given, since John’s </p>
<p>focus is not on who they were specically, but on both their number </p>
<p>and what they represent.</p>
<p>e Physical Description of the City, Part 2 (21:15–21)</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>e angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to </p>
<p>measure the city, its gates and its walls. </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>e city was laid out like </p>
<p>a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod </p>
<p>6. Again, John’s language here is a deliberate echo of Ezekiel, this time 40:2: “In </p>
<p>visions of God he took me to the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain, on </p>
<p>whose south side were some buildings that looked like a city.”</p>
<p>7. On this matter see especially the imagery in ch. 7, where the “twelve tribes” </p>
<p>are followed by an “innumerable multitude . . . from every nation, tribe, people and </p>
<p>language.”</p>
