<p>Revelation 17:1–18</p>
<p>240</p>
<p>yet received a kingdom, they will nonetheless soon receive authority </p>
<p>as kings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he sees that they will join forces and thus “receive </p>
<p>authority” along with the beast. Again, John’s present concern is not </p>
<p>with historical precision, but historical reality, namely that the ten kings </p>
<p>together have one purpose: to give their power and authority to the </p>
<p>beast, thus to give him their allegiance. Almost certainly this is John’s </p>
<p>way of picturing the petty kings of Asia Minor and elsewhere as soon </p>
<p>to join forces in an attempt to stamp out any reminder of those who </p>
<p>proclaim as “Lord” not Caesar, but a lowly Jewish itinerant who had </p>
<p>been crucied by Caesar as yet one more messianic pretender, as “King </p>
<p>of the Jews.” But the risen Jesus simply will not go away, so prophetically </p>
<p>John sees what will come next. ese combined forces will make war </p>
<p>against the Lamb, which in this case, since the Lamb stands in heaven </p>
<p>before the throne (5:6), can only mean “war against his followers.” But </p>
<p>now, with clear echoes of the promised word in 12:11, John’s readers are </p>
<p>promised that the Lamb will triumph over them (the ten kings and the </p>
<p>beast), and will do so because he alone—not Caesar—is Lord over all </p>
<p>lords and King above all kings. Here emerges once again the very high </p>
<p>Christology of this book, where Old Testament language used speci-</p>
<p>cally to identify the God of Israel</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>is now transferred to Christ. us</p>
<p>despite the soon-to-be-released holocaust against the Lamb’s people, </p>
<p>John foresees that at the Lamb’s coming triumph, with him will be his </p>
<p>called, chosen and faithful followers.</p>
<p>Finally, the reader should not lightly pass over John’s order of </p>
<p>“called, chosen and faithful”; their being “called” is evidence of their </p>
<p>having been “chosen.” At the same time he will not let the former two </p>
<p>realities be the only ones; the Lamb’s “followers” are recognized nally </p>
<p>because they are also “faithful.”</p>
