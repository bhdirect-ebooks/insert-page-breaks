<p>e Last Words of Christ</p>
<p>311</p>
<p>Christ begins with the now familiar imperative look, which in this </p>
<p>case is followed by the equally familiar announcement I am coming </p>
<p>soon, words spoken earlier in 3:11 to one of the two faithful churches </p>
<p>(Philadelphia). As before (in v. 7, q.v.) the adverb “soon” is quite am-</p>
<p>biguous as to whether John intends “soon-ness” or “suddenness.” In any </p>
<p>case, and now echoing Isaiah 40:10, Christ announces that my reward </p>
<p>is with me, which as in the Isaiah passage is (almost certainly) spoken </p>
<p>to the faithful, since later (v. 15) they stand in contrast to those on the </p>
<p>outside. Also in keeping with the perspective throughout, the “reward” </p>
<p>is given to everyone according to what they have done. is is followed </p>
<p>by two further inclusios with the vision of Christ in chapter 1. First, and </p>
<p>thus once more indicating John’s very high Christology, Christ declares </p>
<p>in the language used by God the Father in 1:8, I am the Alpha and the </p>
<p>Omega. is is followed appositionally with language used previously </p>
<p>by Christ in 1:17, “I am the First and the Last,” to which John adds </p>
<p>somewhat redundantly, the Beginning and the End.</p>
<p>Next comes the seventh and nal beatitude in the book, which in </p>
<p>this case is a nely woven combination of language from earlier in the </p>
<p>book. us the blessed in this case are those who wash their robes, </p>
<p>echoing 7:14, where the robes are “washed . . . and made white in the </p>
<p>blood of the Lamb.” Having done so, they now may have the right to </p>
<p>the tree of life, echoing the promise made to the church in Ephesus </p>
<p>in 2:7. is in turn gives them entrance into the eternal city itself, de-</p>
<p>scribed in the immediately preceding passage (21:9–28): and may go </p>
<p>through the gates into the city.</p>
<p>In keeping with the tenor of the entire book, the “blessed” re-</p>
<p>deemed ones are then set out in immediate contrast to all the others </p>
<p>who do not “have the right to the tree of life.” In doing so John echoes </p>
<p>the similar, and singular, contrast presented in verse 8 in the vision that </p>
<p>introduces these nal matters (the renewed heaven and earth, renewed </p>
<p>Jerusalem, and restored Eden). us outside the New Jerusalem in its </p>
<p>restored Eden are the dogs, the scavengers who live outside most of </p>
<p>the walled cities of antiquity and eat whatever garbage they can nd. </p>
<p>“e dogs” are then described in language nearly identical to that used </p>
<p>in 21:8, at the end of the opening vision of a “new heaven and a new </p>
<p>earth.” Now, however, John begins with those who practice magic arts, </p>
<p>and follows with those who in turn break commandment seven (the </p>
