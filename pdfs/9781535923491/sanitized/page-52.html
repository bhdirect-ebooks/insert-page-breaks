<p>Revelation 2:8–11</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>same western end of Anatolia (present-day Turkey), serves as the basic </p>
<p>source of what little later information we have.</p>
<p>Turning to the present text, as with each of the letters, this one </p>
<p>begins with these are the words of him (Christ), who in this case </p>
<p>is described by a combination of two phrases taken from the Lord’s </p>
<p>own words in 1:17–18. He is the First and the Last, which as noted </p>
<p>regarding this phrase in 1:17, is language borrowed from Yahweh’s self-</p>
<p>identication in Isaiah 44:6. us Christ is presented rst of all as the </p>
<p>Eternal One, to which is added the most signicant event of his incar-</p>
<p>nation—who died and came to life again. e signicance of these ap-</p>
<p>pellations for this church can be found in the content of the letter itself, </p>
<p>since whatever else a suering church may need to hear, at the heart of </p>
<p>things is the reality of Christ’s resurrection. Indeed it is content such as </p>
<p>this that drove the leaders of the early church (the church fathers) to </p>
<p>wrestle theologically with this core reality of the Christian faith—that </p>
<p>the Eternal One, without beginning or ending, becomes the Incarnate </p>
<p>One, who in his incarnation experienced our singular reality of death, </p>
<p>but who through his resurrection guaranteed our own future.</p>
<p>In one of the two instances (see Pergamum below) where Christ’s </p>
<p>“knowing” the church is not expressed in terms of “your deeds,” his </p>
<p>knowledge of the Smyrnan believers is threefold, all of which give ex-</p>
<p>pression to the hardship they are currently experiencing because of their </p>
<p>faith in him. us Christ begins with two words about their suering: </p>
<p>I know your aictions and your poverty. e Greek word rendered </p>
<p>“aictions” is actually in the singular, and is the basic New Testament </p>
<p>word for trials and aictions of all kinds—although it is of interest that </p>
<p>it occurs only three times in the Revelation (here and in vv. 10 and 22). </p>
<p>e believers’ “aiction” in this case includes “your poverty,” which is </p>
<p>probably related to their being followers of Christ in an intensely proud </p>
<p>pagan city, where such anti-idolatrous outsiders as these would be </p>
<p>scarcely tolerated. But the living Christ immediately reminds them that </p>
<p>their poverty is only of one kind, having to do with material well-being </p>
<p>in the present world. In the real world, the one where Christ alone is </p>
<p>Lord, their wealthy fellow townspeople are the truly impoverished, as </p>
<p>he reminds the believers themselves, yet you are rich!</p>
