<p>The Dramatis Personae: John Introduces Himself and His </p>
<p>Recipients (1:9–11)</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>I, John, your brother and companion in the suering and kingdom </p>
<p>and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of </p>
<p>Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>On the Lord’s Day I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a </p>
<p>loud voice like a trumpet, </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>which said: “Write on a scroll what </p>
<p>you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, </p>
<p>Pergamum, yatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea.”</p>
<p>If one thinks of the Revelation in terms of a majestic drama, then the </p>
<p>function of the rst chapter is to introduce the reader to the three pri-</p>
<p>mary dramatis personae. us verses 1–8, which function very much </p>
<p>as the preamble to the whole, at the same time introduce the major </p>
<p>“player,” Christ himself. e function of the present paragraph is to </p>
<p>situate the second “player,” the author John, in his own context, while </p>
<p>at the same time introducing his primary readership, who are the third </p>
<p>major “player,” and who will then be elaborated in some detail in chap-</p>
<p>ters 2 and 3.</p>
<p>us John begins with an extended identication of himself and </p>
<p>his present situation, locating himself both relationally and position-</p>
<p>ally. He rst identies himself as his readers’ brother and companion, </p>
<p>which he then elaborates in three ways, held together by a single denite </p>
<p>article (the) and each modied by the concluding phrase, that are ours </p>
<p>in Jesus. e order of these identifying words is especially noteworthy. </p>
<p>First, John is their companion in suering. Interestingly enough, the </p>
<p>Greek word translated “suering” here is thlipsis, a word that will occur </p>
<p>only four more times in the book, three of which have to do with the </p>
<p>present plight of believers (in 2:9 and 10 to describe the situation of the </p>
<p>church in Smyrna, and in 7:14 to refer to that of the martyrs). is is the </p>
<p>word that describes their present situation in the world dominated by </p>
<p>the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> It is a word that also occurs frequently in Paul’s let-</p>
<p>ters to describe the current situation of believers in an otherwise hostile </p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>But John is also their “companion” in the kingdom, the word </p>
<p>he used to describe believers in the doxology in verse 6. Here is the </p>
<p>word that especially reminds them of the “kingdom” greater than that </p>
<p>8. e word is further used to describe the fate of the woman Jezebel in 2:22.</p>
