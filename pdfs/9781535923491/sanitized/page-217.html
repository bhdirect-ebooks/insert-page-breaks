<p>Two Interlude Visions</p>
<p>195</p>
<p>In the overall narrative of the book, the three angels who appear next </p>
(vv. 6–11) serve as the divine response(s) to the coming martyrdoms
<p>portrayed in the preceding paragraph. us, disparate though they may </p>
<p>seem on rst reading, they can be shown to be just as carefully thought </p>
<p>through and presented as everything else in the book. at the three </p>
<p>of them are to be read together is indicated by John’s introducing only </p>
<p>the rst one with the common motif then I saw. Moreover, in each case </p>
<p>they respond directly to previous items in the larger narrative. us in </p>
<p>sequence, the three angels (a) call for the churches to continue their </p>
<p>ministry of evangelism (i.e., sharing the Good News about Jesus) at </p>
<p>whatever cost, (b) announce the coming doom on Rome, and (c) once </p>
<p>more warn believers of God’s judgment on those who would yield to </p>
<p>the pressure of the Empire to engage in emperor worship as a means of </p>
<p>survival.</p>
<p>What John saw next was another angel ying in midair. In light </p>
<p>of all previous mentions of angels, this must mean “another angel, one </p>
<p>who is ying in midair,” rather than “another angel who is also ying in </p>
<p>midair,” which would have been irrelevant in any case. en, in a strik-</p>
<p>ing departure from all that precedes, this angel, rather than a human </p>
<p>being, had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the </p>
<p>earth. At this point in the narrative this angel most likely functions as a </p>
<p>“prop,” as it were, allowing John thus to begin this series not with a word </p>
<p>of judgment, but with yet another call to faith. is is the only appear-</p>
<p>ance of the term “eternal gospel” in the book, and with it John reminds </p>
<p>his readers, as he does similarly in chapter 12, that the good news about </p>
<p>Jesus has its beginnings in eternity, not just when Jesus had made his </p>
<p>earthly appearance several decades earlier. And as always, John sees the </p>
<p>gospel as good news for everyone, so “those who live on the earth” are </p>
<p>now for the sixth time (of seven) spelled out in terms of every nation, </p>
<p>tribe, language, and people.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>In light of this preamble, one is therefore taken a bit by surprise at </p>
<p>the content of what the angel had to proclaim. To be sure, the rst part </p>
<p>is easy enough. Speaking with a loud voice, he called on them to fear </p>
<p>God and give him glory. is is then followed not with any content of </p>
<p>the gospel itself, but with the reason for people to do so, namely, be-</p>
<p>cause the hour of his judgment has come. is phrase oers the reader </p>
<p>21. See p. 85 n. 4.</p>
