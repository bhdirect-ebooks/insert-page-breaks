<p>Revelation 17:1—19:10</p>
<p>230</p>
<p>a) the vision of the saints in heaven singing the song of Moses </p>
<p>and of the Lamb (15:3);</p>
<p>b) the last seven plagues (ch. 16), the rst four of which echo </p>
<p>the rst four trumpets, but with intensied natural disasters </p>
<p>against the followers of the beast, while the sixth (and the sec-</p>
<p>ond half of the interlude) looks forward to the Last Battle;</p>
<p>c) and the great earthquake and the destruction of Babylon </p>
<p>(16:17–21).</p>
<p>ese are the same three matters that are now played in reverse in </p>
<p>17:1–22:5:</p>
<p>c) the destruction of Babylon, as the forsaken harlot, whose </p>
<p>doom has come (17:1–19:10);</p>
<p>b) the Last Battle itself (19:11–20:15);</p>
<p>a) and the New Jerusalem, now as a bride adorned for marriage </p>
<p>with the Lamb (21:1–22:5).</p>
<p>In this view of things, the present narrative functions as a pro-</p>
<p>phetic introduction to the fall of Babylon. It is also simultaneously one </p>
<p>of the clearest and most complex of the visions in the book. Its clarity </p>
<p>is to be found in some of the identications, which John again makes </p>
<p>sure his readers cannot possibly miss. Its complexity is to be found in </p>
<p>the uid nature of other moments of identication in the book, which </p>
<p>are the result of four factors: (1) the complexity of Rome itself, which is </p>
<p>variously pictured as the Empire (primarily as “the beast”), as the city </p>
<p>from which the Empire originated (the “prostitute”), and as its succes-</p>
<p>sion of emperors (the “heads” of the beast); (2) John’s use of the Nero </p>
redivivus legend as part of his picture of the succession of emperors; (3)
<p>his use of this same legend to picture (at least in part) the overthrow of </p>
<p>the Empire in terms of the kings of the East; and (4) his use of the vision </p>
<p>of Daniel 7 as part of the imagery itself (a beast with ten horns). Much </p>
<p>of this must be kept in mind in order for the reader to track with John </p>
<p>through this striking, but sometimes bewildering, attempt to identify </p>
<p>Rome as the woman dressed in “scarlet [and purple]” sitting on the </p>
<p>“scarlet beast,” the Empire.</p>
