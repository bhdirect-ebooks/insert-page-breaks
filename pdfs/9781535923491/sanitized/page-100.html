<p>Revelation 5:1–4</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>John’s Greek says simply “nor to look at it.” And John means in this case </p>
<p>literally “look” rather than “read,” since what follows is intended to be </p>
<p>something of a diorama to be visualized rather than a text simply to be </p>
<p>read, even though it comes to his readers in words.</p>
<p>With yet another moment of heightening the aect of the narra-</p>
<p>tive on the reader’s consciousness, John concludes these introductory </p>
<p>words with a note about his own response to this inability on the part of </p>
<p>any creature, heavenly or earthly, “to open the scroll or even look inside </p>
<p>it.” He wept and wept, a reduplication in English that nicely captures </p>
<p>the sense of John’s “I kept on weeping much.” And with this, one is now </p>
<p>made aware of John’s own personal role in bringing life to the narrative. </p>
<p>His profuse weeping in this case should not be taken as “sobbing,” in the </p>
<p>sense of wailing over loss. Rather, John is emphasizing the importance </p>
<p>of the scroll, and thus heightening the reader’s anticipation for what fol-</p>
<p>lows. He does this by pointing out his instinctive expression of sorrow, </p>
<p>brought on because for something as obviously important as this scroll </p>
<p>there was no one found who was worthy to open the scroll or look </p>
<p>inside it. What is at stake for John in this narrative is therefore not abil-</p>
<p>ity per se, but ability based on worthiness. is will be made especially </p>
<p>clear in the rst two of the following songs in verses 9 and 11, where each </p>
<p>begins with the acclamation “worthy.” us what causes John to weep </p>
<p>so profusely is his instinctive awareness of both the importance of the </p>
<p>scroll and the fact that “no one” else in the heavenly throng is “worthy” </p>
<p>in the sense that only the Lamb could be. With that the scene is now set </p>
<p>for the next moment in the narrative, and the reader is given notice to </p>
<p>be especially alert for the unveiling that will follow. e contrasts turn </p>
<p>out to be particularly vivid: in a context where constant praise and sing-</p>
<p>ing abound in heaven, John is found weeping profusely.</p>
<p>The Lion Who Is a Lamb (5:5–6)</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>en one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! See, the Lion of </p>
<p>the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to </p>
<p>open the scroll and its seven seals.”</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>en I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing in </p>
<p>the center before the throne, encircled by the four living creatures </p>
