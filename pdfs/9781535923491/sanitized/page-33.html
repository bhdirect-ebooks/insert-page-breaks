<p>anic, John acclaims Christ’s second coming up front in his Apocalypse. </p>
<p>But his immediate interest is not on the salvation-of-God’s-people as-</p>
<p>pect of that coming, but on its aect on those who do not know him. </p>
<p>us in the language of Daniel he rst announces Christ’s coming: </p>
<p>Look, he is coming with the clouds, language that suggests both his </p>
<p>coming from the heavenly realm and doing so with great power. en </p>
<p>picking up from Zechariah, John adds, and every eye will see him. His </p>
<p>reason for citing the Zechariah passage is found in the next line, having </p>
<p>to do with the believers’ enemies, especially the Romans who were ulti-</p>
<p>mately responsible for the crucixion itself. at is, even though Jesus </p>
<p>had been betrayed by his own people, he had in fact been turned over </p>
<p>to the Romans for crucixion, as one more messianic pretender. us </p>
<p>John goes on with the Zechariah passage: among those who will see </p>
<p>him are even those who pierced him, an indirect allusion to Rome’s </p>
<p>implication in the crucixion that could scarcely have been missed by </p>
<p>John’s original readers.</p>
<p>John then concludes the citation from Zechariah by adding his own, </p>
<p>much broader, application to the prophetic text. What in Zechariah was </p>
<p>a prophetic word about the mourning in Jerusalem over the one who </p>
<p>had been slain is made universal in John: all peoples on earth “will </p>
<p>mourn because of him.” It is not altogether clear what was intended by </p>
<p>this extension of Zechariah’s prophecy, but most likely it is in anticipa-</p>
<p>tion of what it will be like for the Romans, who were responsible for the </p>
<p>crucixion, as well as for all others, when Christ appears again at what </p>
<p>the later church has come to call his “second coming.” us this citation </p>
<p>stands in direct contrast to the doxology in verses 5b–6. e coming of </p>
<p>the one whose death “freed us from our sins” will at the same time bring </p>
<p>great mourning to those responsible for it—a reality that is so certain, </p>
<p>and thus anticipated, that John bursts out with the double acclamation, </p>
<p>“Yes! Amen!,” which the NIV rendered, So shall it be! Amen!</p>
<p>e nal word, however, is not John’s, but God’s. us this remark-</p>
<p>able introduction to the letters and visions that follow is punctuated </p>
by a divine word from the Lord God. First, God announces himself
<p>as the One who embraces all that language could possibly express, the </p>
<p>Alpha and Omega (in English, “the A to Z”), and thus everything in </p>
<p>between. Whatever human language could possibly express regarding </p>
<p>God and all reality, the God who is speaking to John and thus standing </p>
<p>behind this Apocalypse is the eternal, all-embracing God, who stands </p>
