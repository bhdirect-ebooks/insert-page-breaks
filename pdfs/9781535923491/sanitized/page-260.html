<p>Revelation 17:1–18</p>
<p>238</p>
<p>the reign of Nero (d. CE 68), and Galba (d. 69) would be the one who </p>
<p>currently is. But since that seems altogether unlikely historically, one </p>
<p>must assume either that John’s numbers are not intended to be quite as </p>
<p>precise as those who look back on this history would like to make them, </p>
<p>or that he has “telescoped” some reigns so as to keep his numbering </p>
<p>intact (i.e., his repeated use of the number seven). Most likely it is the </p>
<p>latter, since at this point precision as we tend to understand it is not </p>
<p>quite as important to John as is tting the preceding century into his </p>
<p>own literary/numerical scheme.</p>
<p>In any case, John’s concern is with the other who has not yet come, </p>
<p>whoever that might be, about whom he adds, but when he does come, </p>
<p>he must remain for only a little while. All of this has posed enormous </p>
<p>diculties for later interpreters. On the one hand, there is a tendency </p>
<p>toward a kind of literalism that requires a precision John may not have </p>
<p>intended at all; and on this matter this interpreter remains ambivalent. </p>
<p>On the other hand, one must take with full seriousness that for John </p>
<p>“the other has not yet come; but when he does come, he must remain </p>
<p>for only a little while.” e very ambiguity of all attempts to interpret </p>
<p>this literally in terms of the history that both preceded John and was </p>
<p>then in the making for him leaves one with more uncertainty than most </p>
<p>scholars care to deal with.</p>
<p>Equally dicult, both from the perspective of our distance in his-</p>
<p>tory and the ambiguity nested in the text itself, is pinning down with </p>
<p>any certainty what John intended by his nal addition to this scene: e </p>
<p>beast who once was, and now is not, is an eighth king. is especially </p>
<p>complex image is perhaps best understood as a sometime Hebrew use </p>
<p>of numbers, where in this case the seventh becomes the eighth as a way </p>
<p>of intensifying the reality to which it is pointing. In any case, one may </p>
<p>be sure that this rst moment of interpretation has to do with Rome </p>
<p>itself. Probably the most likely resolution of this mystery is that John </p>
is here reecting the common Nero redivivus legend, which claimed
<p>that the hated, heinous Nero had not really died but had gone to the </p>
<p>East, from whence he would return with the kings of the East and make </p>
<p>war on Rome itself.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>If so—and it seems to make the most sense of the</p>
<p>imagery—then John in this case is using a popular legend to suggest </p>
<p>4. One might compare this with the myth that oen circulated aer WWII, that </p>
<p>Hitler had not really committed suicide, but had gone into hiding in order to return </p>
<p>again with great fury.</p>
