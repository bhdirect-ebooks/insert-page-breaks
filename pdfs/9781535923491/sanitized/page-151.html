<p>earth’s surface is something resembling a gigantic furnace</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>(Vesuvius</p>
<p>again). When exposed to the earth above, smoke rose from the Abyss, </p>
<p>which in turn is likened to the smoke from such a furnace. en to </p>
<p>heighten the visual dimension of the imagery John adds that the sun </p>
<p>and sky were darkened by the smoke, thereby emphasizing the enor-</p>
<p>mity of what John saw.</p>
<p>Beginning with our verse 3, John’s imagery now echoes the eighth </p>
<p>plague against the Egyptians in Exodus 10:12–15; thus out of the </p>
<p>smoke locusts came down on the earth. But in sharp contrast to the </p>
<p>Exodus plague, these locusts were not to devastate the green plants; </p>
<p>rather they were to torture human beings who did not have God’s seal. </p>
<p>In true apocalyptic fashion, these locusts were given power like that of </p>
<p>scorpions of the earth. at they were not in fact scorpions, but only </p>
<p>had “power” similar to that of scorpions, is then explained in verse 4, </p>
<p>where the locusts are told to act in a manner very unlike locusts and </p>
<p>not . . . harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree. Instead they </p>
<p>are to act like scorpions and thus “harm” people; but in this case, as an </p>
<p>act of temporal judgment, they are to “torture” (v. 5) only those people </p>
<p>who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> With this im-</p>
<p>agery John picks up and elaborates on the meaning of 7:2–3, where this </p>
<p>protective “seal” had been applied “on the foreheads of the servants of </p>
<p>our God.”</p>
<p>Here people without “the seal of God” are about to undergo a </p>
<p>temporal, as over against eternal, judgment. e locusts were therefore </p>
<p>not allowed to kill the people who lacked the seal, but only to torture </p>
<p>them for ve months. is temporal reference has served as a eld day </p>
<p>for speculations of all kinds. But two matters need to be borne in mind: </p>
<p>rst, this is in fact the normal length of a locust plague; and second, it </p>
<p>therefore serves as a convenient, probably symbolic, way of pointing </p>
<p>to a short time. In any case, what is signicant is that God, not Satan, </p>
<p>initiates this event. at is, even though the event itself is demonic, its </p>
<p>timing and length are under God’s rule, not Satan’s.</p>
<p>10. Although there may be no intended correlation on John’s part, the LXX of Gen </p>
<p>19:28 uses similar language when describing the destruction of Sodom.</p>
<p>11. It is of some interest that here is a case where satanic means are used to mete </p>
<p>out God’s judgment on Rome; but this is something that is probably due to the apoca-</p>
<p>lyptic genre itself. Straight prose would very likely say this quite dierently.</p>
