<p>Revelation 20:1–6 </p>
<p>280</p>
<p>their hands. ey came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand </p>
<p>years. </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>(e rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand </p>
<p>years were ended.) is is the rst resurrection. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Blessed and holy </p>
<p>are those who have part in the rst resurrection. e second death </p>
<p>has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of </p>
<p>Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years.</p>
<p>In this passage, one of the more famous, if not infamous, in the </p>
<p>Revelation, John’s own interests have oen been largely ignored by a </p>
<p>great many later interpreters. Whatever else, John is not at this point </p>
<p>interested in a time period as such, known as “the millennium,” even </p>
<p>though the term “a thousand years” appears a total of four times in </p>
<p>these few sentences. Rather the two paragraphs, both of which begin </p>
<p>yet again with the verb “I saw,” are best understood together as an in-</p>
terlude between the divine overthrow of the unholy triumvirate (Satan,
<p>the Empire, the cult of the emperor</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>) delineated in the preceding sec-</p>
<p>tion (19:11–21), and the nal judgment of all evil, both demonic and </p>
<p>human, in 20:7–15. Again, as throughout, judgment itself is not the </p>
<p>last word. So the book concludes in turn with “a new heaven and a new </p>
<p>earth” (21:1–8), and a “new Jerusalem” (21:2, 9–26), which evolves into </p>
<p>a restored Eden (22:1–5)!</p>
<p>In typical fashion, therefore, John is here again oering what turns </p>
<p>out to be yet another interlude. is time, sitting as it does between the </p>
<p>two parts of the Last Battle, its overall intent appears to be a nal word </p>
<p>of comfort to those who are yet to be martyred for their devotion to </p>
<p>Christ rather than oering unqualied allegiance to the emperor. e </p>
<p>interlude itself comes in two clear parts, marked by the paragraphing in </p>
<p>the Greek text and followed by the NIV and others (NRSV, NAB). e </p>
<p>rst part (vv. 1–3) describes the descent of an angel whose sole purpose </p>
<p>is to incarcerate Satan in the Abyss (from whence he came; v. 11) for </p>
<p>“a thousand years.” e second part (vv. 4–6) then oers the singular </p>
<p>reason for this thousand-year hiatus to assure the martyrs that they are </p>
not forgotten in the divine scheme of things.
<p>us the narrative begins with yet another and I saw,</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>which</p>
<p>in this case turns out also to be another angel coming down out of </p>
<p>9. On this matter see the discussion of ch. 12 on pp. 161–77.</p>
<p>10. e fourth in the sequence that began in 19:11 (cf. vv. 17 and 19), which fol-</p>
<p>lows the sequence of “and I heard” phrases that began 19:1 and 6. is is now the 26th </p>
<p>of the clauses in the book that begin “and I saw.”</p>
