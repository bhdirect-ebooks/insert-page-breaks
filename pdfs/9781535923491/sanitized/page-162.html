<p>Revelation 10:1–11</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>sour. </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>en I was told, “You must prophesy again about many </p>
<p>peoples, nations, languages and kings.”</p>
<p>Turning from the dreadful plagues that are a foretaste of the wrath of </p>
<p>God that is to come, the reader is now faced with one of the more com-</p>
<p>plex moments in John’s narrative. e key to its structure lies with the </p>
<p>preceding set of seven, the opening of the seven seals in 6:1—8:5, to </p>
<p>which this passage functions as the rst interlude. e key to under-</p>
<p>standing would seem to lie at two points. First, John’s own role in the </p>
<p>vision is considerable; in fact there is nothing else quite like it in the </p>
<p>book. Second, the entire narrative revolves around John “eating” the </p>
<p>“little scroll” that is introduced in verse 2 and is nally eaten in verses </p>
<p>9–11, all of which echoes a similar experience of the prophet Ezekiel </p>
<p>(3:1–3). e passage is presented in three clear parts, in keeping with </p>
<p>the paragraphing above: verses 1–4 introduce the vision by way of an-</p>
<p>other major player in the drama, a “mighty angel” who stands with one </p>
<p>foot on the land and the other on the sea and who is holding “a little </p>
<p>scroll”; in verses 5–7 this same angel swears by the Living One, the eter-</p>
<p>nal God, that time has run out; then in verses 8–11 John, in dramatic </p>
<p>fashion, takes and eats the scroll and is given a second commission (for </p>
<p>the rst one see 1:19). Not surprisingly given the nature of its content, </p>
<p>this passage also has a considerable inux of echoes of, and language </p>
<p>borrowed directly from, the Old Testament prophetic tradition.</p>
<p>e introductory moment is full of drama, again highlighting its </p>
<p>signicance for the narrative. is is John’s way of telling his readers/</p>
<p>hearers to pause and take special note of what happens next. He does </p>
<p>this in three ways: rst, the “mighty angel” is described (vv. 1–2a); sec-</p>
<p>ond, he is positioned with one foot on the sea and the other on the land </p>
<p>(v. 2b); third, he shouts with a loud voice (v. 3a).</p>
<p>John begins with another mighty angel, an intentional echo of </p>
<p>5:2, wherein he introduced the rst “mighty angel,” who was associated </p>
<p>with the rst scroll. But in contrast to the earlier vision, which took </p>
<p>place in heaven where John himself had been transported, he is now </p>
<p>back on earth; thus this angel is seen as coming down from heaven. is </p>
description seems to emphasize the divine nature of the angel’s mission,
<p>while at the same time he is positioned on earth for his rst task, which </p>
<p>follows in verses 2b–3. But before revealing what the angel does, John </p>
<p>describes the angel himself, which description has been the cause of </p>
