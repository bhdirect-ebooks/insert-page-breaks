<p>John’s Vision of Heaven—and Earth</p>
<p>Aer being commissioned to write to the seven churches, and in a re-</p>
<p>markable moment of contrast, John is transported by the Spirit into </p>
<p>heaven to see the Father’s throne and the Son himself. e contrast is </p>
<p>surely intentional, and thus the next three chapters must be read not </p>
<p>only in light of what is to come, but especially in light of what has just </p>
<p>been written to the churches. In terms of the overall context and struc-</p>
<p>ture of the Revelation, the seven letters thus serve as the immediate </p>
<p>background for all that follows. e three constants in each of the let-</p>
<p>ters are noteworthy. First, they all begin with a description of Christ, </p>
<p>mostly taken from chapter 1, but in each case tted to their special situ-</p>
<p>ations; second, they all have the identical word of admonition, “let the </p>
<p>one who has ears hear what the Spirit says to the churches”; and third, </p>
<p>they all have some form of the same eschatological promise where in </p>
<p>the language of the Holy War the ones who overcome are described as </p>
<p>“those who are victorious,” meaning in the present and coming strife.</p>
<p>e contents of the letters are lled primarily with words of com-</p>
<p>mendation or censure, and warning or admonition. What emerges </p>
<p>clearly is that the churches are facing an impending crisis. us the </p>
<p>point of praise or censure turns on their loyalty to Christ, and on their </p>
<p>being a conqueror in the coming great conict. e central concern </p>
<p>throughout, therefore, has to do with the coming crisis—and their readi-</p>
<p>ness for it, or lack thereof. Some are facing external pressures, from the </p>
<p>synagogue in some cases (Smyrna, Philadelphia), but ultimately from </p>
<p>the state (e.g., Pergamum, where Satan’s seat is; 2:13). Others have been </p>
<p>facing the threat of false teaching, which some believers have success-</p>
<p>fully resisted, but to which others have largely capitulated (Pergamum, </p>
<p>yatira). Several reect internal weaknesses that indicate that they are </p>
<p>ill prepared for the coming crisis: rst love has faded (Ephesus); there </p>
<p>is compromise with false teaching (yatira); some are living an illu-</p>
