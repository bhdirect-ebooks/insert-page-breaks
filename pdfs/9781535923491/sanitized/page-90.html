<p>Revelation 4:1–6a</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>the throne (4:2; cf. v. 9), around the throne (4:4; cf. 5:11 “encircled the </p>
<p>throne”), from the throne (4:5), and in front of the throne (4:5–6; cf. v. </p>
<p>10; and 5:6); and the next paragraph begins “in the center, around the </p>
<p>throne” (4:6b). is opening paragraph, therefore, is strictly narrati-</p>
<p>val—John’s way of setting out the context for everything that follows in </p>
<p>the rest of the book.</p>
<p>John rst keeps his narrative going with the temporal referent af-</p>
<p>ter this (lit. “aer these things”), but his interest here is not with time as </p>
<p>such, but with the next event in the sequence of visions that he received </p>
<p>as he was “in the Spirit on the Lord’s Day” (1:10). us, as part of the </p>
<p>apocalyptic genre, his own entrance into the heavenly presence is ef-</p>
<p>fected by a door standing open in heaven, which was there before me. </p>
<p>is is the language of apocalyptic, which enables John, while still on </p>
<p>earth, to “see” things above. For this to happen, he once again hears the </p>
<p>voice I had rst heard speaking to me like a trumpet (see 1:10), who </p>
<p>now invites John into the heavenly realm (“come up here”), in order to </p>
<p>show him what must take place aer this.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>For this to happen John at</p>
<p>once nds himself to be in the Spirit. What is more dicult to decipher </p>
<p>is whether John thought of himself as being actually transported into </p>
<p>the heavenly realm or whether while still on earth he was enabled by </p>
<p>the Spirit to see, and thereby have a kind of “entrance” into, heaven. In </p>
<p>the end, of course, this matters little, since all of this happens because </p>
<p>John was “in the Spirit.”</p>
<p>e rst and most signicant reality for John was that there be-</p>
<p>fore me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it. is is </p>
<p>John’s way of introducing God the Father into the vision without ever </p>
<p>using that language.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>In keeping with John’s own theological stance, the</p>
<p>awesome scene of God on his throne is the rst singular reality of his </p>
<p>3. John’s Greek text is quite ambiguous at this point, as to whether the meta tauta </p>
<p>(“aer these things”) concludes the present sentence or stands at the beginning of the </p>
<p>next sentence, especially so since there is neither punctuation nor spaces between </p>
<p>words in the earliest Greek evidence. Later scribes claried this problem by adding a </p>
<p>kai (“and”) at the beginning of the next sentence (and thus the KJV begins v. 2 with </p>
<p>“and immediately”). is is almost certainly John’s intent, even though this usage of </p>
<p>meta tauta is especially strange.</p>
<p>4. It is of interest to note that John avoids naming God at this point, since the </p>
<p>prophets and Psalmists from whom John is borrowing showed no such reluctance (cf. </p>
<p>1 Kgs 22:19; 2Chr 18:8; Isa 6:1); but see also Ezek 1:26–27, whose reluctance to do so </p>
<p>probably serves as John’s forerunner.</p>
