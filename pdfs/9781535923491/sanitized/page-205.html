<p>e Two Beasts</p>
<p>183</p>
<p>ment it is! Here is John the theologian giving his ultimate theological </p>
<p>expression to things, such as one nds in the prologue to the Gospel </p>
<p>that bears his name. For even though “the Lamb . . . was slain” at a given </p>
<p>point in history during the reign of Tiberius Caesar, what the Roman </p>
<p>emperor and his army did not know was that their execution of a sup-</p>
<p>posed revolutionary was in fact God’s ultimate redemptive moment </p>
<p>which had been orchestrated from all eternity—because at the heart of </p>
<p>the Christian gospel is the awesome reality that God the Creator is also </p>
<p>God the Redeemer. And according to John, that redemptive moment, </p>
<p>which began historically with the creation of our planet, was ultimately </p>
<p>fullled early in the rst Christian century through the death and res-</p>
<p>urrection of the incarnate Lamb of God, the Lamb “who takes away the </p>
<p>sin of the world.” And as one is wont to remind his readers, this is the </p>
<p>only God there is! Moments like these are what should cause one to </p>
<p>recognize our “author” (whoever actually penned the book) as the same </p>
<p>man who wrote the Gospel that bears the name of John, even though </p>
<p>his name does not appear in the Gospel in the way it does at the begin-</p>
<p>ning of this book (1:4).</p>
<p>It is therefore no cause for wonder, even if for later readers it is the </p>
<p>cause of some consternation, that John concludes this powerful mo-</p>
<p>ment with the same theme that he did with each of the seven letters </p>
<p>in chapters 2 and 3, which in turn echo the language of Jesus himself </p>
<p>as found in the Gospel records: Whoever has ears, let them hear. But </p>
<p>it is also clear that John is herewith concluding by picking up what he </p>
<p>had said a sentence earlier, that the beast “was given power to make </p>
<p>war against God’s people and to conquer them.” John therefore follows </p>
<p>this call for attention by what is most likely a cryptic forewarning of </p>
<p>what is to come, couched in language borrowed from Jeremiah 15:2. </p>
<p>But whereas Jeremiah mentions four groups, those destined for death, </p>
<p>the sword, starvation, and captivity, John narrows these to two groups </p>
<p>(captivity and sword), but elaborates on Jeremiah’s poetry, thus:</p>
<p>If anyone goes into captivity,</p>
<p> into captivity they will go.</p>
<p>If anyone is killed by the sword,</p>
<p> with the sword they will be killed.</p>
<p>With these words at the end of his long description of Rome as </p>
<p>the “beast coming out of the sea,” John’s reason for this litany is nally </p>
