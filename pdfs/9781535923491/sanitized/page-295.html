<p>In this nal wrap-up of the story presented in the Revelation, the </p>
<p>reader once more senses the tension that exists in the narrative in terms </p>
<p>of John’s positioning himself for what he is about to see and hear. e </p>
<p>Last Battle itself, of course, is to be understood as taking place on earth. </p>
<p>Nonetheless its primary combatant, the risen Christ, has been located </p>
<p>in heaven since chapter 5. But here is a case where, by the very nature of </p>
<p>things apocalyptic, there is sometimes a ne line to be drawn between </p>
<p>heaven and earth. e reason for this has to do with the story itself. </p>
<p>What John is about to narrate is the Last Battle, which can only take </p>
<p>place on earth where the evil powers are; yet the one who engages the </p>
<p>enemy and wins the battle is now in heaven. So what happens is that </p>
<p>John simply sees heaven standing open for a second time (cf. 4:1), and </p>
<p>this so that the Incarnate One, himself now in heaven, may lead the </p>
divine forces on earth for the Last Battle, but without John’s ever mak-
<p>ing a point of his actual location.</p>
<p>e same tension exists regarding the location of John himself, </p>
<p>because what he saw was “there before me,” implying not a vision seen </p>
<p>from a distance, but activity that is now taking place right in front of </p>
<p>John. Since the next two occurrences of the recurring phrase “and I saw” </p>
<p>in verses 17 and 19</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>take place on earth, one must assume that all the</p>
<p>rest of the narrative (including chs. 21 and 22) takes place on earth as </p>
<p>well. What this means further is that even though John regularly takes </p>
<p>considerable (apocalyptic) license in terms of his various mentions of </p>
<p>location, the nal pictures of a “new heaven and a new earth” envision </p>
<p>a renewed and restored earth, not a transportation to heaven. In that </p>
<p>vision heaven and earth eventually become a single reality, which is </p>
<p>located on a renewed earth.</p>
<p>4. e latter, in keeping with the translators’ philosophy of translation, is rightly </p>
<p>rendered in the NIV “then I saw.”</p>
