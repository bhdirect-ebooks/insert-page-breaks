<p>Revelation 1:4–8</p>

<p>fact that only Christ is specically named. Two matters are signicant </p>
<p>about John’s order. First, by his sandwiching “the seven spirits” between </p>
<p>the Father and the Son, John makes it clear that he intends this to be a </p>
<p>symbolic reference to the Holy Spirit. e order itself makes any other </p>
<p>interpretation so highly improbable as to be nearly impossible. Second, </p>
<p>John places Christ in the nal position deliberately because of our </p>
<p>Lord’s signicance to the Revelation itself, which is made clear by the </p>
<p>doxology that follows (vv. 5b–6). At the same time, each designation </p>
<p>has its own signicance.</p>
<p>John rst identies the “grace and peace” as coming from God the </p>
<p>Father: him who is, and who was, and who is to come, a designation </p>
<p>that will occur twice more in the book (1:8; 4:8). In 11:17 and 16:5 </p>
<p>God is designated simply as “the One who is and who was,” because </p>
<p>both of these later references have to do with God coming in judgment. </p>
e designation itself is a deliberate play on the divine name found in
<p>Exodus 3:14, where with a play on the verb “to be” God reveals himself </p>
<p>to Moses as “I am who I am” (or perhaps “I will be who I will be”). In </p>
<p>John’s narrative this becomes simply a means of identication; it will be </p>
<p>elaborated further in verse 8.</p>
<p>e present Johannine designation of the Holy Spirit, the seven </p>
<p>spirits [or “sevenfold Spirit”] before his throne, will occur three more </p>
<p>times in the Revelation (3:1; 4:5; 5:6). It is used by John only when the </p>
<p>perspective is that of heaven. When he refers to the Spirit’s activity on </p>
<p>earth John uses more traditional language, notably as the one respon-</p>
<p>sible for his visions (see esp. 1:10; 4:2; 17:3; 21:10) and as the bearer </p>
<p>of the prophetic word that is being spoken to the churches (as at the </p>
<p>conclusion of the seven “letters” in chs. 2 and 3: “. . . what the Spirit says </p>
<p>to the churches”; see also 14:13b and 19:10). e background to John’s </p>
<p>present usage lies (typically) with two passages from the Old Testament: </p>
<p>Isaiah 11:2, where the Spirit of God is prophesied to rest on the Davidic </p>
<p>Messiah, who is designated by six characteristics (in three doublets), </p>
<p>which in the Septuagint became a sevenfold designation for the Spirit </p>
<p>(Spirit of God, Spirit of wisdom, Spirit of understanding, etc.); and </p>
<p>Zechariah 4:2–6, where Zechariah sees a golden lampstand with seven </p>
<p>lamps on it and with two olive trees on either side (for a continuous </p>
<p>supply of oil), which is explicitly interpreted by the prophet in terms of </p>
<p>the Spirit. John now blends these two Old Testament moments as his </p>
<p>symbolic way of speaking about the one Holy Spirit. ese turn out to </p>
