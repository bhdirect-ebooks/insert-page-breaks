<p>Revelation 17:1–18</p>
<p>236</p>
<p>but with the beast on which she rides, which has the seven heads and </p>
<p>ten horns. Although the reader is hardly le guessing as to her identity, </p>
<p>John waits until the very end to do reveal it (v. 18). e interpretation </p>
<p>thus takes a chiastic pattern with regard to the introduction. e woman </p>
<p>is rst introduced and then the beast; but the beast is rst to be identi-</p>
<p>ed, and then the woman. e beast itself, which is twice described (vv. </p>
<p>8 and 11), is perhaps the most puzzling gure in the book. But overall, </p>
<p>and in some way or another it represents the Empire itself, as it does </p>
<p>in chapter 13. Almost everything else that is said here supports such </p>
<p>an identication; nonetheless the puzzling moment comes in verse 11, </p>
<p>where the beast is further identied as “an eighth king,” thus indicating </p>
<p>again a somewhat uid use of images.</p>
<p>Part of our diculty at this point lies with the repeated description </p>
<p>of the beast as a “creature” that once was, now is not, and yet will come </p>
up out of the Abyss and go to its destruction. is is obviously divine
<p>judgment on something/someone, but it is not immediately clear what </p>
<p>John intends. Most likely he is here simply, but boldly, representing the </p>
<p>Empire as a parody, expressing in reverse one of his favorite descrip-</p>
<p>tions of God as “the One who is, who was and who is to come” (1:4, 8; </p>
<p>cf. 11:17). at is, John is not here trying to say something about the </p>
<p>beast’s role in history; rather, it appears in the current scene simply as </p>
<p>John’s way of connecting the present imagery of Rome as a harlot with </p>
<p>his earlier imagery of Rome as a beast. Rome’s relationship with Satan is </p>
<p>further certied by John’s noting this “beast” will himself “come up out </p>
<p>of the Abyss” (on which see 9:3–11). e fact that the unbelieving in-</p>
<p>habitants of the earth . . . will be astonished when they see the beast </p>
<p>would seem to make this connection certain.</p>
<p>But as well as making a connection with the vision in chapter 13, </p>
<p>John further identies “the inhabitants of the earth” as those whose </p>
<p>names have not been written in the book of life. With this imagery, </p>
<p>which appeared rst in 3:5 and again in 13:8, John is now anticipat-</p>
<p>ing the unfolding of the phenomenon that will be a noteworthy part </p>
<p>of the nal judgment in 20:12, 15 and 21:27. Here, of course, “book </p>
<p>of life” refers to those who are destined for eternal life with “him who </p>
<p>sits on the throne and with the Lamb.” Finally, and with a remarkable </p>
<p>interchange of imagery from 13:8, where the Lamb was noted as “slain </p>
<p>from the creation of the world,” God’s secured people, who now stand </p>
<p>in stark contrast to the present “inhabitants of the earth,” have had their </p>
