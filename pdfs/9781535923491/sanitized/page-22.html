<p>Introduction</p>
<p>xxii</p>
<p>1:20 e seven golden lampstands = the seven churches to </p>
<p>whom John is writing</p>
<p>1:20 e seven stars = seven angels (or messengers) of the </p>
<p>seven churches</p>
<p>7:14 e numberless multitude = those who have come out </p>
<p>of great tribulation and have washed their garments in </p>
<p>the blood of the Lamb (= the redeemed people of God </p>
<p>worldwide)</p>
<p>12:9 e great dragon = Satan</p>
<p>17:9 e seven heads of the beast = seven hills on which the </p>
<p>woman sits (a clear allusion to the city of Rome, famous </p>
<p>for its “sitting on seven hills”); but it also becomes a uid </p>
<p>image and thus = seven kings</p>
<p>17:18 e great harlot = the great city (on seven hills), and </p>
<p>therefore Rome</p>
<p>It is especially important at this point to urge the reader to see the </p>
<p>visions as wholes, and not allegorically to press all the details to have </p>
<p>special meaning. Aer all, John is trying to say something by way of </p>
<p>whole visions, and some details are simply either for dramatic eect (as </p>
<p>in 6:12–14) or to add to the picture as a whole so that one cannot miss </p>
<p>John’s own point.</p>
<p>Finally, with little doubt the most dicult hermeneutical issue for </p>
<p>readers this late in time is to deal with the close tie John presents us </p>
<p>between the temporal events he foresees and the eschatological context </p>
<p>in which he places the whole picture. Modern readers must note well </p>
<p>that for many of the events “prophesied” here, we are now “between </p>
<p>the time” of the two events. at is, some of the temporal events here </p>
<p>prophesied have already occurred, while we still await the nal escha-</p>
<p>tological fulllment.</p>
<p>Finally, as noted in the preface, the translation used throughout is </p>
<p>the updated NIV that is to be published in 2011, to which I have prior </p>
<p>access as a member of the translating committee, and which is used </p>
<p>here by permission of the publishers.</p>
