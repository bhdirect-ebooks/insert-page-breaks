<p>e Lamb Takes the Scroll and Heaven Rejoices</p>

<p>and Redeemer; and to get there by way of hymnic poetry, John sees all </p>
<p>heaven as worshiping the Father and the Son as Creator and Redeemer. </p>
<p>If this is not said as precisely in the Revelation as in the Gospel that </p>
<p>bears John’s name, that is the result not of theological imprecision on </p>
<p>John’s part, but of the choice of genre, where “pictures,” which oen are </p>
<p>as good as a thousand words, when put into words must bear the weight </p>
<p>of the necessary imprecision.</p>
<p>What the Lamb is worthy . . . to receive includes three of the pre-</p>
<p>ceding acclamations of which the One who sits on the throne is worthy: </p>
<p>power, honor, glory; now as the rst, h, and sixth items. To these are </p>
<p>added wealth and wisdom and strength . . . and praise. us, typical </p>
<p>of the Christology of both the Gospel of John and the Revelation, the </p>
<p>more expansive praise and adoration is oered to the Son; and that is </p>
<p>not because the Son is more signicant, but because our existence both </p>
<p>now and forever is predicated on his death and resurrection. at is, </p>
<p>the more extensive language of praise is ttingly reserved for the Lamb, </p>
<p>who, even though he was the co-creator of all things, nonetheless in his </p>
<p>incarnation endured the abuse and rejection of those he had created </p>
to bear the divine image on earth. In doing it this way, John is quite in
<p>keeping with the christocentric emphasis of the entire New Testament. </p>
<p>By means of the Lamb, God both has been made known and has oered </p>
<p>himself in a sacricial way for the eternal redemption of those created </p>
in the divine image.
<p>And with that, the entire throng of all created beings burst into </p>
<p>a nal doxology to both the Father and the Son. So as to miss none of </p>
<p>these beings able to oer praise, John expands the singers to include </p>
<p>every created being in the entire cosmos: every creature in heaven and </p>
<p>on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in </p>
<p>them. But with this expansion, especially the nal phrase “all that is in </p>
<p>them,” he has created something of a redundancy that has le the reader </p>
<p>with a moment of imprecision. What John ultimately intended seems </p>
<p>easy enough—no created being with voice is excluded from this nal </p>
<p>praise. But the grammar itself is strained, since the beginning appella-</p>
<p>tion “every creature” and the nal phrase “and all that is in them” create </p>
<p>a redundancy that is hard to put into meaningful English. Perhaps the </p>
<p>best way to capture John’s emphases in English would be to enclose </p>
<p>this nal phrase with a pair of dashes; thus “I heard every creature </p>
