<p>John then concludes his description by noting that the twelve gates </p>
<p>were twelve pearls, so that each gate was made of a single pearl (enor-</p>
<p>mous pearls, to be sure), and that the great street of the city was of </p>
<p>gold, as pure as transparent glass (again, an unusual gold). e “great </p>
<p>street” itself, which is mentioned here for the rst time, will reappear in </p>
<p>the next episode of the vision, as leading to (or in that case, away from) </p>
<p>“the throne of God and of the Lamb.” e point of all this, of course, is </p>
<p>to indicate how great is the “new Jerusalem,” where God and the Lamb </p>
<p>sit enthroned, and God’s people, “his servants, will serve him.”</p>
<p>e Character of the City (21:22–27)</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty </p>
<p>and the Lamb are its temple. </p>
<p>23</p>
<p>e city does not need the sun or </p>
<p>the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the </p>
<p>Lamb is its lamp. </p>
<p>24</p>
<p>e nations will walk by its light, and the </p>
<p>kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it. </p>
<p>25</p>
<p>On no day </p>
<p>will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there. </p>
<p>26</p>
<p>e </p>
<p>glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it. </p>
<p>27</p>
<p>Nothing </p>
<p>impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shame-</p>
<p>ful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the </p>
<p>Lamb’s book of life.</p>
<p>Here is the section that has created much diculty for those who </p>
<p>envision heaven as a place “above” that believers “go to.” is may t </p>
<p>well with other descriptions of heaven in Scripture, but must not be </p>
<p>superimposed on John’s vision, thereby discounting it. is climactic </p>
<p>moment in the description of the future for God’s redeemed people is </p>
<p>clearly envisioned as still on earth, and exists especially for the sake </p>
<p>of the redeemed—although that point is not made here. Following the </p>
<p>preceding description, the reader might well expect John next to de-</p>
<p>scribe the central feature of the city, its temple, which in eect John </p>
