<p>Revelation 1</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>a whole new world. at will come eventually, but is somewhat rare at </p>
<p>the beginning.</p>
<p>The Revelation as Apocalypse and Prophecy (1:1–3)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>e revelation from Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show </p>
<p>his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by </p>
<p>sending his angel to his servant John, </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>who testies to everything </p>
<p>he saw—that is, the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, </p>
<p>and blessed are those who hear it and keep what is written in it, </p>
<p>because the time is near.</p>
<p>John introduces his book with the word that is responsible for its name, </p>
<p>Apocalypsis, which in Greek means simply “revelation.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>But in these</p>
<p>opening sentences the reader is also faced with some of the idiosyn-</p>
<p>crasies of John’s style, which at times leaves the reader guessing as to </p>
<p>John’s own intent. us he begins here with three Greek nouns, without </p>
<p>modiers or denite article. So did John intend “the revelation” or “a </p>
<p>revelation”; and did he intend “revelation of Jesus Christ,” with Christ </p>
<p>as the object of the revelation, or as the NIV has it, the revelation from </p>
<p>Jesus Christ, with Christ as its source? e reason for going the latter </p>
<p>route is to be found in the clause that follows. e signicance of this </p>
<p>small point lies with the rest of the book, since from here on Christ is </p>
<p>the one who now gives the revelation that John here says God gave him </p>
<p>[Christ] to show his servants. e term “servants” in this case is to be </p>
<p>understood as a general, but especially meaningful, term for all believ-</p>
<p>ers; they are those who serve both God and others.</p>
<p>e content of what “God gave him to show his servants has to do </p>
<p>with what must soon take place, a clause that anticipates the content </p>
<p>of the rest of the book. Unfortunately, this brief clause has also served </p>
<p>as the source of an considerable number of speculations about the end-</p>
<p>times. But as the narrative that will soon unfold makes relatively clear, </p>
<p>this phrase has less to do with the End as such, and mostly to do with </p>
<p>the somber events awaiting the churches of John’s day. Himself an exile </p>
<p>on Patmos, what John had come to see clearly as awaiting a new genera-</p>
<p>1. e Greek word itself, of course, has made its way into English as “apocalypse,” </p>
<p>which by denition for most people means “any widespread destruction or disaster” </p>
<p>(the h entry in the Random House American College Dictionary).</p>
