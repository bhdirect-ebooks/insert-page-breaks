<p>e Sixth Trumpet [= the Second Woe]</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>And nally, before one moves on to the two interlude visions that </p>
<p>come next, one should note the absence here of any mention of the </p>
<p>eagle from 8:13. In the preceding 9:12, John deliberately tells his read-</p>
<p>ers that “the rst woe is past; two other woes are yet to come.” What </p>
<p>is to be noticed here is that he does not repeat this motif at the end of </p>
<p>the current vision; rather he waits until 11:14 to mention this feature, </p>
<p>which can only be deliberate on his part. Whatever else, John is telling </p>
<p>his readers to keep the present six trumpets together with the following </p>
<p>two interlude visions. ey thus correspond to each other in some way, </p>
<p>so that this sixth woe is not over until the twofold interlude (10:1–11 </p>
<p>and 11:1–13) itself is over.</p>
<p>Interlude 1: The Angel and the Little Scroll (10:1–11)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven. He </p>
<p>was robed in a cloud, with a rainbow above his head; his face was </p>
<p>like the sun, and his legs were like ery pillars. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>He was holding a </p>
<p>little scroll, which lay open in his hand. He planted his right foot </p>
<p>on the sea and his le foot on the land, </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>and he gave a loud shout </p>
<p>like the roar of a lion. When he shouted, the voices of the seven </p>
<p>thunders spoke. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about </p>
<p>to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say, “Seal up what the </p>
<p>seven thunders have said and do not write it down.”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>en the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the </p>
<p>land raised his right hand to heaven. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>And he swore by him who </p>
<p>lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and all that is in </p>
<p>them, the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in </p>
<p>it, and said, “ere will be no more delay! </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>But in the days when </p>
<p>the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet, the mystery of </p>
<p>God will be accomplished, just as he announced to his servants </p>
<p>the prophets.”</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>en the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me </p>
<p>once more: “Go, take the scroll that lies open in the hand of the </p>
<p>angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little </p>
<p>scroll. He said to me, “Take it and eat it. It will turn your stomach </p>
<p>sour, but ‘in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.’</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>” </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>I took </p>
<p>the little scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it. It tasted sweet as </p>
<p>honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach turned </p>
<p>20. Ezekiel 3:3.</p>
