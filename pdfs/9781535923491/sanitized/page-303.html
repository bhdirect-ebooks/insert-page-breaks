<p>John follows this by picking up from the preceding account</p>
<p>of “the angel of the Abyss” (Satan himself) from 9:11. In that passage </p>
<p>Satan came out of the Abyss so as to torture people; here he is now </p>
<p>reassigned to the Abyss while the martyrs are pictured as “reigning with </p>
<p>Christ” for “a thousand years.” us the present angel is presented as </p>
<p>having the key to the Abyss, while at the same time holding in his </p>
<p>hand a great chain. What follows, therefore, is a deliberate reversal of </p>
<p>what Satan was allowed to do in the earlier scene, and which exists in </p>
<p>this case not as an attempt to oer a specic time period in the future, </p>
<p>but to indicate that the martyrs themselves have a special place in the </p>
divine economy—God’s way of reassuring the living that those who die
<p>because they bear Christ’s name are not forgotten.</p>
<p>So the angel then seized the dragon, who is now also given his </p>
<p>other biblical designations, beginning with that in Eden, and thus </p>
<p>the reason for the imagery of a dragon, who rst appeared in John’s </p>
<p>narrative in chapters 12 and 13, beginning with 12:3. e dragon, of </p>
<p>course, as noted earlier, is none other than that ancient serpent who </p>
<p>makes his rst appearance in the biblical narrative in Genesis 3:1, as </p>
<p>the malevolent opponent of God and therefore of all that is good. But </p>
<p>for the sake of his Gentile readers, who may miss the imagery, John at </p>
<p>this point makes sure that no reader will mistake the dragon’s identity. </p>
<p>us recalling the identiers in 12:9, the great enemy of humankind </p>
<p>is further designated by his descriptive title, the devil, and then by his </p>
<p>name, Satan. What follows, however, is the clause that has led to seem-</p>
<p>ingly endless moments of speculation in the years that followed John: </p>
<p>and bound him for a thousand years. is phrase “a thousand years” is </p>
<p>then repeated three more times in the brief paragraph. us it appears </p>
<p>twice with regard to the binding of Satan, and twice to note the time the </p>
<p>resurrected martyrs will reign with Christ.</p>
<p>All of this is further complicated by the explanatory addition that </p>
<p>is our verse 3, where the reader is told rst that the angel threw Satan </p>
<p>into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, and that the reason </p>
<p>for this, second, was to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore </p>
<p>until the thousand years were ended. On this note all later millennial </p>
<p>speculation has been based. It is not, of course, that this matter is other-</p>
<p>11. On this see 10:1 and 18:1 above, which together make clear that these angels </p>
are sent directly from God to carry out the divine will on earth.
