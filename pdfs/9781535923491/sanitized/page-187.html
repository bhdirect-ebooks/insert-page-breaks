<p>e Sun-Clothed Woman and the Dragon</p>
<p>165</p>
<p>Israel, while in verse 17 the “rest of her ospring” are God’s new covenant </p>
<p>people, the church. Second, by pointing out her labor in pregnancy (she </p>
<p>. . . cried out in pain as she was about to give birth</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>) John echoes </p>
<p>several prophetic moments in the Old Testament, where Israel is pic-</p>
<p>tured as a pregnant mother whose child is about to be delivered from </p>
<p>captivity (thus the “New Exodus”). For example, in Isaiah 66:7–8 the </p>
<p>remnant returning from exile are pictured as “a country . . . born in a </p>
<p>day” (cf. Micah 5:3). us by means of this marvelous reformulation </p>
<p>of a well-known Greco-Roman myth, and by way of the even better </p>
<p>known Scriptural echoes that have New Exodus overtones written all </p>
<p>over them, the reader with full knowledge of the Old Testament is </p>
<p>thereby set up for what happens next.</p>
<p>e second character in the Genesis story (and the myth) now </p>
<p>makes his appearance in heaven as an enormous red dragon, who is </p>
<p>further described, using imagery from Daniel 7:7–8, as having seven </p>
<p>heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads. At this point those </p>
<p>who read visually are le to wonder what this monster actually looked </p>
<p>like. One can rather easily envision seven heads with seven crowns on </p>
<p>them, but we are not told how the ten horns were placed on the seven </p>
<p>heads.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>In any case, as John himself makes clear in verse 9, this is a</p>
<p>portrayal of Satan as the seven-headed Leviathan, the sea monster who </p>
<p>is also identied in terms of the fourth beast in Daniel 7. And although </p>
<p>this is a picture of Satan himself, “seven heads” may very well also be an </p>
<p>indirect reection of Rome as the city set on seven hills.</p>
<p>Two further matters need to be pointed out regarding this identi-</p>
<p>cation. First, the biblically literate reader will also hear echoes of Isaiah </p>
<p>27:1: “In that day, the LORD will punish with his sword . . . Leviathan </p>
<p>the gliding serpent, Leviathan the coiling serpent; he will slay the mon-</p>
<p>ster of the sea.” If we did not have John’s own interpretation in verse 9 </p>
<p>3. Although John is here reecting a commonplace reality, nonetheless his language </p>
<p>seems to echo that of Isa 26:17: “As a pregnant woman about to give birth writhes and </p>
<p>cries out in her pain, so were we in your presence, Lord.”</p>
<p>4. I should perhaps note here that as the result of listening to my lectures on tape, </p>
<p>two artists from quite dierent settings and in a quite dierent space both sent me </p>
<p>copies of their imagery. e fact that neither could agree on how to image this one </p>
<p>suggests that such attempts are less than satisfactory, since the imagery is addressed to </p>
<p>the imagination of the reader, and no one person’s imagination can suciently serve </p>
<p>so as to replace that of another. On the other hand, one can also appreciate the richness </p>
of the diversity in the human imagination.
