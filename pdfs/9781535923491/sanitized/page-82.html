<p>Revelation 3:14–22</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>love I rebuke and discipline. Indeed, all that has been said to this point </p>
<p>is a plea of love. e armation itself seems simultaneously to point </p>
<p>backward and forward. at is, the “rebuke” is what has in eect already </p>
<p>taken place in the preceding sentences; the verb “I discipline” serves </p>
<p>as a warning that leads into the second sentence: So be earnest, and </p>
<p>repent. e root of the verb rendered “be earnest” is the Greek word </p>
<p>for “zeal”; thus the call is not simply to repent, but to give oneself to it </p>
<p>with great zeal. Repentance, it should be pointed out, is not what those </p>
<p>who are “lukewarm” think they need to do. But as in all such cases this </p>
<p>imperative is not optional; it is the necessary requisite for their being </p>
<p>restored to health.</p>
<p>e nal word to the Laodicean believers, which is one of open </p>
<p>invitation, begins with an attention-getting imperative, “look!,” which </p>
<p>traditionally had been rendered “behold!” e NIV translators have </p>
<p>tried helpfully to capture its sense here with Here I am! is is a call for </p>
<p>a church that thinks of itself far better than it should to wake up; not just </p>
<p>to recognize their actual present condition, but to come to terms with </p>
<p>the fact that Christ is pictured as on the outside, not inside! Perhaps </p>
even more remarkable in this case is the individualization of this invita-
<p>tion. Up to this point, and in keeping with the previous letters, the letter </p>
<p>has been addressed to the community as a whole, even though the verbs </p>
<p>are singular; that is, Christ is addressing the entire community in the </p>
<p>second-person singular. But with this invitation the focus now shis </p>
toward individuals within the community. us what begins with an
<p>invitation that sounds very much like the community-directed words </p>
in the previous letters, now takes on a rather striking individualization:
<p>If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat </p>
<p>with that person, and that person with me. is invitation, it must be </p>
<p>noted, is still to the whole church, but the realization of it is now pic-</p>
tured at the individual level. Whether the Lord’s Table is in view here is
<p>moot, since the overall picture is one of hospitality; and whatever else, </p>
<p>one must be careful not to push such imagery beyond its immediate </p>
<p>reason for being: to call a lackluster community of faith to repentance.</p>
<p>e concluding promise to those who are victorious is in some </p>
<p>ways the most lavish found in the seven letters. Such people who en-</p>
<p>dure to the end are promised the right to sit with me on my throne, </p>
<p>just as I was victorious and sat down with my Father on his throne. </p>
<p>For people who tend to visualize such pictorial language, this promise </p>
