<p>Revelation 2:18–29</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>seven. e town itself was founded as a military outpost by the Attalid </p>
<p>rulers of Pergamum, lying about y miles on its southeastern ank. </p>
<p>By the time of John, however, it had become a town of trades and cras, </p>
<p>especially well known for its purple dye industry and its ne bronze. </p>
<p>Signicant for understanding the present letter is the fact that all such </p>
<p>trades had guilds, which were very close-knit clubs—a kind of local </p>
<p>union—that served as the primary social structure for the artisans and </p>
<p>their families. Each of these guilds had their patron deities, and the </p>
<p>primary social events among the guilds were the festive meals, where </p>
<p>food was served in a context where it had been sacriced to the patron </p>
<p>deity. Very oen these meals became an occasion for sexual immorality </p>
<p>to ourish, where “girls” were made available at the male-only meals.</p>
<p>ese kinds of religious practices had a long history before they </p>
<p>ourished in yatira and elsewhere in the Roman Empire. One en-</p>
<p>counters them for the rst time in Scripture when Israel sinned in </p>
<p>the incident of the golden calf, where the primary expression of their </p>
<p>idolatry did not involve direct worship of the calf, but as the biblical </p>
<p>text narrates it, “they sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge </p>
<p>in revelry” (Exodus 32:6). is same thing happened again in Moab, </p>
<p>where we are told that “the men began to indulge in sexual immoral-</p>
<p>ity with Moabite women, [and] the people ate the sacricial meal and </p>
<p>bowed down before these gods” (Numbers 25:1–2).</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>is is the same</p>
<p>issue Paul dealt with in 1 Corinthians 8–10, where in 10:7–8 he alludes </p>
<p>to both of these Old Testament texts. It was the perfect religion for the </p>
<p>sexually indulgent; create gods who were lustful and sexually promis-</p>
<p>cuous, and then worship the gods that have been created in our own </p>
<p>fallen image. It unfortunately re-emerges from time to time, sometimes </p>
<p>even within an alleged Christian venue.</p>
<p>God’s own attitude toward such sin—the reality in which we most </p>
strikingly share the divine image (the creation of another human being
<p>in our own image)—is among the strongest of the seven letters. John </p>
<p>begins by reminding his readers that Christ is none other than the Son </p>
<p>of God, whose depiction in this case picks up from 1:14b–15a the side-</p>
<p>by-side images regarding his eyes and feet: whose eyes are like blazing </p>
<p>re and whose feet are like burnished bronze. us the living Christ </p>
<p>has eyes that will penetrate to the heart of the false worship that is be-</p>
<p>13. On this matter cf. the preceding letter.</p>
