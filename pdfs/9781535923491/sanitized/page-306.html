<p>Revelation 20:1–6 </p>
<p>284</p>
<p>cording to the explanation of the “second death” in 21:8, the reality of </p>
<p>escaping it exists for all of God’s people, not just for the martyrs.</p>
<p>So John’s apparent intent here is not to say something special about </p>
<p>them, but to make sure that the reader recognizes that what is true for </p>
<p>all believers is true for them in particular. at is, since all of God’s </p>
<p>redeemed people will experience the rst resurrection, it is therefore </p>
<p>also true that all of God’s people are thereby “blessed and holy” and will </p>
<p>not experience the “second death.” is, however, is especially true of </p>
<p>the martyrs, about whom John then concludes, they will be priests of </p>
<p>God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years. Here </p>
<p>again the reader can hardly miss the high Christology, in which the </p>
<p>Father and Son are once more brought together at the Eschaton. What </p>
<p>is noteworthy in this case is that the nal pronoun “him” is singular, </p>
<p>therefore referring to Christ alone. us believers will serve as a kind </p>
<p>of eternal priesthood before God and Christ, but the special privilege </p>
<p>of the martyrs is that they “reign” with Christ (alone) for the thousand-</p>
<p>year period allotted especially to them. Aer all, according to the pre-</p>
<p>ceding sentence this privilege does not include “the rest of the dead.”</p>
<p>What all of this together seems to point to, therefore, is not a literal </p>
<p>thousand-year reign on earth for a special group, but an intentional </p>
<p>reminder to all of God’s people that even though they may expect it to </p>
<p>get far worse before it ever gets better, God has not forgotten his own, </p>
<p>even though for some it may seem to be so. Rather, whatever else may </p>
<p>be true, and as the old children’s chorus has it, all “are precious in his </p>
<p>sight.”</p>

<p>The Last Battle, Part 2: The Judgment and Elimination </p>
<p>of Satan (20:7–10)</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from </p>
<p>his prison </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>and will go out to deceive the nations in the four </p>
<p>corners of the earth—Gog and Magog—and to gather them for </p>
<p>battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore. </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>ey </p>
<p>marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp </p>
<p>of God’s people, the city he loves. But re came down from heaven </p>
<p>and devoured them. </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>And the devil, who deceived them, was </p>
<p>13. From the song by C. H. Woolston (words) and G. F. Root (music), “Jesus Loves </p>
<p>the Little Children,” whose tune was rst written as an American Civil War song, </p>
<p>“Tramp, tramp, tramp, the troops are marching.”</p>
