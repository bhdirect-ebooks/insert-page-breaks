<p>e Fall of Babylon the Great</p>
<p>253</p>
<p>“‘Woe! Woe to you, great city,</p>
<p> dressed in ne linen, purple and scarlet,</p>
<p> and glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls!</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>In one hour such great wealth has been brought to </p>
<p>ruin!’</p>
<p>e eye-catching thing about this second woe is its seemingly inordi-</p>
<p>nate length when compared to the two on either side of it; in fact it has </p>
<p>nearly the same number of total words as the other two combined.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Two matters are especially striking with regard to the present list. First, </p>
<p>for the most part it is composed of luxuries intended for the wealthy. </p>
<p>In fact those in Rome who have republican bents, such as Pliny and the </p>
<p>satirists, Martial and Juvenal, also inveigh against the majority of these </p>
<p>items in a variety of ways. Indeed, one would need only to walk into one </p>
<p>of the palatial residences that surrounded Rome, and all of these luxu-</p>
<p>ries would be in evidence. But equally striking, second, is that this list </p>
<p>is made up primarily of imports, and that Rome itself had very little to </p>
<p>export in return. Here John is dealing altogether with the power of the </p>
<p>Empire in making it possible for the rich to become fabulously wealthy, </p>
<p>and with those who otherwise benet the most: “the merchants” (con-</p>
<p>demned here) and “the mariners” (condemned next). And of course, </p>
<p>most of this kind of wealth had been obtained o the backs of the poor </p>
<p>and the slaves.</p>
<p>us one is not surprised that John begins this woe over Rome’s </p>
<p>collapse by noting that the merchants of the earth will weep and </p>
<p>mourn over her; not for Rome itself or its people, but because no one </p>
<p>buys their cargoes any more. us their sorrow is altogether selsh; </p>
<p>it is not the poor and needy they care about, but that “no one buys” </p>
<p>from them any more. But right at this point John breaks into his own </p>
<p>sentence with a signicantly long list of “their cargoes.”</p>
<p>e background to this list can be found in Ezekiel 26–28, in a </p>
<p>substantial oracle against Tyre, the ancient master of the seas. e spe-</p>
<p>cics in this case can be found in 27:12–22, where there is an earlier list </p>
<p>of cargoes, which John has now specically adapted to Rome. Perhaps </p>
<p>the easiest way to comment here is to oer the list itself and to note </p>
<p>where each item was imported from. It should also be noted that the list </p>
<p>15. In an actual count, including all the articles and prepositions, this woe has 113 </p>
<p>words in the Greek text, while the other two combined have 123 (51 in the rst woe, </p>
<p>72 in the third).</p>
