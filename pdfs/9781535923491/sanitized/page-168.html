<p>Revelation 11:1–14</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>been given to the Gentiles. ey will trample on the holy city for </p>
<p>42 months. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>And I will appoint my two witnesses, and they will </p>
<p>prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.” </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>ey are “the two </p>
<p>olive trees” and the two lampstands, and “they stand before the </p>
<p>Lord of the earth.”</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>If anyone tries to harm them, re comes out </p>
<p>of their mouths and devours their enemies. is is how anyone </p>
<p>who wants to harm them must die. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>ey have power to shut up </p>
<p>the heavens so that it will not rain during the time they are proph-</p>
<p>esying; and they have power to turn the water into blood and to </p>
<p>strike the earth with every kind of plague as oen as they want.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Now when they have nished their testimony, the beast that </p>
<p>comes up from the Abyss will attack them, and will overpower and </p>
<p>kill them. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>eir bodies will lie in the public square of the great </p>
<p>city—which is guratively called Sodom and Egypt—where also </p>
<p>their Lord was crucied. </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>For three and a half days many from </p>
<p>every people, tribe, language and nation will gaze on their bodies </p>
<p>and refuse them burial. </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>e inhabitants of the earth will gloat </p>
<p>over them and will celebrate by sending each other gis, because </p>
<p>these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>But aer the three and a half days the breath</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>of the life of</p>
<p>God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and terror struck </p>
<p>those who saw them. </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>en they heard a loud voice from heaven </p>
<p>saying to them, “Come up here.” And they went up to heaven in a </p>
<p>cloud, while their enemies looked on.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>At that very hour there was a severe earthquake and a tenth </p>
<p>of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the </p>
<p>earthquake, and the survivors were terried and gave glory to the </p>
<p>God of heaven.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>e second woe has passed; the third woe is coming soon.</p>
<p>As with the preceding interlude vision, this is another especially complex </p>
<p>passage. e reason for this is that John oers just enough interpretive </p>
<p>moments to give one a fair degree of certainty about some matters—es-</p>
<p>pecially his overall concern. But these rather clear instances are encased </p>
<p>in symbolic moments that also create some interpretive dissonance; at </p>
<p>least they seem to do so if one follows what might appear to be their </p>
<p>most natural interpretation. In terms of content, the passage appears to </p>
<p>come in two parts (vv. 1–2 and 3–14).</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>But the relationship between</p>
<p>29. Zechariah 4:3, 11, 14.</p>
<p>30. Or Spirit (see Ezekiel 37:5, 14).</p>
<p>31. As to vv. 1–2 serving as a paragraph unto itself, this is in fact the paragraphing </p>
<p>of the Nestle-Aland</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>Greek NT, which also has paragraphs beginning at vv. 7 and 11;</p>
