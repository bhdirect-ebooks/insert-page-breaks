<p>and “every eye will see him,</p>
<p>even those who pierced him”;</p>
<p>and all peoples on earth “will mourn because of him.”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>So shall it be! Amen.</p>

<p>“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is, </p>
<p>and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.”</p>
<p>John follows his rst introduction, which informed his readers that </p>
<p>what follows is an apocalypsis from Jesus Christ, with a second, for-</p>
<p>mal introduction that has all the earmarks of a rst-century letter (vv, </p>
<p>4–5a). However, this is then joined by several features that mark o this </p>
<p>Apocalypse as something unique in the history of literature: rst (vv. </p>
<p>5b–6), a benediction with an appropriate “amen” at the end; second (v. </p>
<p>7), an invitation to the reader to be looking for Christ’s coming, using </p>
<p>well-known language from Daniel, Zechariah, and Genesis, which also </p>
<p>concludes with an “amen”; and nally (v. 8), an announcement from </p>
<p>“the Lord God,” who is identied twice with language that emphasizes </p>
<p>God’s being the eternal God, thus the only God there is.</p>
<p>To get there John begins with the standard greeting of a rst-</p>
<p>century Greco-Roman letter: author, to the recipient, greetings. Since </p>
<p>he has already identied himself (in v. 1), he now begins with the </p>
<p>simple identier John. e addressees are also put simply: to the seven </p>
<p>churches in the province of Asia, who will be identied as to the spe-</p>
<p>cics in verse 11. e salutation itself is very Pauline, and probably re-</p>
<p>ects his inuence on the church at this early period. John has also kept </p>
<p>the Pauline word order, “grace to you and peace,” which, as elsewhere in </p>
<p>the New Testament, is changed in translation to a more normal English </p>
<p>order, grace and peace to you. “Grace” in this context refers to all the </p>
<p>benets that come from God to his people, while “peace” reects the </p>
<p>standard Jewish greeting, shalom. us the one benet (“grace”) comes </p>
<p>from God, his goodness bestowed on his people; the other (“peace”) is </p>
<p>the resulting benet that God’s people experience in their relationships </p>
<p>with one another—and thus is not here a reference to the internal peace </p>
<p>of a “well-arranged heart.”</p>
<p>At this point the salutation takes on a decidedly Trinitarian char-</p>
<p>acter, which is unique to this document in the New Testament, both in </p>
<p>appearance as such (especially in their order of appearance) and the </p>
<p>5. Zechariah 12:10.</p>
