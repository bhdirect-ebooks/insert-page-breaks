<p>Revelation 16:1–21</p>
<p>218</p>
<p>and springs of water . . . became blood. In the present case, there-</p>
<p>fore, both the saline and fresh waters are turned into blood, probably </p>
<p>again suggesting a kind of lex talionis—in this case not “eye for eye” but </p>
<p>“blood for blood.” If so, then this is another truly prophetic moment in </p>
<p>the book,</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>wherein God will execute judgment in kind on the Empire</p>
<p>for its (coming) slaughter of God’s people.</p>
<p>at this is the proper understanding of John’s intent seems to be </p>
<p>made certain by his own—and in light of all earlier moments in the </p>
<p>book, unexpected—pause in the narrative while the angel in charge of</p>
<p>10 </p>
the waters arms the justice of these two expressions of divine judg-
<p>ment on all the waters, fresh and saline. And even though this seems to </p>
<p>get in the way of the neat packaging that the reader has experienced up </p>
<p>to now, John feels compelled at this point to remind his original readers </p>
that the divine reversal will be in eect in due time. us John pauses,
<p>briey interrupting his numerical sequencing to extol God’s justice re-</p>
<p>garding the Empire’s getting “theirs”—“blood for blood” as it were. Is so </p>
<p>doing, this “angel in charge of the waters” arms rst of all, in typical </p>
<p>biblical fashion, that God is absolutely just in this coming expression of </p>
<p>lex talionis, and then follows up with the reason for it.</p>
<p>us the angel begins with an armation of God’s justice: You are </p>
<p>just in these judgments, which he follows immediately with a voca-</p>
<p>tive that declares both God’s eternal nature and inherent holiness. First, </p>
<p>regarding the fact that God alone is the Eternal One, he sings, you who </p>
<p>are and who were. Missing (apparently deliberately so) is the normal </p>
<p>armation of the future as well, “who are to come.” But that is not nec-</p>
<p>essary here, since it has been said oen before and it is already assumed </p>
<p>in any case. e most likely reason for the more abbreviated form here </p>
<p>is the addition to the vocative, O Holy One, which the NIV translators </p>
<p>chose for the sake of English readers to put at the end of the rst line. </p>
<p>is language is taken directly from Isaiah’s repeated “the Holy One of </p>
<p>Israel,” but now without the qualier “of Israel.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, the reason </p>
<p>God is pronounced just in his judgments is as ambiguous in Greek as in </p>
<p>9. “Prophetic” not in the sense of foretelling the future, but of “forthtelling” God’s </p>
<p>sure judgments on the enemies of God’s own people.</p>
<p>10. is rendition is the NIV translators’ attempt to make sense of John’s “the angel </p>
<p>of the waters,” as it is rendered (literally) in most English versions; the NAB is the only </p>
<p>other major English version that goes in the direction of the NIV.</p>
