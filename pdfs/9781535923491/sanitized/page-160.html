<p>Revelation 9:13–21</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>of the people who were not killed by these plagues . . . did not repent” of </p>
<p>these kinds of evils, not to mention all other kinds of evils.</p>
<p>John’s concerns in this overall description of the coming plagues </p>
<p>is both that the God of all grace still holds out an oer of mercy to the </p>
<p>perpetrators—they are being given an opportunity to repent—but that </p>
nally divine justice will come in the form of judgment against all such
<p>forms of human injustice. At issue nally is that the Roman perpetra-</p>
<p>tors (and their imitating minions) have taken on the character of the </p>
<p>“gods” they worship; and so, as we will learn later, they will eventually </p>
<p>get what they actually deserve.</p>
<p>What seems to emerge rather clearly in this narrative is that </p>
<p>these plagues are not to be construed as part of God’s nal judgment </p>
<p>against human rebellion and sin. Rather they are to be understood as </p>
<p>both judgment and warning to those who have been responsible for </p>
<p>the present suering of God’s people. e repeated use of “one-third” </p>
<p>is an apocalyptic signal to remind John’s readers that this narrative is </p>
<p>not to be construed as the nal act. Aer all, despite the fact that some </p>
<p>of God’s people are currently suering at the hands of the Empire, the </p>
<p>h angel’s plague of torture (9:1–11) is seen as bypassing them (im-</p>
<p>plied in 9:4). e way toward understanding the place and purpose of </p>
<p>these “trumpet woes” is to recognize their relationship to the plagues of </p>
<p>Egypt. In the Exodus narrative Pharaoh was constantly being reminded </p>
<p>of the greater greatness of Yahweh, while at the same time he was given </p>
<p>plenty of opportunity to repent. So now, the “inhabitants of the earth,” </p>
<p>those whose enmity against God had found expression in the slaying of </p>
<p>the Lamb and now in the persecution of the Lamb’s followers, should </p>
<p>have been able to see the righteous hand of God at work in the plagues </p>
<p>and disasters that overtook them. But as John sees clearly, instead of re-</p>
<p>penting (= turning about to become God’s people), they rather harden </p>
<p>their hearts and continue in both their idolatries and their sins against </p>
those who are being re-created back into the divine image. One should
<p>also note at the end that, even though the whole is shot through with </p>
<p>eschatological motifs, this vision—in keeping with those that have </p>
<p>preceded—seems intended to be far more theological than chronological </p>
or eschatological in purpose. Here John is establishing God’s own divine
<p>sovereignty over all the events that transpire on earth.</p>
<p>sorceries, who enslaved nations . . . by her witchcra.”</p>
