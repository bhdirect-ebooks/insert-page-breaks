<p>Revelation 17:1–18</p>
<p>242</p>
<p>But typical of John’s overall theological perspective, this is ulti-</p>
<p>mately God’s doing, who has put it in their hearts [the beast and the ten </p>
<p>horns] to accomplish his purpose. What John does next is to interpret </p>
<p>their complicity with the Rome in terms of their agreeing to hand over </p>
<p>to the beast their royal authority, and all of this until God’s words are </p>
<p>fullled. is concluding moment is of considerable theological inter-</p>
<p>est, since from the Johannine perspective, the nal overthrow of Rome </p>
<p>will be orchestrated by God, whose purposes will be carried out by those </p>
<p>who will not have a clue they are God’s instruments of destruction.</p>
<p>At the end of this long prophecy of Rome’s ultimate demise, which </p>
<p>at the same time is a kind of litany over her eventual doom, John makes </p>
<p>sure that his readers have no illusions as to the identity of the prostitute. </p>
<p>us he concludes, e woman you saw is the great city that rules </p>
<p>over the kings of the earth. In the end, therefore, those who beneted </p>
<p>most from her seductions will turn on her and “bring her to ruin.”</p>
<p>One should note at the end how thoroughly all of this is in keep-</p>
<p>ing with the Old Testament prophetic tradition. For example, Jerusalem </p>
<p>itself had been pictured as a harlot by both Isaiah (1:21) and Ezekiel </p>
<p>(1:15). Likewise Nahum describes Ninevah’s barbarities in terms of </p>
<p>“the wanton lust of a harlot, alluring, the mistress of sorceries, who en-</p>
<p>slaved nations by her prostitution and peoples by her witchcra” (3:4). </p>
<p>Similarly Isaiah’s litany over Tyre (23:15–18) calls for her to “take up </p>
<p>a harp, walk through the city, you forgotten prostitute; play the harp </p>
<p>well, sing many a song, so that you will be remembered.” In the same </p>
<p>way Rome is pictured here as living in wanton luxury, and as having </p>
<p>authority over the nations in part by her seductions. But John’s concern </p>
<p>is much less with all that will eventually happen to Rome as it is with the </p>
<p>one stark reality that lies in the immediate horizon: she will be “drunk </p>
<p>with the blood of God’s people” (v. 6). And for this reason God will </p>
<p>eventually bring her down, whose well-deserved doom John goes on to </p>
<p>describe with the powerful series of images that come next.</p>
<p>The Fall of Babylon the Great (18:1—19:10)</p>
<p>In one of the more striking moments in all of Scripture, not to men-</p>
<p>tion all of literature, John at last announces the ultimate demise of </p>
<p>Rome, doing so, not surprisingly, with a series of echoes from the Old </p>
<p>Testament Prophets. At the same time he tends for the most part mo-</p>
