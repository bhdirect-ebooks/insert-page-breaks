<p>Revelation 7:9–17</p>

<p>est at all to John in the present sentence. Rather he is referring speci-</p>
<p>cally to the great trial that the church of his own time is experiencing, </p>
<p>and about which he speaks prophetically as something that will get far </p>
<p>worse before it ever gets better. us what was intended primarily as a </p>
<p>word of assurance to his own readers has been co-opted by later inter-</p>
<p>preters to refer to something that is yet to come. But for John they are </p>
<p>those who have come through/out of the present great trial, which John </p>
<p>anticipates (rightly) lies immediately ahead for his readers. But for all of </p>
<p>that, the two Greek words rendered (correctly) “have come out of ” are </p>
<p>in fact in the present tense (“those coming out of”), not because their </p>
<p>“coming out” is already happening, but because their great tribulation </p>
<p>is already on the scene. ese words thus seem intended to reassure the </p>
<p>churches that any who have been, or will be, martyred because of their </p>
<p>being followers of the Slain Lamb, are to be understood as already in </p>
<p>the Divine Presence.</p>
<p>Second, what makes this both possible and certain is that they have </p>
<p>washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. </p>
<p>One oen wonders how this very Christian way of speaking about both </p>
<p>the means and the end of our salvation might sound in the ears of the </p>
<p>uninformed, since in the “real world” one can neither wash nor make </p>
<p>white by means of blood! But this, of course, is to be understood as </p>
<p>belonging to the long biblical line of redemption through sacrice. e </p>
<p>need for having washed clothes to be in God’s presence goes back to the </p>
<p>narrative in Exodus 19, where twice, rst by command (v. 10) and then </p>
by deed (v. 14), the people were to be prepared therefore for the divine
<p>visitation they were soon to experience.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, that these “robes” have been “made . . . white in the </p>
<p>blood of the Lamb” is an unusual combination. But of still greater dif-</p>
<p>culty is the meaning of the metaphor itself; that is, what are these </p>
<p>“white robes,” made so “in the blood of the Lamb,” intended to repre-</p>
<p>sent? A long tradition in the church has seen this as referring to their </p>
<p>being cleansed from sin, a view that was based on a wonderful merg-</p>
<p>ing of metaphors and texts from all over the Bible, and has found a </p>
<p>permanent place in the church through its hymnody (as in Cowper’s </p>
<p>“ere Is a Fountain Filled with Blood”). Nonetheless, if this were the </p>
<p>intent of the metaphor then such a view (“cleansing” from sin as associ-</p>
<p>ated with blood) would be unique to the entire Bible. In fact, the only </p>
<p>text that actually says as much is the secondary reading of Revelation </p>
