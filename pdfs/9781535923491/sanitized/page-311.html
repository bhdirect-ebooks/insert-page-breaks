<p>The (Original) Tale of Two Cities, Part 2: </p>
<p>God Makes All Things New </p>
<p>Aer the nal judgment, and thus elimination, of evil, John turns his </p>
<p>attention to the great future God has in store for his own. e material </p>
<p>is presented in three rather clear parts. e opening paragraph (21:1–8) </p>
<p>appears to serve the twofold purpose of bringing closure to much that </p>
<p>has preceded, and especially of functioning as a kind of catch-all in-</p>
<p>troduction to the whole. at is followed in turn by an extended de-</p>
<p>scription of the “new Jerusalem” (21:9–27), wherein God’s people from </p>
<p>both covenants appear together, albeit here by way of their primary </p>
<p>representatives: the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles of the </p>
<p>Lamb. e city itself, which “shone with the glory of God” (v. 11), is </p>
<p>then described in some detail, focusing rst on its physical character-</p>
<p>istics (vv. 9–21) and then concluding with an overview of what gives </p>
<p>it its glory, the presence of “the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb” </p>
<p>(vv. 22–27). en, despite one of the most disastrous of all the chapter </p>
<p>breaks in the New Testament, in 22:1–5 the city itself evolves into a kind </p>
<p>of restored Eden, so as to embrace not just a restored Israel (with a “new </p>
<p>Jerusalem,” which has no temple) but a renewed earth as well.</p>
<p>In the end, therefore, even though one experiences something of </p>
<p>a slowdown in the middle because of John’s concern to demonstrate </p>
<p>that the “new heaven and earth” will embrace God’s people from both </p>
<p>covenants, overall the vision simply soars. Here by way of apocalyp-</p>
<p>tic imagery one is presented with the true “restoration of all things.” </p>
<p>Whatever else, and despite all that has gone wrong, “this is [still] our </p>
<p>Father’s world”; and John’s vision assures God’s people that “God is the </p>
<p>ruler yet” and thus a glorious future awaits those who are his.</p>
