<p>R E V E L AT I O N 7</p>
<p>An Interlude in Two Parts</p>
<p>is section of the Revelation has had an especially unfortunate his-</p>
<p>tory of interpretation, due in part to the versication of the text in the </p>
<p>sixteenth century, which made a new chapter out of this material, thus </p>
<p>tending to obscure the fact that it is a continuation of the vision that </p>
<p>began in 4:1. ere is little question that John is moving to a new scene, </p>
<p>but that does not mean movement to a new vision. Unfortunately, this </p>
<p>is also one of the more famous—and controversial—moments in the </p>
<p>book. However, if one keeps it in the context of the larger vision in </p>
<p>which it appears, and asks how it functions in the overall narrative, </p>
<p>many of the diculties disappear—although not all of the puzzles!</p>
<p>e vision itself comes in two easily discernible parts. It begins </p>
<p>with an apocalyptic introduction of ve angels, one of whom (appar-</p>
<p>ently) gives the number of “those who were sealed” (vv. 1–4). With that </p>
<p>some of the puzzles also begin, since the numbering has to do with </p>
<p>all the tribes of Israel—12,000 from each tribe, thus 144,000, whose </p>
<p>identication is then spelled out in detail in verses 5–8. But the actual </p>
<p>naming of the tribes turns out to be unique to this passage in the entire </p>
Bible, not corresponding in detail to any of the several diverse listings
<p>in the Old Testament; nor is it immediately clear how any of this relates </p>
<p>to the New Testament people of God. e second part of the vision (vv. </p>
<p>9–17) then pictures a great multitude of redeemed ones in heaven, who </p>
<p>are so many they cannot even be counted (v. 9). us the reader is faced </p>
<p>with understanding not only the pieces but the whole, not to mention </p>
<p>the role this passage plays in the larger narrative.</p>
<p>Most likely these two narratives are corresponding pictures of </p>
<p>God’s people who will not experience God’s wrath (= judgment) when </p>
<p>it is poured out on the earth, and who will therefore be found safely in </p>
<p>God’s presence at the end—even though for many that may be the result </p>
<p>of martyrdom. is passage is therefore best understood as a continu-</p>
