<p>RE V ELATION 17:1—19 :10</p>
<p>The (Original) Tale of Two Cities, Part 1: </p>
<p>The Demise of Rome </p>
<p>In turning to the imagery of Rome as the woman on the beast, one </p>
<p>comes to the beginning of the end of John’s Revelation. Because this </p>
<p>particular imagery is familiar to many people, the reader needs to be </p>
<p>made aware at the outset of how closely related it is to the preceding set </p>
<p>of visions (chs. 15–16). is relationship can be seen by two features. </p>
<p>First, the present scene opens with one of the two angels from the im-</p>
<p>mediately preceding scene still involved—in two ways: he transports </p>
<p>John by the Spirit to a place in the desert, from which John will see the </p>
<p>unfolding vision; he will also give John the interpretation of what he has </p>
<p>seen. Second, these connections to what has preceded are also discern-</p>
<p>ible in the content of these chapters, which picks up and elaborates on </p>
<p>the seventh bowl—the fall of Babylon the Great in 16:19.</p>
<p>e vision in chapters 15–16 thus served as a kind of prelude to </p>
<p>what one encounters next. It began in heaven with the saints singing the </p>
<p>“song of Moses and of the Lamb,” extolling God’s wondrous works and </p>
<p>ways and his righteous judgments. It unfolded as the last seven plagues, </p>
<p>rst against those who have “worshiped the beast” and then against </p>
<p>Babylon itself—although the judgments were also against those who </p>
<p>have sided with her. Now using the striking imagery of a high-placed </p>
<p>prostitute, John proceeds to give the reasons for Rome’s demise and </p>
<p>then to describe the results (or aermath) of her fall.</p>
<p>us in 17:1—19:10, the city itself—as part of the Empire, yet in </p>
<p>some ways distinct from it—comes under God’s judgments, both tem-</p>
<p>poral and eternal. What begins here, therefore, is a look at the future </p>
<p>that is much more apocalyptic and eschatological than what has pre-</p>
<p>ceded, and which tells the next part of the story in the context of God’s </p>
<p>nal judgments and salvation. is, then, is the original “Tale of Two </p>
