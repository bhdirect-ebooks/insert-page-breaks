<p>Revelation 9:1–12</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>John concludes this opening depiction of the scorpion-like lo-</p>
<p>cust plague by making sure his readers understand that all of this is </p>
ultimately a divine judgment meted out on those who do not bear the “seal” of divine ownership. As throughout, John’s readers are to rec-
<p>ognize their own tormentors as among those who during those days </p>
<p>will seek death but will not nd it, a clause which in typical fashion </p>
<p>for John is then repeated for emphasis: they will long to die, but death </p>
<p>will elude them.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>John’s way of putting it is both more poetic and more</p>
<p>vivid than most English translations are capable of. eir “longing” </p>
<p>will be to die, but death (now personied) “will ee from them,” as the </p>
<p>traditional English translations (correctly) have it. ose who are cur-</p>
<p>rently tormenting God’s people must endure the torture of the locusts; </p>
<p>death itself is not an option.</p>
<p>e ninefold description of the locusts themselves (vv. 7–11) </p>
<p>begins to stretch John’s own apocalyptic imagination, since he is si-</p>
<p>multaneously attempting to keep his imagery alive while also trying </p>
<p>to depict an enormous cavalry of (human) soldiers. us even though </p>
<p>one can picture the apocalyptic nature of such cavalry, to form a men-</p>
<p>tal image of what John actually describes becomes nearly impossible. </p>
<p>At this point John is almost certainly playing on Rome’s ongoing fear </p>
<p>of the “barbarian hordes,” especially those with long blonde hair from </p>
<p>northern Europe. e result is a marvelous collocation of images that </p>
<p>together picture an army of which Rome itself actually lived in constant </p>
<p>fear.</p>
<p>us John’s locusts looked like horses prepared for battle, which </p>
<p>in this case is an echo of Joel 2:4 (“they have the appearance of horses”).</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Eight features are then delineated that are intended to arouse the emo-</p>
<p>tions of the reader, as the picture goes from normal imagery (“horses </p>
<p>prepared for battle”) to the more bizarre imagery of the cavalry itself, </p>
<p>and then back to the “many horses and chariots rushing into battle” (v. </p>
<p>9). Eight features are pointed out in all, each of which seems to be aimed </p>
<p>directly at the Roman fear of the barbarian hordes from the north. e </p>
<p>rst two are those that make one suspect a depiction of the barbar-</p>
<p>ians. With on their heads they wore something like crowns of gold </p>
<p>John is possibly alluding to blonde hair, which was virtually unknown </p>
<p>12. Cf. Job 3:21 LXX: “those who long for death that does not come.”</p>
<p>13. For Joel this serves as the rst descriptor of a plague of locusts, which also </p>
<p>(most likely) represents God’s judgment of Israel by means of a foreign army.</p>
