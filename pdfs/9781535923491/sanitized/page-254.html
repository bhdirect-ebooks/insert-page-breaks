<p>Revelation 17:1–18</p>
<p>232</p>
<p>the role of an alluring harlot. And as history bears out, jilted paramours </p>
<p>can display their own forms of terror.</p>
<p>But the world’s love aair with Rome included not only “the kings </p>
<p>of the earth,” but many (most?) of the rest of the inhabitants of the </p>
<p>earth who likewise were intoxicated with the wine of her adulter-</p>
<p>ies. is is striking imagery indeed, yet it can be easily overlooked in </p>
<p>a quick reading of the text. But John is seldom given to imagery for its </p>
<p>own sake, so he most likely intends something to the eect that most of </p>
<p>the rest of the people in the Empire were well enough served by it so as </p>
<p>scarcely to raise a voice in protest. And those who did protest, of course, </p>
<p>were precisely those who were not served by her, including a very large </p>
<p>number of slaves—especially those consigned in considerable numbers </p>
<p>to various forms of “forced labor.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>But John is not attempting to be</p>
<p>precise at this level; his concern is with the way the larger known world </p>
<p>had rather fully capitulated to the power of the Empire, a power that </p>
<p>in one horric moment in history had chosen to execute his Lord by </p>
<p>way of one of the most cruel forms of torture ever invented. It is, aer </p>
<p>all, hardly an accident that no person known to be a Roman citizen was </p>
<p>ever so executed. us, “intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries” is </p>
<p>a tting image for the Empire by one who was an ardent follower of the </p>
<p>crucied, now risen Lamb of God.</p>
<p>With these opening words, therefore, John is invited by one of the </p>
<p>seven angels to see what awaits the prostitute. But all of that must wait—</p>
<p>for a considerable time, it turns out—as John rst goes on to describe </p>
<p>the prostitute herself at some length (vv. 3–6) and then to interpret </p>
<p>in considerable detail her role in the history of John’s time (vv. 7–18), </p>
<p>which ultimately calls for God’s judgment of her.</p>
<p>e Description of the Harlot (17:3–6)</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>en the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. </p>
<p>ere I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered </p>
<p>with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>e woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering </p>
<p>with gold, precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her </p>
<p>1. e latter tended to fester quite a bit further down the social pecking order, such </p>
<p>as that pictured graphically in Henryk Sienkiewicz’s Quo Vadis.</p>
