<p>e Number of ose Sealed</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>All of this together further suggests that the emphasis for John </p>
<p>rests not in the naming of the tribes as such, but in the numbering. It is </p>
<p>of further interest to observe that up this point John has regularly said </p>
<p>“I saw,” and, in the context of seeing, he goes on to say “I heard.” But in </p>
<p>this case he does not see the sealing itself—and he only hears the num-</p>
<p>bering, which is where his obvious interest lies. e numbering itself, </p>
<p>one should note, is 12 x 12 x 1000, which is the number of God’s people </p>
<p>multiplied by itself and then by the number of completeness.</p>
<p>At least three further matters need to be mentioned regarding this </p>
<p>picture. First, John is not intending something literal, but in response </p>
<p>to the question asked in 6:17 is oering a powerfully symbolic way of </p>
<p>speaking about God’s servants, who have been sealed so as to “with-</p>
<p>stand” when God’s wrath is poured out. Second, at the same time, they </p>
<p>are numbered because they are going to be involved in the Holy War </p>
<p>themselves. us, third, as the next picture makes clear, they will expe-</p>
<p>rience “great tribulation” at the hands of God’s enemies (v. 14), but they </p>
<p>are also sealed and thus will not experience God’s wrath.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>ey are God’s</p>
<p>own people, aer all, and are thus secure, no matter what befalls.</p>
<p>The Great Multitude in White Robes (7:9–17)</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Aer this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude </p>
<p>that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and </p>
<p>language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. ey </p>
<p>were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their </p>
<p>hands. </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>And they cried out in a loud voice:</p>
<p>“Salvation belongs to our God,</p>
<p>who sits on the throne,</p>
<p>and to the Lamb.”</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>All the angels were standing around the throne and around the </p>
<p>elders and the four living creatures. ey fell down on their faces </p>
<p>before the throne and worshiped God, </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>saying:</p>
<p>“Amen!</p>
<p>Praise and glory</p>
<p>1. One of the truly unfortunate features of historic Dispensationalism was the </p>
<p>failure to adequately distinguish between human “tribulation” and God’s “wrath” (= </p>
<p>judgment), terms that are used carefully by John throughout the book and which </p>
<p>never coincide.</p>
