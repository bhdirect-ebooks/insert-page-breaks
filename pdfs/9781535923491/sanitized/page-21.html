<p>rst task is to seek John’s—and therewith the Holy Spirit’s—original </p>
<p>intent as much as that is possible. e primary meaning of any text, in-</p>
<p>cluding apocalyptic texts, is that which John himself intended, which in </p>
<p>turn must be something the original readers would have been capable </p>
<p>of understanding. And this is so even if those readers may not always </p>
<p>have done so, as the Apostle Paul bears painful witness.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Indeed, the</p>
<p>original readers clearly had the advantage over us at this point. One </p>
<p>may readily grant that because our book is prophetic in part, one should </p>
<p>be open to the possibility, as with much biblical prophecy, that at points </p>
<p>there may be a further, second meaning. But one can only know that </p>
<p>aer—not before—the event or situation occurs to which this further </p>
<p>meaning pertains.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one must be careful in this case about using the con-</p>
<p>cept of “the analogy of Scripture” (= Scripture should be interpreted in </p>
<p>light of other Scripture). is is indeed a valid principle; but in the case </p>
<p>of John’s Apocalypse the other Scripture is almost always other escha-</p>
<p>tological passages, which themselves are oen interpreted poorly. One </p>
<p>must always be aware that John does what other apocalyptists did: he </p>
<p>reinterpreted earlier images so that they have new meaning, precisely </p>
<p>because in John’s case he is also speaking as a Christian prophet.</p>
<p>at leads then to some nal suggestions about the interpreta-</p>
<p>tion of apocalyptic images, which in fact are of several kinds. Some </p>
<p>images are constant—in the same way that an American political </p>
<p>cartoon with an elephant and a donkey always refer to the Republican </p>
<p>and Democratic parties. us, for example, when John speaks of beasts </p>
<p>coming out of the sea or the land, he is always pointing to political </p>
<p>empires. Some images are uid, and do not mean for their later readers </p>
<p>what they meant in their sources. And still other images are specic, </p>
<p>while some are general. erefore, interpreting the images in a rst-</p>
<p>century apocalyptic work is the most dicult of one’s tasks. But the key </p>
<p>to this task in the case of John’s Revelation is to hold fast to the images </p>
<p>he himself interprets, since these must serve as the starting points for all </p>
<p>others. Here is a listing of the ones John himself gives us:</p>
<p>1:17–18 e One like a son of man = Christ, who alone “was </p>
<p>dead, and is . . . alive for ever and ever”</p>
<p>4. See 1 Cor 5:9–11.</p>
