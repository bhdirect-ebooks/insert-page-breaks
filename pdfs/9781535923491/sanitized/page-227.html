<p>had the sharp sickle, “Take your sharp sickle and gather the clus-</p>
<p>ters of grapes from the earth’s vine, because its grapes are ripe.” </p>

<p>e angel swung his sickle on the earth, gathered its grapes and </p>
<p>threw them into the great winepress of God’s wrath. </p>

<p>ey were </p>
<p>trampled in the winepress outside the city, and blood owed out </p>
<p>of the press, rising as high as the horses’ bridles for a distance of </p>
<p>1,600 stadia.</p>
<p>Everything about this imagery indicates that it is intended to be a com-</p>
<p>panion to the prior one, even though, as noted above, how it serves as a </p>
<p>companion, either as a parallel or as a contrast, is not immediately clear. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, even though a considerable number of scholars consider </p>
<p>it to be a parallel, expressing essentially the same reality (thus mak-</p>
<p>ing the former also express judgment), that makes the former far more </p>
<p>negative than the text itself actually suggests (that is, only an alleged </p>
<p>synonymous parallel would ever allow such a view). But if the intent </p>
<p>of the former image is not altogether certain, there is no question at all </p>
<p>about this one; it is judgment all the way, signaled not only by the ex-</p>
<p>press language of “God’s wrath” (v. 19), but also by the further imagery </p>
<p>of still another angel, who in this case was in charge of the re, pre-</p>
<p>sumably on “the altar.” is is the angel who then came from the altar </p>
<p>and called in a loud voice to the rst angel, the one who rst came out </p>
<p>of the temple in heaven. e second angel commanded the rst one </p>
<p>to take your sharp sickle, with which he was then told to gather the </p>
<p>clusters of grapes from the earth’s vines, because its grapes are ripe.</p>
<p>e rest of the paragraph then spells out the second angel’s obedi-</p>
<p>ence to the rst angel’s command, an act of obedience that at the same </p>
<p>time tends to stretch the reader’s imagination. us the angel swung </p>
<p>his sickle on the earth, gathered its grapes and threw them into the </p>
<p>great winepress of God’s wrath. e primary source of this imagery is </p>
<p>Isaiah 63:3 and 6, where Yahweh speaks judgment against the nations.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In doing so, John also now picks up language he rst used regarding the </p>
<p>Lamb in 6:16–17 (”hide us . . . from the wrath of the Lamb”), which in </p>
<p>that case had been shared with God the Father, and also later repeated </p>
<p>in 11:18 regarding “the Lord God Almighty.” e language of this latter </p>
<p>passage is what John is here picking up and elaborating, as an expres-</p>
<p>sion of God’s (coming) judgment.</p>
<p>5. e Isaiah passage reads: “I have trodden the winepress alone; . . . I trampled </p>
<p>them in my anger and trod them down in my wrath.”</p>
