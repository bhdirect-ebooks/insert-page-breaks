<p>e Opening of the First Six Seals</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>opening group of seven is a set unto itself, with very little correspon-</p>
<p>dence to the two that follow. In fact in the present case the initial set </p>
<p>of four are not “plagues” at all, nor are they eschatological. us they </p>
<p>are almost certainly not intended to relate to the nal, eschatological </p>
<p>conclusion of all things; rather they have all the markings of a prophetic </p>
<p>word regarding the near future for John and his readers.</p>
<p>is observation is reinforced by the content of the h seal, in </p>
<p>which martyred believers appear, and again by the seventh seal, which </p>
<p>is not an event on its own at all. Rather this seal evolves into the seven </p>
<p>trumpets, thus implying that when the last seal is broken, the scroll </p>
<p>itself is opened. All of this together, including the way the seals are </p>
<p>introduced in the preceding scene (ch. 5), suggests that the seals them-</p>
<p>selves are not to be tied directly to “what is to happen shortly” regarding </p>
<p>eschatological events as such. Rather, the breaking of the seals paves the </p>
<p>way for what follows, but they are not themselves the major event(s).</p>
<p>Finally, everything narrated about the scroll in chapters 4 and 5 </p>
<p>points to its signicance in the unfolding drama: its being in God’s right </p>
<p>hand; its role in both the introduction of and praise to the Lamb; John’s </p>
<p>dramatic weeping. At stake, of course, is what has been narrated in the </p>
<p>letters to the seven churches, where there is constant warning of an im-</p>
<p>pending trial and the repeated promise that the faithful will be victors. </p>
<p>e drama itself will unfold with the opening of the seventh seal in 8:1. </p>
<p>So to heighten the drama, John has chosen to use the opening of the </p>
<p>seven seals as a means of communicating the reason for the (necessary) </p>
divine intervention that will come later. us the present material func-
<p>tions very much like the overture of an opera: all the major themes that </p>
<p>will appear in the opera are woven together into a (hopefully) captivat-</p>
<p>ing invitation to listen to the rest. So in this case all the major themes of </p>
the “divine drama” are here presented in a sequential way through the
<p>four horsemen, the martyrs, and nally the earthquake. e rest of the </p>
<p>book will provide the actual drama that spells out the story.</p>
