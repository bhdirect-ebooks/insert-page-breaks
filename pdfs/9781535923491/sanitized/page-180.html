<p>Revelation 11:15–19</p>
<p>158</p>
<p>elders, who were seated on the thrones before God, points to a kind </p>
<p>of consummation of things. From their seats “before God” they fell on </p>
<p>their faces and worshiped God, which that takes the form of thanks-</p>
<p>giving (v. 17a), now echoing language from the introduction of God in </p>
<p>the narrative in 1:8, and that aorded God in the heavenly scene in 4:8. </p>
<p>us the worship of “the twenty-four elders” (those who represent the </p>
<p>people of God from both covenants) begins, We give thanks to you, </p>
<p>Lord God Almighty, the one who is and who was. is is followed </p>
<p>immediately by the cause of the thanksgiving: because you have taken </p>
<p>your great power and have begun to reign. In some ways this a most </p>
<p>unusual thing to say of the God who never ceases to rule the universe </p>
<p>that God has created. But the emphasis here is eschatological, referring </p>
<p>the End when God once more brings all things visibly under his “great </p>
<p>p o w e r.”</p>
<p>But the rest of the thanksgiving of the twenty-four elders carries </p>
<p>some surprises, since it picks up on the dual nature of God’s eschato-</p>
<p>logical judgment of all peoples, and takes the form of a kind of A–B–A </p>
<p>arrangement. It begins with God’s judgment of the wicked: e nations </p>
<p>were angry,</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> and your wrath has come. In John’s Greek this is a delib-</p>
<p>erately two-sided moment, in which the biblical distinctions between </p>
<p>“anger” and “wrath” are maintained. “Anger” is what reects the charac-</p>
ter and activity of those who oppose God; “wrath” is the divine response
<p>to such anger that takes the form of nal judgment. us the time </p>
<p>has come for judging the dead; but in keeping with the Apocalypse </p>
<p>throughout, the rst to receive “judgment” are God’s own people, who </p>
<p>then take two forms. First, God’s judgment will include rewarding </p>
<p>your servants the prophets. is would seem to be a subtle hint to the </p>
reader as to John’s own place in the divine scheme of things. But his
<p>greater concern at this point in the narrative is in God’s “rewarding” </p>
<p>your people who revere your name. is is an especially biblical way </p>
<p>of referring to those who are faithful to Yahweh and to Christ. en, to </p>
<p>make sure that every reader/hearer in the seven churches is included, </p>
<p>he adds both great and small, echoing Psalm 115:13 in reverse, which </p>
<p>seems especially tting in a context where the “small”—the faithful who </p>
<p>are not conspicuous or in places of leadership—are an equal concern </p>
<p>for John along with God’s “servants the prophets.”</p>
<p>44. For this language see the LXX of Ps 2:1.</p>
