<p>e Sixth Trumpet [= the Second Woe]</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>who had been kept ready for this very hour and day and month </p>
<p>and year were released to kill a third of the world’s people. </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>e </p>
<p>number of the mounted troops was twice ten thousand times ten </p>
<p>thousand. I heard their number.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>e horses and riders I saw in my vision looked like this: </p>
<p>eir breastplates were ery red, dark blue, and yellow as sulfur. </p>
<p>e heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions, and out of </p>
<p>their mouths came re, smoke and sulfur. </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>A third of the people </p>
<p>were killed by the three plagues of re, smoke and sulfur that came </p>
<p>out of their mouths.</p>
<p> 19</p>
<p>e power of the horses was in their mouths </p>
<p>and in their tails; for their tails were like snakes, having heads </p>
<p>with which they inict injury.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>e rest of the people who were not killed by these plagues </p>
<p>still did not repent of the work of their hands; they did not stop </p>
<p>worshiping demons, and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone and </p>
<p>wood—idols that cannot see or hear or walk. </p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Nor did they re-</p>
<p>pent of their murders, their magic arts, their sexual immorality or </p>
<p>their thes.</p>
<p>With the sounding of the sixth trumpet everything heads toward what </p>
<p>C. S. Lewis called “the last battle.” us in keeping with the preceding </p>
<p>ve plagues, John presents yet another extraordinary picture, this time </p>
<p>of a cavalry of such monumental proportions that even the large Jezreel </p>
<p>Valley in northern Palestine could not contain them all. e picture </p>
<p>comes to us in three parts: the rst (vv. 13–16) signals the gathering </p>
<p>of “the mounted troops”; while the second (vv. 17–19) describes both </p>
<p>“the horses and [their] riders,” as well their devastation of a third of the </p>
<p>earth’s population; the nal part (vv. 20–21), a concluding summation, </p>
<p>indicates the resistance of those who survived the plague, and who thus </p>
<p>continued in their ungodly ways despite the warnings aorded by the </p>
<p>plague itself.</p>
Once more the reader is reminded of the divine sovereignty in all
<p>of this; that everything is ultimately initiated from the heavenly throne. </p>
<p>us when the sixth angel sounded his trumpet, there follows imme-</p>
<p>diately a voice coming from the four</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>horns of the golden altar that</p>
<p>is before God. is sentence reminds the reader that John is still in the </p>
<p>heavenly scene that began with his being “in the Spirit” and thus trans-</p>
15. e textual tradition of the Revelation is fairly evenly divided as to whether
<p>or not the adjective “four” is original here. It is included in most English translations, </p>
<p>omitted only in the REB, and put in brackets in the NAB. It was also omitted in the </p>
<p>original NIV, but considered authentic by the revision committee.</p>
