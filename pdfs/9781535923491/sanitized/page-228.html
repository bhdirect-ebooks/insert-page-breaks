<p>Revelation 14:17–20</p>
<p>206</p>
<p>Finally, with one of those elusive passives in this book, the reader is </p>
<p>told that they [the grapes] were trampled in the winepress outside the </p>
<p>city. Equally elusive, along with who did the trampling, is the question </p>
<p>of which city is now in view, or whether “the city” is merely part of the </p>
<p>overall imagery, since such wine trampling usually took place outside </p>
<p>any city. But in this case one is hard pressed not to imagine that the city </p>
<p>John had in mind was Rome itself—especially so in light of the specic </p>
<p>expressions of judgment that are to follow in chapters 15–18. And so </p>
<p>the gruesome nature of the judgment is expressed nally in terms of the </p>
<p>shedding of blood, which in this case is that of the Empire. eir blood </p>
<p>thus owed out of the press, and with such quantity that it rose as high </p>
<p>as the horse’s bridles for a distance of 1,600 stadia.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>is, of course,</p>
<p>is imagery, striking imagery, intended to express the enormity of God’s </p>
<p>judgment on Rome when it would nally take place. From this picture </p>
<p>John will turn immediately to the several expressions of judgment on </p>
<p>the Empire, imaged as “the great city.”</p>
<p>What we have, therefore, in the great narrative that began in chap-</p>
<p>ter 12 lies very much at the center of John’s overall story, and oers the </p>
<p>theological/prophetic heart of the matter. Central to everything in the </p>
<p>big picture for John is Christ and his defeat of Satan, both historically </p>
<p>through the resurrection and ultimately, at the End, through the resur-</p>
<p>rection of believers and the nal destruction of all that is evil. But those </p>
<p>who follow Christ, John warns, must do so indeed, which in their case </p>
<p>means that hard times lie just ahead. us even though God will nally </p>
<p>save his own and judge the enemy, the present and near future will </p>
<p>not be a bed of roses. In the meantime, therefore, God’s people in Asia </p>
<p>Minor must do three things: continue to bear witness to the nations; be </p>
<p>warned of the maddening adulteries of the enemy; and be prepared to </p>
<p>suer and die as part of their witness—all of which nds expression in </p>
<p>the narratives that follow.</p>
<p>e present passage, therefore, is best seen as an introduction to </p>
<p>the two major parts of the rest of the book, with the grain harvest com-</p>
<p>ing rst as an encouragement to God’s suering people, and thus an-</p>
<p>ticipating the narrative of 21:1—22:5, while the trampling of the grapes </p>
<p>anticipates what lies next in chapters 15–20.</p>
<p>6. For American readers, this comes to about 180 miles (300 kilometers for the </p>
<p>rest of the world).</p>
