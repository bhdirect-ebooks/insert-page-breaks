<p>Revelation 17:1–18</p>
<p>234</p>
<p>with the nest of jewels: gold, precious stones and pearls. As betting </p>
<p>royalty, she held a golden cup in her hand; but John will not let it rest </p>
<p>there, since even though the Empire may have considered itself as roy-</p>
<p>alty, its/her cup was lled with abominable things and the lth of her </p>
<p>adulteries. Even though from an outside view this may seem like “sour </p>
<p>grapes,” John is at this point speaking for the God of Israel, the Father </p>
<p>of the one true Lord, Jesus Christ. By now the luxurious and proigate </p>
<p>lifestyle of most of Rome’s powerful people had become infamous, and </p>
<p>now they were, as those of Babylon before her had likewise been, des-</p>
<p>tined for judgment.</p>
<p>erefore, in order to press the point home for his readers in the </p>
<p>seven churches, and to make sure that no one could mistake the identity </p>
<p>of the harlot, John pictures this name written on her forehead. us, </p>
<p>in the place where others had to bear “the mark of the beast” (13:16), </p>
<p>Rome itself is now marked by God as the mother of prostitutes and </p>
<p>of the abominations of the earth. For the sake of John’s readers these </p>
<p>words are preceded by the title rst introduced in 14:8, Babylon the </p>
<p>Great. And the title itself is preceded by the descriptor mystery. is </p>
<p>introductory word, of course, is intended to alert John’s readers not that </p>
<p>there is mystery in what follows, but that the names that follow are to be </p>
<p>understood as “cryptic.” Aer all, John is a prisoner of the Empire, and </p>
<p>is writing this book both about it and “under its eyes,” as it were.</p>
<p>But the woman is more than just a tart, she is also a sot, who had </p>
<p>made herself drunk, not with too much wine, but with the blood of </p>
<p>God’s people. us, in anticipation of what is to come for “the saints,” </p>
<p>Rome is here pictured as sotted from drinking the blood of those who </p>
<p>bore testimony to Jesus. Here again, in light of the (so far) singular </p>
<p>martyrdom of Antipas of Pergamum, John speaks prophetically of the </p>
<p>blood bath that Rome was about to unleash on the followers of Him </p>
<p>whom they had executed as a brigand, a rebel whose teaching and </p>
<p>followers had from their perspective threatened the Roman “pax” in </p>
<p>Judea. In order for John’s readers to have a sense of the awe such a sight </p>
<p>provoked in him, he concludes by noting his own great wonder at the </p>
<p>sight: When I saw her, I was greatly astonished.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>3. By including this nal sentence in the present discussion, I have chosen to go </p>
<p>along with the editors of the Greek New Testament, rather than the several English </p>
<p>translations, including the NIV and NRSV, which start the next paragraph here.</p>
