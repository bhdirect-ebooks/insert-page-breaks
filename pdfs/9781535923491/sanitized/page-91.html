understanding of divine matters; and also in keeping with this stance
<p>John can only describe his appearance in terms of precious stones: jas-</p>
<p>per and ruby. With this description John is again echoing some Old </p>
<p>Testament passages, in this case Exodus 28:17–20 and Ezekiel 1:26, </p>
<p>having to do with the breastplate of the high priest. It is probably sig-</p>
<p>nicant that in the Exodus passage these are the rst and last of the </p>
<p>twelve stones mentioned in the description, and that both of them are </p>
<p>red. At the same time, jasper in particular anticipates the nal visions in </p>
<p>chapters 21:1—22:5, where it is mentioned three times, as the primary </p>
<p>color of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>As John moves from “him who sits on the throne” to the other </p>
<p>features that magnify both the reality and the awe that surround the </p>
<p>eternal God, the rst thing up is a rainbow that shone like an emer-</p>
<p>ald, which encircled the throne. Again, this echoes the theophany in </p>
<p>Ezekiel 1:26, although the precious stone has been changed from a blue </p>
<p>lapis lazuli to an emerald, which is ordinarily green, but also is found in </p>
<p>shades of greenish blue.</p>
<p>e second feature surrounding the throne was a circle of twen-</p>
<p>ty-four other thrones, on which were seated . . . twenty-four elders. </p>
<p>is turns out to be one of the more complex images in the Revelation, </p>
<p>on which there is nothing close to consensus among scholars. e </p>
<p>complexities have to do with both their number and the various de-</p>
<p>scriptions of them throughout the book. e number itself is the easier </p>
<p>matter, since in the imagery of the New Jerusalem in chapter 21, the </p>
<p>twelve tribes of Israel are inscribed on the gates, and the twelve apostles </p>
<p>of the Lamb on the foundations. Moreover, in 1 Chronicles 24:3–19 </p>
David divided the leaders of worshiping priests into twenty-four divi-
<p>sions, whose purpose was to minister in the temple. Since the primary </p>
<p>task of the elders in the Revelation is to worship God and the Lamb, this </p>
<p>combination of the twelve tribes of Israel with the twelve who were with </p>
<p>Jesus is most likely what lies behind the present description.</p>
<p>Our basic diculties arise from the description of them as dressed </p>
<p>in white, with crowns of gold on their heads, and the fact that they </p>
<p>are on “twenty-four other thrones” that surround the central throne. </p>
<p>Since these phrases carry echoes from the depictions of “those who </p>
<p>are victorious” in chapters 2 and 3, one’s rst instinct is to see them </p>
<p>as human beings now in the Divine Presence. In fact, this is almost </p>
<p>certainly how they are to be understood, even though throughout the </p>
