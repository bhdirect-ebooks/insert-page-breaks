<p>Revelation 3:7–13</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>literally—and forcefully for the Philadelphians—“and outside they will </p>
<p>never go out.” us for those who have had to abandon their town once </p>
<p>and again, and for the many who had chosen to live outside the town in </p>
<p>any case, this promise had very direct bearing.</p>
As the ultimate sign of divine ownership, these believers are also
<p>promised that I [Christ] will write on them the name of my God and </p>
<p>the name of the city of my God. Writing God’s name on them antici-</p>
<p>pates both the negative and positive forehead inscriptions found later </p>
<p>in the book. In chapter 13 the beast will require his own name to be </p>
<p>written on the forehead and the right hand, as evidence of enslavement; </p>
<p>but in chapter 20:4 those who do not have his name written on the </p>
<p>forehead, and thus are assumed to have God’s name written there, are </p>
<p>given the privilege of enjoying the millennial reign with Christ. e </p>
<p>“city” here, of course, is none other than the new Jerusalem, which is </p>
<p>later seen as coming down out of heaven from my God. us these </p>
<p>believers in earthquake-prone Philadelphia will inherit a city that will </p>
<p>endure—and will exist without the tremors!</p>
<p>e nal promise is the most signicant of all: I will also write </p>
<p>on them my new name. Two matters need comment here. First, the </p>
<p>writing of Christ’s name on their foreheads is the ultimate sign of own-</p>
<p>ership, but an ownership not of enslavement but of ultimate and glori-</p>
<p>ous freedom. Second, the “new name” is almost certainly an intentional </p>
<p>foreshadowing of the vision in 19:11–21, where Christ the heavenly </p>
<p>warrior defeats and thus destroys the beast. ere Christ’s “new name” </p>
<p>is “King of kings and Lord of lords”; and now in anticipation of that </p>
<p>scene the victors in Philadelphia are promised to have that name writ-</p>
<p>ten on them as well (but with location unmentioned, since it is a name </p>
of divine ownership, not of personal gain).
<p>To the Church in Laodicea (3:14–22)</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>“To the angel of the church in Laodicea write:</p>
<p>ese are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true wit-</p>
<p>ness, the ruler of God’s creation. </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>I know your deeds, that you are </p>
<p>neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>So, </p>
<p>because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to </p>
<p>spit you out of my mouth. </p>
<p>17</p>
<p>You say, ‘I am rich; I have acquired </p>
<p>wealth and do not need a thing.’ But you do not realize that you </p>
