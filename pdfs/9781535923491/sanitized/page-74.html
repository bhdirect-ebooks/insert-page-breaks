<p>Revelation 3:7–13</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>e words to the church begin (for the fourth of ve times in these </p>
<p>letters) with the armation I know your deeds. But what follows is </p>
<p>unique to the seven letters, in that praise for the present and promises for </p>
<p>the future are intertwined. Philadelphia is also one of the two churches </p>
<p>(along with Smyrna) that receive no critique of any kind. e result is </p>
<p>that praise and promise are uniquely blended, in a letter with only one </p>
<p>imperative: “hold on to what you have” (v. 11b). e praise comes in </p>
<p>two forms: in verse 8b Christ commends them because even though </p>
<p>you have little strength,</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>you have in fact kept my word and have not</p>
<p>denied my name; and in verse 10a they are commended because you </p>
<p>have kept my command to endure patiently. Noticeably, these twofold </p>
<p>words of praise say basically the same thing: that these believers have </p>
<p>been loyal to the gospel even in the midst of severe persecution. In the </p>
<p>rst instance their loyalty is described on its negative side, in terms of </p>
<p>their refusing to deny Christ’s name.</p>
<p>Another of the puzzles for later readers of this letter is the mean-</p>
<p>ing of, and the historical reason for, their having “little strength.” e </p>
<p>probable best guess is to see it as related to the Jewish community men-</p>
<p>tioned in verse 9, whose future is noted but whose specic faults are </p>
<p>not, except to deny that they are true “Jews” (see the further discussion </p>
<p>below). e meaning of “kept my word” is likewise not immediately </p>
<p>clear. Does “word” mean a specic prophetic word to this church, or, </p>
<p>perhaps more likely, does it represent the many words of Christ that are </p>
<p>known and kept alive in this community? In either case, the emphasis </p>
<p>in the commendation probably lies with their abiding faithfulness to </p>
<p>the gospel message itself.</p>
<p>e second commendation, about keeping his “command to en-</p>
<p>dure patiently” (v. 10a), is easy enough to understand as such; what is </p>
<p>not known are the historical circumstances of the church that would </p>
<p>have called for such a commendation. And here again is a place where </p>
<p>speculation serves little or no purpose so as to further one’s understand-</p>
<p>ing. What is perhaps worthy of note is that this is the third and nal </p>
<p>occurrence in these letters of the word rendered “endure.”</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>Whereas</p>
<p>three occurrences might seem considerable under ordinary circum-</p>
<p>24. One wonders whether this is intended as a kind of word play, reecting the </p>
<p>reality of the city itself.</p>
<p>25. See above on 2:2–3 and 2:18; its only other occurrences are in 1:9 above (q.v.) </p>
<p>and 14:12.</p>
