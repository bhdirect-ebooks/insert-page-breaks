<p>Revelation 8:6–13</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>It should be further noted that in the prophetic tradition temporal pun-</p>
<p>ishment, not nal judgment and death, is the goal of such extraordinary </p>
<p>phenomena. e same holds true for John in the present passage, since </p>
<p>throughout these preliminary visions John perceives these expressions </p>
of divine displeasure as leaving the door open for the possibility of
<p>repentance.</p>
<p>John then concludes this series of woes, and introduces the nal </p>
<p>set of three, by means of the cry of a bird. In the Greek this bird is des-</p>
<p>ignated an aetos, a word that refers either to an eagle or a vulture, both </p>
<p>of which are carrion-eating birds, and thus unclean to the Jewish com-</p>
<p>munity. e intent of the bird’s cry is to set o the next two and the nal </p>
<p>angelic trumpets from these rst four. us John relates, as I watched, I </p>
<p>heard an eagle</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>that was ying in midair call out in a loud voice. e</p>
<p>sense of foreboding thus comes from an unclean bird, whose threefold </p>
<p>Woe! introduces a message of anticipated doom upon the inhabitants </p>
<p>of the earth. is doom will be announced through the trumpet blasts </p>
<p>about to be sounded by the other three angels. At the same time this </p>
<p>becomes a new structural signal—regarding the nal three woes—that </p>
<p>will be picked up further in 9:12 and 11:14.</p>
<p>The Fifth Trumpet [= the First Woe] (9:1–12)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>e h angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had </p>
<p>fallen from the sky to the earth. e star was given the key to the </p>
<p>sha of the Abyss. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from </p>
<p>it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace. e sun and sky were </p>
<p>darkened by the smoke from the Abyss. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>And out of the smoke </p>
<p>locusts came down on the earth and were given power like that </p>
<p>of scorpions of the earth. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>ey were told not to harm the grass of </p>
<p>the earth or any plant or tree, but only those people who did not </p>
<p>have the seal of God on their foreheads. </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>ey were not allowed to </p>
<p>kill them but only to torture them for ve months. And the agony </p>
<p>they suered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>During those days people will seek death but will not nd it; they </p>
<p>will long to die, but death will elude them.</p>
<p>6. Unfortunately most American readers, for whom the eagle is a national emblem, </p>
<p>miss the essentially pejorative nature of this picture. is is a symbol of death and </p>
<p>doom, with a hungry scavenger ying overhead, not that of a majestic creature being </p>
used for divine purposes.
