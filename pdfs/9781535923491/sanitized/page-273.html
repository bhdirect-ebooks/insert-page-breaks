<p>e Fall of Babylon the Great</p>
<p>251</p>
<p>of Israel. Here is God’s own response to the harlot and her ways, de-</p>
<p>picted so vividly in chapter 17.</p>
<p>e most striking feature in this litany is both the length and the </p>
<p>nature of the specics of the second lament, that of “the merchants of </p>
<p>the earth,” at which point John steps into his role as a true prophet. us </p>
<p>in keeping with the Old Testament prophetic tradition through whom </p>
<p>the God of Israel “pled the cause of the poor and needy,” John focuses al-</p>
<p>together on those who ply the trades of luxury, including those involved </p>
<p>in the horrors of slave tracking. Here God’s judgment is spelled out </p>
<p>by way of an unusually long listing of their wares, twenty-eight in all, </p>
<p>which come from every corner of the Empire’s vast domain. Indeed, </p>
<p>only one item on the list, olive oil, is a local product, but by the time of </p>
<p>John’s writing it also had to be imported in large quantities. Perhaps as </p>
<p>striking as anything, however, is the breadth of John’s own knowledge </p>
<p>of this dimension of the Empire’s high-handed treatment of those it </p>
<p>had conquered. One does not need a great imagination at this point to </p>
<p>hear echoes of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Amos, among the more noted of </p>
<p>the Prophets who, preceding John, likewise advanced the cause of God’s </p>
<p>special people, the “poor and needy.”</p>
<p>e First Woe: e Kings of the Earth (18:9–10)</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>“When the kings of the earth who committed adultery with her </p>
<p>and shared her luxury see the smoke of her burning, they will weep </p>
<p>and mourn over her. </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Terried at her torment, they will stand </p>
<p>far o and cry:</p>
<p>“‘Woe! Woe to you, great city,</p>
<p>You mighty city of Babylon!</p>
<p>In one hour your doom has come!’</p>
<p>e rst who weep over the demise of “the Eternal City”</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>are the petty</p>
<p>kings, who rst appear in the book as those over whom Christ rules </p>
<p>(1:5), but whose own rst signicant appearance took place in the pre-</p>
<p>ceding chapter, as in deep alliance (= dalliance) with the Scarlet Woman </p>
<p>herself. But John recognizes them for who they really are, toadies who </p>
<p>are both subordinate to the Empire and have almost no authority on </p>
<p>14. It is easy to see how this nickname arose; but it is especially dicult to trace its </p>
<p>origins, which are probably later than the time of John’s writing.</p>
