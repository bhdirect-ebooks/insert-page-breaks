<p>What one must understand before reading John’s Revelation is </p>
<p>that he has purposely set out to write something that has not been </p>
<p>done before, something that he sets up his readers to understand at </p>
<p>the very beginning. us in 1:1 he identies what he is about to write </p>
<p>as an apocalypse, translated “revelation” in the NIV, which in 1:3 he </p>
<p>refers to as a prophecy. But in the next two verses he begins again with </p>
<p>all the formal aspects of an ancient letter. So the reader is given these </p>
<p>three dierent pieces of information at the outset. What is unique about </p>
<p>John’s Apocalypse is the ne blending of each of these three kinds of </p>
<p>literature—apocalypse, prophecy, letter—into a single whole piece.</p>
<p>We begin, then, with the Revelation as an apocalypse, a word </p>
<p>used to describe a kind of literature that ourished rst among Jews </p>
<p>and then Christians for roughly the four-hundred-year period between </p>
<p>200 BCE and 200 CE, although its roots lie much earlier. e taproot </p>
<p>of apocalyptic was deeply embedded in the Old Testament Prophets, </p>
<p>which means that whatever else, these writers, including John, were </p>
<p>concerned about judgment and salvation. But the prophets, in contrast </p>
<p>to the apocalyptists, were not primarily writers. Rather, they were rst </p>
<p>of all spokespersons for Yahweh, who only later set their spoken words </p>
<p>to writing. e apocalypses, on the other hand, are carefully structured </p>
<p>and worked out literary works from the start. Part of the reason for this </p>
<p>is that apocalyptic was born during the time of powerful world em-</p>
<p>pires, which was oen a time of persecution for the Jewish community. </p>
<p>ese writers, therefore, were engaged in a kind of subversive literature, </p>
<p>prophesying cataclysmic judgments on their persecutors—God’s own </p>
<p>enemies—who at the time of writing appeared so powerful that there </p>
was no hope for their collapse except by divine intervention. us these
<p>writers no longer looked for God to bring about their redemption within </p>
<p>history; rather, they pictured God as bringing a cataclysmic end to his-</p>
<p>tory, which also ushered in a redemptive conclusion for God’s people.</p>
<p>e substance of apocalyptic included several recognizable liter-</p>
<p>ary devices. First, regarding their form, the apocalyptists were record-</p>
<p>ing visions and dreams. Whether or not there were actual experiences </p>
<p>of dreams simply cannot be known. Second, their language, especially </p>
<p>their imagery, was deliberately cryptic and symbolic. us, for example, </p>
<p>the apocalyptist “sees” a woman clothed with the sun; and whereas one </p>
<p>understands both a “woman” and the “sun,” the combination is not an </p>
<p>expression of any known reality. Similarly, the apocalyptist sees a beast </p>
