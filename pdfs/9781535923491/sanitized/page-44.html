<p>The Letters to the Seven Churches</p>
<p>With the seven letters that make up chapters 2 and 3 of the Revelation, </p>
<p>one turns from the glories of the introductory materials—the saluta-</p>
<p>tion, doxology, opening vision of Christ, and commission of John—to </p>
<p>the actual situation of the churches themselves. How much grander </p>
<p>it would have been for John to have gone immediately from 1:20 to </p>
<p>4:1! But that would be to miss too much in terms of the point of the </p>
<p>book, which was, aer all, written to these seven specic churches. In </p>
<p>the opening vision Christ appears as standing among them, and John’s </p>
<p>commission to write to them was intended in part to do with “what is </p>
<p>now” (1:19). In fact what is said here (chs. 2–3) helps to make sense </p>
<p>both of the book as a whole and of the preceding commission to John in </p>
1:19 in particular. Whatever else may be true of these individual letters,
<p>as a group they let his rst readers in on one dimension of “what is”; </p>
<p>namely the condition of the church(es), which lls John with concern.</p>
Before one considers each church individually, however, it is im-
<p>portant to note that all the believers who are to receive this document </p>
<p>end up reading every one else’s mail, as it were—a sure indication that </p>
the individual Christian communities still did not think of themselves
<p>in isolated terms, but as all belonging to the same larger reality. is is </p>
<p>obviously purposeful on John’s part, since these churches are related </p>
<p>geographically and each needs to know how the Lord feels about the </p>
<p>others. us, the living Christ—the One who walks in the midst of the </p>
lampstands—addresses each of the churches individually, but he also
<p>expects each to take heed to what he says to the others by way of the </p>
<p>encouragements and warnings that follow. Aer all, each letter con-</p>
<p>cludes with the words, “what the Spirit says to the churches.” is reality </p>
<p>probably says something about the unity of the early church, which is </p>
<p>basically unknown to the church(es) of later centuries.</p>
