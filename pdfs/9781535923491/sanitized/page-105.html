<p>e Lamb Takes the Scroll and Heaven Rejoices</p>

<p>e four living creatures said, “Amen,” and the elders fell down </p>
<p>and worshiped.</p>
<p>In terms of the narrative itself this nal scene in the drama of heaven </p>
<p>is simply a continuation of the preceding one, and in fact almost all </p>
<p>English translations (rightly) include verse 7 as a part of verse 6. e </p>
<p>present choice to start the nal scene with verse 7 is to highlight the fact </p>
<p>that the action narrated here is what actually initiates the progression of </p>
<p>worship that constitutes the rest of the narrative. Moreover, in the pres-</p>
<p>ent scene the reader continues to be held in suspense regarding what is </p>
<p>to follow, as the heavenly choirs, with increasing crescendo, celebrate </p>
<p>the presence of the slain, now risen Lamb in the heavenly court. us </p>
<p>the singing is begun by “the four living creatures and the twenty-four </p>
<p>elders.” It is then picked up by the innumerable host of heaven, who in </p>
<p>verse 12 echo the song previously sung to God the Father in 4:11. And </p>
<p>nally, the whole created order, both heaven and earth, sing a conclud-</p>
<p>ing doxology to both the Father and the Son (v. 13), which in turn is </p>
<p>armed (now in reverse order) by the four living creatures and the </p>
<p>twenty-four elders.</p>
<p>ese are the kinds of moments that should give any interpreter </p>
<p>reason for pause, since these words hardly need commentary, but rather </p>
<p>armation and acclamation. Readers of this passage who themselves </p>
<p>fail to join in with the heavenly host are listening to the text only cere-</p>
<p>brally, and not with the exhilaration intended by John, so that his read-</p>
<p>ers are themselves drawn into the heavenly scene as part of the worship. </p>
<p>Indeed the reader who fails in the present to enter into the heavenly </p>
<p>worship, which for them is still to come, will have missed John’s pur-</p>
<p>pose by several leagues. John’s original readers may indeed be excused </p>
<p>if they held back in joining the worship noted in our chapter 4, but they </p>
<p>will have little excuse for holding back here. Whatever may be the pres-</p>
<p>ent circumstances in the seven churches immediately in purview, here </p>
<p>they are being drawn to join in the worship being described.</p>
<p>e celebration thus begins when the Lamb went and took the </p>
<p>scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne, the past </p>
<p>tense here continuing from its rst appearance in verse 1. And with this </p>
<p>the drums begin to roll, as it were, as the next stages of the drama are </p>
<p>thus set in motion. But the scroll itself is not opened until the beginning </p>
<p>of our chapter 8, and even then the contents are not specically noted </p>
