<p>in Mediterranean and Near Eastern lands. Here John has moved subtly </p>
<p>from a description of locusts to something much more human in ap-</p>
<p>pearance. at this is his intent is made certain by the next descriptor: </p>
<p>their faces resembled human faces, “resembled” in this case because </p>
<p>“human faces” (= human beings) is in fact what John is setting out to </p>
<p>depict.</p>
<p>is imagery is then heightened by their next feature; as long-</p>
<p>haired barbarians, their hair was like women’s hair. Staying with the </p>
<p>head, John next caricatures the barbarians’ mouths in terms of their </p>
<p>sometimes fearsome-appearing teeth. us their teeth were like lions’ </p>
<p>teeth, imagery that may also have resulted from their (known or sup-</p>
<p>posed) love of meat, especially meat on the bone. At the same time, of </p>
<p>course, teeth are the “weapon” of actual locusts, whose ability to devour </p>
<p>created such dreaded havoc on crops and people alike. e next descrip-</p>
<p>tor might appear to be the more puzzling one; but if in fact this is an </p>
<p>attempt to describe the barbarians guratively, then breastplates like </p>
<p>breastplates of iron is a descriptor based on the underside of the locust </p>
<p>while it also describes the appearance of the multitudes of real breast-</p>
<p>plates in an army arrayed for battle. Very likely this imagery is what </p>
<p>brought about the prophet Joel’s description in the rst place, which </p>
<p>John is now picking up. e next item is also not terribly complicated: </p>
<p>the sound of their wings is described as like the thundering of many </p>
<p>horses and chariots rushing into battle. Again, this is a depiction that </p>
<p>moves easily from imagery to reality and back again. e sound of such </p>
<p>hordes is what holds the imagery and the reality together, and allows </p>
<p>the reader to have a considerable amount of condence as to what John </p>
<p>is doing.</p>
<p>Finally, John concludes his depiction of the feared barbarian </p>
<p>hordes by returning to the imagery with which he began. e locusts, </p>
<p>even though they “looked like horses prepared for battle” (v. 7), are </p>
<p>once more likened to scorpions. But here the mixing of metaphors </p>
<p>takes over the description itself. At the beginning (v. 3) John has already </p>
<p>described the locusts as having been “given power like that of scorpions </p>
<p>of the earth,” who were to “torture [people] for ve months.” Now in </p>
<p>the nal clause of the long description of the locusts/barbarians (v. 10), </p>
<p>he returns to this imagery by giving them tails like stingers, like scor-</p>
<p>pions, who as before had power to torment people for ve months. </p>
