<p>Introduction</p>
<p>xx</p>
<p>The Revelation: When Was It Written?</p>
<p>In many ways this should be the easiest to answer of the several ques-</p>
<p>tions of introduction, since almost everything in the book suggests a </p>
<p>period somewhere around the turn of the second Christian century: </p>
<p>the conditions of the churches in chapters 2 and 3; the fact that there </p>
<p>has already been a martyrdom; and most of all, the clear and unrelent-</p>
<p>ing tension between church and state that dominates the book, which </p>
<p>did not occur in Asia Minor until this time. Granted that Nero had </p>
<p>ordered the death of believers in Rome at an earlier time (using them </p>
<p>as living torches for his infamous garden parties), but what is going on </p>
<p>this book is much more universal and is about to aect the churches </p>
<p>located in Asia Minor. e only piece of evidence that would suggest an </p>
<p>earlier date is the matter of the “counting” of the emperors in chapter </p>
<p>17; but this is hardly enough on which to base the dating of the entire </p>
<p>document, since, as is pointed out in the commentary, this is a highly </p>
<p>dubious matter in terms of precision. In any case, a late rst- or early </p>
<p>second-century date is assumed throughout this commentary, and is </p>
<p>the perspective from which all of its data are presented and understood.</p>
<p>Some Concluding Words about Interpretation</p>
<p>In my classes over the years when teaching this great book, I make a </p>
<p>nal plea in the opening lecture regarding the necessity of exegesis as </p>
<p>the proper way—indeed the only way—that leads to understanding. It </p>
<p>may seems strange that one should have to make this plea at all for the </p>
<p>reading or studying of a biblical book, but it has been necessary be-</p>
<p>cause many of my students have had to shed some lamentable readings </p>
<p>they have brought to the text. e unfortunate reality is that almost all </p>
<p>of the popular stu written on the Revelation, which tends to be well </p>
<p>known by many of these students, has scarcely a shred of exegetical </p>
<p>basis to it. Such interpreters usually begin with a previously worked </p>
<p>out eschatological scheme that they bring to the text, a scheme into </p>
<p>which they then spend an extraordinary amount of energy trying to </p>
<p>make everything in the text t, and which they then attempt to defend, </p>
<p>but with very little success.</p>
<p>So rule number one is that which the reader should bring to all the </p>
<p>biblical documents, especially the Epistles, namely, that the interpreter’s </p>
