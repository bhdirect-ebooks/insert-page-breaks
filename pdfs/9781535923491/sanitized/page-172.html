<p>Revelation 11:1–14</p>
<p>150</p>
<p>equipped to prophesy during the whole “42 months” that the outer </p>
<p>court is given over to the Gentiles. On the premise consistently pursued </p>
<p>in this commentary, that one begins interpretation with what seems </p>
<p>certain, we must assume that the two witnesses represent Christian </p>
<p>believers in some way. is is made clear in verse 8, where John says </p>
<p>“their Lord” had been “crucied,” language that distinguishes Christian </p>
<p>believers from all other people on the earth. is is further conrmed </p>
<p>by the fact that they both “witness” and “prophesy,” which are the very </p>
<p>activities of John himself; furthermore, “witness” in the Revelation </p>
<p>refers specically to someone’s bearing witness to Jesus, sometimes </p>
<p>through death itself.</p>
<p>John’s initial description of them, they are the two olive trees, is </p>
<p>drawn directly from Zechariah 4:3, where the prophet saw two olive </p>
<p>trees on either side of a seven-lamp menorah. Zechariah’s prophecy was </p>
<p>intended to encourage Zerubabbel (the king) and Joshua (the priest) to </p>
<p>rebuild the temple in Jerusalem by the help of the Spirit. In John’s vision </p>
<p>the “two witnesses” next assume the role of the two lampstands, who </p>
<p>are further described in the language of Zechariah 4:14: they stand </p>
<p>before the Lord of the earth. Most likely the “two witnesses” serve as </p>
<p>imagery for the people of God worldwide, who in 5:9–10 have been </p>
<p>purchased by the Lamb to become a kingship and priests for God and </p>
<p>who are destined “to reign on the earth.” Now clothed in sackcloth (v. </p>
<p>3), the “two witnesses” must prophesy by bearing witness to the Lamb, </p>
<p>their Lord who had been crucied in the same “city” where they now </p>
<p>bear witness. And John now plays the role of Zechariah, who is here </p>
<p>encouraging “the two olive trees” (his contemporary church) to carry </p>
<p>on their task in the midst of present, increasing diculties.</p>
<p>e next part of the vision oers a twofold armation of their </p>
<p>witness. First (v. 5), John assures his contemporary church of God’s </p>
<p>sovereign protection over them if anyone tries to harm them as they </p>
<p>bear witness to Christ. Picking up the imagery of the apocalyptic horses </p>
<p>from 9:17, John now pictures God’s people themselves as having re that </p>
<p>comes out of their mouths and devours their enemies. It is doubtful </p>
<p>whether John here actually intended something like “tit for tat”; rather </p>
<p>this is most likely intentionally strong imagery</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>to indicate that during</p>
<p>the time of their witness God will protect them so that they may fulll </p>
<p>36. With an echo of Jer 5:14: “I will make my words in your mouth a re and these </p>
<p>people the wood it consumes.”</p>
