<p>e Seventh Seal: Prelude to the Seven Trumpets</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>a scene that can be easily envisioned, the fact is that a heavenly “altar” is </p>
<p>here introduced for the rst time, even though it is referred to as some-</p>
<p>thing that the reader should recognize. e reason for introducing it, </p>
<p>of course, is related to the rest of the scene that follows, whose imagery </p>
<p>will only work with the assumption of an altar.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>e incense with its accompanying prayers then went up before </p>
<p>God from the angel’s hand—an unusual moment to be sure, where </p>
<p>an angel rather than a human priest is the heavenly ociant. is in </p>
<p>turn is followed by the initial heavenly response, which is performed </p>
<p>by the same angel, who then took the censer, lled it with re from </p>
<p>the alter, and hurled it on the earth. is combination seems quite </p>
<p>intentional on John’s part; that is, in the ow of the present narrative </p>
<p>one should assume that the same “golden censer” in verse 3, which was </p>
<p>associated with incense and “the prayers of God’s people,” is here “lled </p>
. . . with re . . . and hurled . . . on the earth” as the divine response to
<p>the prayers. e response in turn to the censer being throw down is a </p>
<p>theophanic display in the form of peals of thunder, rumblings, ashes </p>
<p>of lightning and an earthquake (cf. 4:5).</p>
<p>What this means seems clear enough, and serves as the source of </p>
<p>the title of Eugene Peterson’s meditative commentary on the Revelation, </p>
<p>Reversed under, language borrowed from George Herbert. Earlier </p>
<p>in 6:9–10, the souls of the “saints” are under the altar, where they cry </p>
<p>out, “How long, Sovereign Lord, until you . . . avenge our blood?” Now, </p>
<p>in another great moment in this book, this initial picture of warnings </p>
<p>about soon-coming judgment is seen as in direct response to the prayers </p>
<p>of the saints. us, as the prayers go up, great displays of a erce storm </p>
<p>come down, which conclude with a rumbling of the earth itself.</p>
<p>The First Four Trumpets and the First Eagle (8:6–13)</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>en the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to </p>
<p>sound them.</p>
<p>with linguistic baggage that imply a special group of believers among the much larger </p>
<p>group as a whole. More technically the term suggests “those who have been set apart </p>
<p>and sanctied” to serve God wholly, which is what all believers are intended to be and </p>
<p>do. us John’s language here is intended not only to identify those who truly belong </p>
<p>to God, but also to describe how they are to live—in loving obedience to their heavenly </p>
<p>Father, whose likeness they are also to bear.</p>
<p>2. For the next mention of the altar, see on 9:13 below.</p>
