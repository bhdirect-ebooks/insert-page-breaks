<p>But the prophetic word of this book is also one of encouragement, </p>
<p>as John repeatedly announces that God, not the Empire, is in control of </p>
<p>history; that the church will triumph even through death; that God will </p>
<p>nally bring justice and pour out his wrath on the persecutor; and that </p>
<p>at the end God will bring eternal rest to the faithful.</p>
<p>A nal note in this regard: it is imperative that the reader note </p>
<p>the clear distinction John makes between two crucial words (and thus </p>
<p>ideas): thlipsis (tribulation) and orgē (wrath). Tribulation, including </p>
<p>suering and death, is clearly part of what the church was already en-</p>
<p>during; John’s primary prophetic word is that noted above, that such </p>
<p>tribulation will get far worse before it ever gets better, that such suer-</p>
<p>ing and death are going to come in even greater measure before the End </p>
<p>itself. Misunderstanding the meaning of this word accounts for most of </p>
<p>the poor reading of this document. But John’s second prophetic word </p>
sets the former in divine perspective; God’s wrath (i.e., his judgments)
<p>will nally be poured out on those responsible for the suering—and </p>
<p>on all others who join in the rebellion against God and the Lamb, a view </p>
<p>that is wholly consonant with the rest of the New Testament.</p>

<p>The Revelation: Who Wrote It?</p>
<p>e authorship of the Apocalypse is complicated by its relationship with </p>
<p>the Fourth Gospel and the three epistles that bear the name of John, </p>
<p>even though all of these, as with the three Synoptic Gospels, actually </p>
<p>come to us without naming the author. By way of contrast, the author </p>
<p>of this book identies himself simply as “John.” At issue for later read-</p>
<p>ers is, which John? e primary answer to this is, a John well known to </p>
<p>his readers, a person who obviously held a place of some importance </p>
<p>among them—which may be attributed either to age or position, or as </p>
<p>is most likely, to both. At this point, as with the Gospels, we are thrown </p>
<p>back on what has been said by other early Christians, all of whom held </p>
<p>the author of the Fourth Gospel and the three Johannine Epistles to be </p>
<p>the Apostle John (the author calls himself “the elder” in 1 and 2 John). </p>
<p>e majority of these early writers also considered him to have been </p>
<p>the author of the Revelation; those few who thought otherwise did so </p>
<p>for spurious reasons—they believed that the Apostle John wrote the </p>
<p>3. As 2 ess 1:3–10 also makes clear.</p>
