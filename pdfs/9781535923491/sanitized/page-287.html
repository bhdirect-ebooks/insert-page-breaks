<p>e Fall of Babylon the Great</p>
<p>265</p>
<p>Rome’s idolatries—her religious adulteries—and anticipates the com-</p>
<p>ing bloodbath of believers in Christ. us God has avenged on her the </p>
<p>blood of his servants. With these nal two lines John in eect replays </p>
<p>the content of chapters 13 and 18.</p>
<p>e second hallelujah shouted by the same “great multitude in </p>
<p>heaven” oers clear evidence of John’s own literary skill, since in eect it </p>
<p>advances the content of the rst one only briey, and slightly, by means </p>
<p>of the imagery of re: e smoke from her goes up for ever and ever. </p>
<p>In so doing John thus picks up his own imagery regarding the judgment </p>
<p>of Rome to be carried out by “the beast and ten horns” in 17:16, who will </p>
<p>“eat her esh and burn her with re.” e erceness of this judgment is </p>
<p>expressed by the eternal nature of Rome’s burning—“for ever and ever.” </p>
<p>is in turn also anticipates the nal judgments in 20:7–15 of Satan and </p>
<p>those “whose names were not found written in the book of life.” So once </p>
<p>more John is following in Israel’s prophetic tradition, where temporal </p>
<p>realities (in this case, the sacking and burning of Rome) are expressed </p>
<p>in the language of eternal realities: “smoke” that ascends heavenward </p>
<p>“for ever and ever.”</p>
<p>What follows next, however, is not the third and nal “hallelujah,” </p>
<p>for which one must wait until verse 6, but a very brief interlude of rejoic-</p>
<p>ing and armation in heaven itself. us the two groups who populate </p>
<p>heaven, and who made their rst appearance in 4:4–6, the twenty-four </p>
<p>elders and the four living creatures, are presented once more in the </p>
<p>context of worship. However, in contrast to their rst appearance, </p>
<p>where only the “twenty-four elders” fell down before the throne and </p>
<p>worshiped, in the present scene both groups fell down and worshiped. </p>
<p>Equally striking in the present scene is the fact that the One worshiped </p>
<p>is no longer referred to as “Him who sits on the throne” but is now </p>
<p>identied directly as God, who was seated on the throne. eir only </p>
<p>role in the present scene, however, is something of a cameo appearance, </p>
<p>in which they arm the praise of the multitude that has preceded them </p>
<p>by crying out, Amen, Hallelujah!</p>
<p>At this point toward the end of the book, John pictures all creatures </p>
<p>in heaven and on earth as joining in the worship of God, a concern that </p>
<p>is then intensied by a responding voice that came from the throne. </p>
<p>But at this point John leaves the reader simply to ponder as to the iden-</p>
<p>tity of the speaker. e content of what is said eliminates the possibility </p>
<p>that it is God who speaks, since the aim of the “voice” is to call on the </p>
