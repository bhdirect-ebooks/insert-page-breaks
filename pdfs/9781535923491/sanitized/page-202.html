<p>sea and his le foot on the land,” indicating that despite all present ap-</p>
<p>pearances, both land and sea belong ultimately to God, not to Satan and </p>
<p>the Empire. e description that follows is in two parts. In verses 1–4, </p>
<p>John describes the beast itself and its relationship to the dragon, and </p>
<p>concludes with people’s response. In the second part (vv. 5–8), he goes </p>
<p>on to describe the beast’s activities, and again concludes with people’s </p>
<p>response. But in this latter case John concludes the whole vision with a </p>
<p>warning and exhortation to the people of God (vv. 9–10).</p>
<p>e actual description of the beast tends to defy one’s imagina-</p>
<p>tion, mostly because John is borrowing directly from Daniel 7, putting </p>
<p>on it the stamp of his own historical situation. us even though one </p>
<p>can imagine a beast with seven heads, that in fact is not what is rst </p>
<p>up. Rather, John begins with the fact that it had ten horns, and fur-</p>
<p>ther notes that it had ten crowns on its horns, meaning of course that </p>
<p>each of the ten horns had a crown on it. He then returns to the seven </p>
<p>heads, on each of which was inscribed a blasphemous name. Whether </p>
<p>John had specic names in mind by this designation or whether this is </p>
<p>merely apocalyptic description cannot be known from our distance; but </p>
<p>there can be little question that he is here describing the city of Rome, </p>
<p>set on seven hills as it was. But the ten horns are a bit more problem-</p>
<p>atic; in 17:12 they are specically identied as “ten kings who have not </p>
<p>yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as </p>
<p>kings along with the beast.” However one is to understand this in terms </p>
<p>either of specics or of how it nally played out in history, John is most </p>
<p>likely here referring to a large group of petty “kings,” such as the Herods </p>
<p>in Palestine, whose “kingship” would be altogether dependent on their </p>
<p>playing the Empire’s game—although the picture in chapter 17 refers to </p>
<p>them as “ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom.”</p>
<p>e actual description of the beast occurs in verse 2, where John is </p>
<p>drawing heavily from the several beasts in Daniel 7:5–7 but putting his </p>
<p>own twist on things. As with Daniel’s third beast, this one resembled a </p>
<p>leopard; like the second one, it had feet like those of a bear; and like </p>
<p>the rst one, it had a mouth like that of a lion. Even though there is </p>
<p>some debate as to Daniel’s intent regarding his fourth beast, there can </p>
<p>be little question here. Rome has assumed the power of all the preced-</p>
<p>ing empires, and that because the dragon gave the beast his power and </p>
<p>his throne and great authority. us from John’s perspective at the </p>
