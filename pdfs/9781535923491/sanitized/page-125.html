<p>Fusing the Horizons: Getting One’s Priorities in Order</p>

<p>severe it may turn out to be, “God is the Master yet.” The earth and all that </p>
<p>is in it are still God’s work and God’s love.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, John’s present concern in chapter 6, given the world’s </p>
<p>relentless litany of conquest, war, famine, and death, is to reassure his read-</p>
<p>ers that even though many of them will become martyrs, God will ultimately </p>
respond to the Empire’s tyranny with full divine judgment. Since most of us
<p>would prefer to rest even now in the scenes of chapters 4 and 5, the clos-</p>
<p>ing scene of heaven in the latter of these makes it clear that John is there </p>
<p>dealing with what God’s ultimate redemption of the world will look like. </p>
<p>Chapter 6 likewise makes it clear that until then, God’s people who refuse </p>
<p>to laud the Empire and “worship” its emperor will experience their tyranny. </p>
<p>Throughout the rest of the book, John will regularly remind his readers as to </p>
<p>how beguiling the great harlot can be.</p>
<p>In present times the beguiling temptress is an even more subtle siren, </p>
<p>taking the form of an economic and cultural complex that has allowed the </p>
<p>large majority of citizens in both English-speaking North America and much </p>
<p>of Europe to rest in the basic comfort of the “sweet buy and buy”—despite </p>
<p>its economic disparities and coarse underbelly of sexual wantonness and </p>
<p>continual pursuit of pleasure as an end in itself. If the believer’s resistance </p>
<p>to such a lifestyle comes onto the world’s radar—or electronic screen of </p>
<p>some kind—such a person can be assured that their contrary point of view </p>
<p>will not go unnoticed, and will lead to their being scorned or ostracized. As </p>
<p>Isaac Watts put it strongly, this “vile world” is “not a friend to grace, to help </p>
<p>us on to God,” because there are indeed still “foes for us to face,” subtle </p>
<p>though so many of them may be. Thus modern readers also need to return </p>
<p>to the present scenes again and again to be reminded that this planet is still </p>
<p>“our Father’s world,” and a continuing object of God’s love and grace.</p>
