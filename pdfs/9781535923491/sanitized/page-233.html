<p>Prelude: e Seven Angels with the Last Plagues </p>
<p>211</p>
<p>Exodus, as the martyrs once again stand by the sea, as it were (Exodus </p>
<p>14), anticipating God’s judgment against their “Pharaoh.” us, with </p>
<p>a second I saw, and with a deliberate recall of the picture in 4:6, John </p>
<p>describes again what looked like a sea of glass, only in this case the </p>
<p>sea is now glowing with re. Although one can only guess as to the </p>
<p>signicance of this addition, it ts the present introduction to chapter </p>
<p>16, so that the once (apparently) calm sea now anticipates the judgment </p>
<p>that is to come.</p>
<p>As elsewhere John’s interest is not so much in the “furniture” of </p>
<p>heaven as in the primary reason for the present scene, having to do </p>
<p>with those who were standing beside the sea. In light of the image that </p>
<p>has preceded it in 14:1–5—not to mention the special place they are </p>
<p>accorded later in 20:1–6—John is most likely (once more) here pro-</p>
<p>phetically embracing those who are soon to become martyrs. Here they </p>
<p>are singled out in particular with echoes of John’s own language from </p>
<p>chapter 13. at they are the martyrs is made clear by the description </p>
<p>that follows: these are those who had been victorious over the beast </p>
<p>and its image, which thus also included victory over the number of its </p>
name. us with splendid, divine irony, John pictures those who were
<p>originally conquered by the beast as now in heaven and “victorious </p>
<p>over” him. But in contrast to the four living creatures and the twenty-</p>
<p>four elders in 5:8, these triumphant followers of the Lamb themselves </p>
<p>held harps, which, in a most remarkable moment in the book, had </p>
<p>been given them by God. In turn, and in yet another striking moment, </p>
<p>with harps in hand they sang the song of God’s servant Moses and of </p>
<p>the Lamb.</p>
<p>is collocation of Moses and the Lamb should catch the reader’s </p>
<p>attention, especially the fact that these singers are surely to be under-</p>
<p>stood as the martyrs; so why “the song of Moses,” one might well ask? </p>
<p>e most likely answer is twofold. First, much of the narrative has clear </p>
<p>echoes of Exodus 14, where Israel also stood by the sea—although the </p>
<p>present sea is now mingled with the re of judgment. But of special </p>
<p>interest is “the Song of Moses, the servant of God” (Exod 14:31), which </p>
<p>follows in Exodus 15. at song had three basic components: verses </p>
<p>1–10 celebrate God as Warrior, who overthrew Pharaoh and his chari-</p>
<p>ots while at the same time redeeming his people Israel; verses 11–12 are </p>
<p>clearly swing verses, which celebrate by way of rhetorical questions that </p>
<p>God’s mighty acts of judgment had made clear that Yahweh is superior </p>
