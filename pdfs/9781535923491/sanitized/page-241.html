<p>e Seven Bowls Are Poured Out</p>
<p>219</p>
<p>the English translation(s): because you have so judged, which in Greek </p>
<p>as in English means simply that “you have judged in this way.” </p>
<p>Although this kind of phrase is oen lled with ambiguity, as to </p>
<p>whether it points backward (to the preceding three expressions of judg-</p>
<p>ment/justice) or forward, John in this case relieves the ambiguity, by </p>
<p>oering the quid pro quo itself, which is basically expressed as “blood </p>
<p>for blood.” us, even though what John says amounts to because . . . </p>
<p>they have shed . . . blood, you have given them blood to drink,”</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>he</p>
<p>actually puts this a bit more strongly. First up, in terms of the blood </p>
<p>they shed, it is that of “your holy ones,” which traditionally has been </p>
<p>translated “your saints,” and which the NIV translators have rendered </p>
<p>as your people. e reason for going this route has to do with the unfor-</p>
<p>tunate thing that has happened in English to the biblical word for “your </p>
<p>holy people,” which is simply a reference to all those who belong to the </p>
<p>newly constituted people of God. In this case, and in most other New </p>
<p>Testament contexts, this is simply biblical language for God’s people as a </p>
<p>whole, not for a special group of “holy” ones among that people. But for </p>
<p>the ordinary English reader, the language of either “saints” or “your holy </p>
<p>people” means exactly that—a special class of the truly “holy” among all </p>
<p>the rest. English translators thus have to choose between what leads to </p>
<p>a considerable misunderstanding or what is merely bland; and the NIV </p>
<p>translators (rightly) chose the latter in this case so as not to mislead </p>
<p>the reader into thinking that John is here dealing with a special group </p>
<p>among the whole, rather than with the whole itself.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>What the reader</p>
<p>must not miss in this case is that John starts with the whole people of </p>
<p>God and then includes those who function as prophets among them, </p>
<p>meaning in this case, as with Paul in 1 Corinthians, those who by the </p>
<p>Spirit regularly speak a prophetic word into the life of these communi-</p>
<p>ties. erefore, martyrdoms are to be expected by any and all, not just </p>
<p>those who function as “prophets,” as John himself does. us “the blood </p>
<p>of your people” includes “your prophets.”</p>
<p>11. Cf. the judgment in Isa 49:26: “[your oppressors] will be drunk on their own </p>
<p>blood, as with wine.”</p>
<p>12. is diculty can be seen by way of a quick survey of some of the more recent </p>
<p>translations into English. Most have simply given up and continue to use “saints,” de-</p>
<p>spite the fact that this word is now especially misleading in English. Among the major </p>
<p>translations, only the NIV and the NAB (“the holy ones”) have tried to get away from </p>
<p>using this misleading English term.</p>
