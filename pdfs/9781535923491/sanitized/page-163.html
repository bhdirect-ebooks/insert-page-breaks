<p>Interlude 1: e Angel and the Little Scroll</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>trouble for many interpreters, since what is said of the angel’s face and </p>
<p>feet clearly pick up on what is said of Christ in 1:15 and 16. is con-</p>
<p>nection with the vision in chapter 1 has caused some to argue that John </p>
<p>intended his readers to see Christ himself in this imagery. But that is </p>
<p>highly questionable, since it is hardly imaginable that John would have </p>
<p>intended Christ in an identication that reads, “another mighty angel.” </p>
<p>Rather, what John intends is most likely associative: that this angel who </p>
<p>reects some of Christ’s own glory has come with Christ’s authority.</p>
<p>Indeed, the rest of the description seems deliberately intended </p>
<p>to emphasize the angel’s coming down from heaven with especially </p>
divine authority. First, he was robed in a cloud, perhaps an intentional
<p>echo of Exodus 13:21, where Yahweh went ahead of Israel “in a pillar </p>
<p>of cloud to guide them.” Second, he appeared with a rainbow above </p>
<p>his head, which possibly functions as something of a halo. Here John is </p>
<p>picking up on his own imagery of the throne in 4:3. ird, his face was </p>
<p>like the sun, which seems to be a clear recall of Christ’s own appearance </p>
<p>in 1:16, and which has led to the mistaken view that the whole is thus a </p>
<p>description of Christ. Rather as noted above, John’s intent seems to be </p>
<p>associative in this case—the mighty angel sent from heaven has some </p>
<p>of the characteristics of the One who sent him. And fourth, his legs </p>
<p>were like ery pillars, which echoes, although not precisely so, what is </p>
<p>said of Christ in 1:15: “his feet [not legs] were like bronze glowing in a </p>
<p>furnace.” It is both the clear echoes and the imprecisions between this </p>
<p>description and that of Christ in chapter 1 that would seem to negate </p>
<p>the identication of the present angel with the Son of God himself; at </p>
the same time the deliberate echoes themselves emphasize the divine
<p>authority of the angel, that he has been sent as Christ’s representative.</p>
<p>More signicant for John than the description as such is what the </p>
<p>angel was sent to do. In a somewhat chiastic fashion John introduces a </p>
<p>little scroll, which lay open in the angel’s hand. is scroll will remain </p>
<p>on hold in the narrative until verses 8 and following, where John him-</p>
<p>self is commanded to eat the scroll. Moreover, when John does return </p>
<p>to the scroll, he repeats that it “lies open in the hand of the angel,” thus </p>
<p>emphasizing that its contents were eventually to be made known. But </p>
<p>before returning to the scroll itself, John further elaborates on the role </p>
<p>of the angel who is holding it (vv. 2b–7).</p>
<p>First up, John narrates that the mighty angel planted his right foot </p>
<p>on the sea and his le foot on the land. Since this phenomenon is re-</p>
