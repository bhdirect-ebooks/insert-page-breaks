<p>e Two Beasts</p>
<p>181</p>
<p>turn of the second century, Satan ultimately lay behind the Empire and </p>
<p>all evils associated with it.</p>
<p>But what happens next (v. 3) is a totally new twist, an altogether </p>
<p>Johannine reection of a common legend about Nero. It is now ex-</p>
<p>pressed, however, in language that also functions as a deliberate parody </p>
<p>of the death and resurrection of Christ, a parody that is a bit dicult </p>
<p>to put into English and is therefore missing in the NIV. us where </p>
<p>the present text reads regarding one of the heads of the beast that it </p>
<p>seemed to have a fatal wound, the Greek is expressed in language re-</p>
<p>ecting the Gospel accounts (“a head that had been slain unto death”), </p>
<p>which is further described not as “a fatal wound,” but as a plague of </p>
<p>death from which it had been healed. It should also be noted that even </p>
<p>though the present imagery is almost certainly a reection on the Nero </p>
redivivus myth (Nero returned to life, as it were), the implication of the
<p>nal clause is that the beast itself (thus Rome) had been healed, which </p>
<p>in turn will lead all “the earth and its inhabitants” to worship this rst </p>
<p>beast (v. 12). us, reecting his own take on recent history, John notes </p>
<p>that the whole world was lled with wonder and followed the beast. </p>
<p>erefore, even though in John’s narrative the beast has done nothing </p>
<p>yet except appear, the entire known world of that time have become fol-</p>
<p>lowers of the beast. From John’s perspective this in turn meant that they </p>
<p>also thereby worshiped the dragon. us John perceives the whole </p>
<p>Empire as following a perverse sort of death and resurrection, all of </p>
<p>which had been orchestrated by Satan himself. So, in parody of Exodus </p>
<p>15:11 (cf. Ps 89:8), they worshiped the beast by asking, Who is like the </p>
<p>beast? Who can make war against it? Of course, from John’s perspec-</p>
<p>tive this is a purely rhetorical question, because God’s people are about </p>
<p>to be slain not because they “make war against” Rome, but because in </p>
<p>eect they refuse to “make war” in her behalf.</p>
<p>e second part of the narrative (vv. 5–8) goes on to detail the </p>
<p>beast’s activities. In verses 5 and 6 John describes its blasphemies, and </p>
<p>then in verse 7 describes its conquest of Christian believers; this latter </p>
<p>is then further described with language from 5:9. In verse 8 in turn, the </p>
<p>two groups portrayed to this point (God’s people, and the rest—those </p>
<p>who worship the beast) are pictured in sharply contrasting terms.</p>
<p>us, again picking up the numerical gure forty-two months </p>
<p>from Daniel 7, John begins by indicating the nature of the beast’s activi-</p>
<p>ties that were allowed him: to utter proud words and blasphemies. e </p>
