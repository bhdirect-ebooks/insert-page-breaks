<p>Revelation 9:13–21</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>more verbally describing visual imagery, John tells the reader that the </p>
<p>heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions, imagery that is then </p>
<p>intensied by what was seen coming out of their mouths: re, smoke </p>
<p>and sulfur. us what John saw coming out of the mouths of the horses </p>
<p>corresponded in part to the breastplates of the riders themselves. He </p>
<p>then concludes his description of this immense cavalry by continuing </p>
<p>to focus on the horses, whose power . . . was in their mouths and </p>
<p>in their tails. us the pain to be inicted would come not from the </p>
<p>riders, but from the now demonic horses, who are nally described as </p>
<p>something of a cross between snakes and scorpions. At the same time, </p>
<p>here is a place where John’s verbal description of a visual image pushes </p>
<p>hard against the reader’s own visual imagination. at is, the horses’ </p>
<p>tails were like snakes—an easily manageable image—but the tails </p>
<p>themselves are seen as having snake-like heads with which they inict </p>
<p>injury. In the end, therefore, it is these apocalyptic horses, not their rid-</p>
<p>ers, who are envisioned as having power both to kill, by what came out </p>
<p>of their lion-like mouths (v. 18), and to inict painful injury, by means </p>
<p>of their snake-like tails (v. 19).</p>
<p>is sixth woe is nally brought to its conclusion with the summa-</p>
<p>tion of results that appear in verses 20–21. At the same time, John’s very </p>
<p>long and complex Greek sentence also serves to conclude the results </p>
<p>of all six of the preceding plagues (which began in 8:6). e conclu-</p>
<p>sion itself has altogether to do with continuing human resistance to the </p>
<p>warnings that should have been evident in the plagues themselves. As </p>
<p>with Pharaoh in the Exodus, the rest of the people who were not killed </p>
<p>by these plagues still did not repent. And at this point John’s own very </p>
<p>Jewish, very Christian revulsion toward idolatry takes center stage by </p>
<p>way of this scathing denunciation of paganism.</p>
<p>One can especially hear the repugnance in the way John goes on </p>
<p>to describe “the rest of the people” in terms of their not repenting of </p>
<p>the work of their hands. is is a thoroughly biblical way of deriding </p>
<p>idolatry, where, quite in keeping with Paul in 1 Corinthians 10:20–21, </p>
<p>John echoes the mockery of Isaiah 2:6–8 and 44:9–20. In the former </p>
<p>passage the prophet, aer cataloguing Israel’s rejection of Yahweh, con-</p>
<p>cludes, “their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their </p>
<p>hands, to what their ngers have made.” is is the ultimate irony for </p>
<p>any believer in Yahweh, the living God; that human beings, themselves </p>
created in the divine image, should try to create deities for themselves
