<p>Revelation 2:12–17</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>of pagan worship, or to the worship of Asclepius whose symbol was </p>
<p>a serpent, or to the prominence of emperor worship. Although I lean </p>
<p>toward the latter, it may well be that John’s appellation was simply a way </p>
<p>of emphasizing the accumulative aect of these pagan realities. Nor is </p>
<p>it surprising that for the church in this city John picks up imagery from </p>
<p>chapter 1, to the eect that what follows are the words of him who </p>
<p>has the sharp, double-edged sword, words that are intended not to </p>
<p>threaten, but to encourage the believers in this ultra-pagan setting.</p>
<p>e opening sentence (all of v. 13) is one of the more convoluted </p>
<p>in the entire book, and has rightly been broken up in the NIV into </p>
<p>something more manageable in English. Furthermore, as with Smyrna, </p>
<p>John does not begin with an acknowledgement of their “deeds,” but </p>
<p>with the fact that you remain true to my name, despite the onslaught </p>
<p>of paganism that surrounded them at every turn.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>But it was not that</p>
<p>onslaught John had in mind, but the fact that persecution in Pergamum </p>
<p>had already resulted in one of the earliest known martyrdoms in </p>
<p>Christian history, that of Antipas, my faithful witness,</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>who was put</p>
<p>to death in your city. e believers there would thus have had good </p>
<p>reason, humanly speaking, to renounce your faith in me; that they did </p>
<p>not do so is what stands center stage in this strong commendation of </p>
<p>them. Here are followers of the Crucied One who have learned from </p>
<p>experience that discipleship in his name could mean death at the hands </p>
<p>of the Empire, just as Christ himself had experienced. And all of this </p>
<p>because they live where Satan lives, John’s now-Christian epithet for a </p>
<p>city where Christian blood is rst known to have been spilt.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite these warm armations, the risen Christ </p>
<p>had a few things to say against you. e “few things” in this case turn </p>
<p>out to be two, both of which have to do with some among you who </p>
<p>hold to two dierent forms of false teaching, both of which, since they </p>
<p>are noted only here in ancient literature, are otherwise not known to </p>
<p>us with any degree of certainty (although there has been a long history </p>
<p>10. Because of its location on a very high butte, there were no roads or highways </p>
<p>going through, and thus in and out of, Pergamum. It was reached only by a long en-</p>
<p>circling road that went to the city, and nowhere else. us to live in Pergamum as a </p>
<p>Christian meant to be reminded constantly of its thoroughly pagan culture.</p>
<p>11. is is the rst instance in Christian literature where the Greek word for “wit-</p>
<p>ness” (martyr) refers to one whose witness led to death. In time this kind of witness </p>
<p>caused the Greek word, as a borrowed word, to refer in Christian circles to that special </p>
<p>kind of witness (unto death) that lies behind its present meaning in English.</p>
