<p>To the Church in Pergamum</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>ther promise in 3:12 (cf. 22:3–4) that Christ’s own name will be written </p>
<p>on the foreheads of the redeemed. For now each has his or her own </p>
“new name,” known only to the individual believer. In a cultural con-
<p>text where naming carried a great deal more signicance than it does </p>
<p>in most Western cultures (the exceptions are when people are named </p>
<p>aer someone of importance to the family involved), this eschatological </p>
<p>promise is an important reminder that Christ knows his own and gives </p>
<p>them their new name. In John’s day, and for a church that had already </p>
<p>known a degree of persecution, this was surely intended to be a means </p>
<p>of considerable encouragement.</p>
<p>To the Church in Thyatira (2:18–29)</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>“To the angel of the church in yatira write:</p>
<p>ese are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like blaz-</p>
<p>ing re and whose feet are like burnished bronze. </p>
<p>19</p>
<p>I know your </p>
<p>deeds, your love and faith, your service and perseverance, and </p>
<p>that you are now doing more than you did at rst.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman </p>
<p>Jezebel, who calls herself a prophet. By her teaching she misleads </p>
<p>my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacri-</p>
<p>ced to idols. </p>
<p>21</p>
<p>I have given her time to repent of her immorality, </p>
<p>but she is unwilling. </p>
<p>22</p>
<p>So I will cast her on a bed of suering, and </p>
<p>I will make those who commit adultery with her suer intensely, </p>
<p>unless they repent of her ways. </p>
<p>23</p>
<p>I will strike her children dead. </p>
<p>en all the churches will know that I am he who searches hearts </p>
<p>and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds. </p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Now I say to the rest of you in yatira, to you who do not hold </p>
<p>to her teaching and have not learned Satan’s so-called deep secrets, </p>
<p>‘I will not impose any other burden on you, </p>
<p>25</p>
<p>except to hold on to </p>
<p>what you have until I come.’</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>To those who are victorious and do my will to the end, I will </p>
<p>give authority over the nations—</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>they ‘will rule them with an </p>
<p>iron scepter and will dash them to pieces like pottery’</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>—just as </p>
<p>I have received authority from my Father. </p>
<p>28</p>
<p>I will also give them </p>
<p>the morning star. </p>
<p>29</p>
<p>Whoever has ears, let them hear what the </p>
<p>Spirit says to the churches.</p>
<p>Although yatira was probably the least signicant of the seven cities/</p>
<p>towns to which John wrote, the letter they received is the longest of the </p>
<p>12. Psalm 2:9</p>
