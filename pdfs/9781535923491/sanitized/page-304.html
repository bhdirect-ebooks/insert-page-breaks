<p>Revelation 20:1–6 </p>
<p>282</p>
<p>wise easily resolved; but it does seem unfortunate that so many would </p>
<p>take this one number, in a book of so many other symbolic numbers of </p>
<p>a variety of kinds, and build an actual temporal millennium on it. Not </p>
<p>that one should not take the number seriously as such; rather, there are </p>
<p>two interpretive questions that need to be asked: rst, what is the role </p>
<p>of this passage in the narrative as a whole, since what follows makes </p>
<p>it clear that this paragraph is not related to the Final End as such; and </p>
<p>second, what then is the meaning of the concluding clause, aer that, </p>
<p>he must be set free for a short time?</p>
<p>e answer to the rst question is the more complex, since Jewish </p>
<p>apocalypses (aer Daniel) regularly have such a moment in them, al-</p>
<p>though this is the only instance of “a thousand years” as such. Millennial </p>
<p>ideas, for example, can be found in 2 Baruch 29–30 and the Psalms of </p>
<p>Solomon 17; but neither of these specify a thousand-year time period, </p>
<p>rather they look forward to a time of messianic bliss on earth. However, </p>
<p>in neither of these cases is there also a nal “heavenly” existence as well. </p>
<p>us, whatever millennial ideas may have preceded John, the present </p>
<p>passage is remarkably his own, and has specically to do with the spe-</p>
cial place Christian martyrs have in the divine economy.
<p>An answer to the second question is even more dicult to come </p>
<p>by, but is most likely related to what has already been suggested, that </p>
<p>John’s major concern here is not with time as such, but with the spe-</p>
<p>cial place God has reserved for those who have been killed by the state </p>
<p>simply because they were followers of the once slain, now risen Lamb. </p>
<p>In any case, John’s obvious concern lies with the second paragraph (vv. </p>
<p>4–6), and thus not with the time period as such. e picture itself is </p>
<p>ultimately about the role of the martyrs during the thousand-year pe-</p>
<p>riod. And even though there is no specic geographical location given, </p>
<p>John seems clearly to have planet earth still in view. is is made certain </p>
<p>by the language about “the nations” in verse 3 and the picture of the </p>
<p>resurrected martyrs “reigning” with Christ, plus the reality that it is lit-</p>
<p>erarily sandwiched between the Last Battle in 19:11–21 and the release </p>
<p>of Satan to “deceive the nations” in 20:7–10. is “geographical” matter </p>
<p>is most likely brought forward here because John’s interest is altogether </p>
<p>on the role of the martyrs during the thousand years. is is made clear </p>
<p>by what is rst up: I saw thrones on which were seated those who had </p>
<p>been given authority to judge, who, we are then told at the end of the </p>
<p>verse, came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But ev-</p>
