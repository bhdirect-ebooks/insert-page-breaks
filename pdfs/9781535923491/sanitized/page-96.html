<p>Revelation 4:6b–11</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>eternal (“who lives for ever and ever”; cf. Dan 4:34). First they give him </p>
<p>“glory,” which has to do with God’s own inherent splendor or magni-</p>
<p>cence, thus using language to give expression to the creatures’ wonder </p>
<p>in the presence of that splendor.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Second, they give him “honor,” a form</p>
<p>of acknowledging God’s inherent worthiness to receive praise from his </p>
<p>creatures. And third, they give him “thanks,” the inherent recognition </p>
that everything the creation is or the creature has comes as a divine gi.
<p>us the proper posture of all beings created with the power of thought </p>
<p>and speech is thanksgiving, to accompany the praise.</p>
<p>Whoever the twenty-four elders are intended to represent (most </p>
<p>likely God’s faithful people under both covenants), their proper heavenly </p>
<p>response to the worship oered by the four living creatures is twofold. </p>
<p>First, they lay their crowns before the throne, a clear acknowledgment </p>
<p>that nothing is theirs as an inherent right, but that everything is gi. us </p>
<p>even their own “earned” glory is acknowledged as belonging ultimately </p>
<p>to him who sits on the throne and lives for ever and ever. Second, they </p>
<p>burst into endless praise, declaring God’s worthiness for such because ev-</p>
<p>eryone and everything in the whole of creation owes its existence to God. </p>
<p>us their song takes the form, rst, of acknowledging God as worthy </p>
<p>. . . to receive the glory and honor noted in the preceding sentence </p>
<p>(v. 9). But now in place of “thanks” the nal noun is power, which is </p>
<p>an obvious attribute of God, but is a strange noun to follow the verb </p>
<p>“receive.” Most likely the problem for us here is a matter of English, </p>
<p>and has to do with the Greek verb in this case, which can mean either </p>
<p>“take” or “receive,” and thus one for which the word “power” as an ob-</p>
<p>ject would not create any diculty for the native Greek speaker. ey </p>
<p>would simply hear it in the same way that an English speaker would </p>
<p>hear the phrase “take power.”</p>
<p>e heavenly anthem then concludes with the present reason for </p>
God’s divine worthiness, all having to do with God as Creator. God as
<p>Redeemer is saved for part 3 of this heavenly vision (our chapter 5) with </p>
<p>the entrance of the Lamb. us the present hymn concludes with a bi-</p>
<p>colon (put into a tricolon in English) that extols God as Creator, with </p>
<p>the kind of repetition that has such inherent power in both Greek and </p>
<p>Hebrew.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>e rst line puts it positively, beginning with a causal for</p>
<p>7. At the human level it might nd expression over the beauty of a woman or the </p>
<p>physique of a man.</p>
<p>8. is, aer all, is a native Aramaic speaker expressing himself in Greek.</p>
