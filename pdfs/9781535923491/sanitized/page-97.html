<p>and stated in the active voice: you created all things. e second line </p>
<p>then accentuates this reality in the passive and adds the note of agency, </p>
which in the divine order of things can be attributed altogether to God’s
<p>own purposes, thus by your will they were created. e third line, still </p>
<p>in keeping with the repetitive force of Hebrew poetry, simply adds the </p>
<p>nal verb, and have their being. us in marvelous poetry John height-</p>
<p>ens the eect of their worship by adding this nal verb. Creation is not </p>
<p>about reshaping something that already existed and making it some-</p>
<p>thing else; rather it has to do with what theologians have long called </p>
<p>ex nihilo (“from nothing”), which has to do with bringing into being </p>
<p>what did not exist before. With this hymn therefore, John, whose work </p>
<p>providentially concludes the Christian canon, echoes the rst book of </p>
<p>the canon (Genesis) by reminding his readers that the rst beings men-</p>
<p>tioned in the heavenly setting begin their praise where Scripture itself </p>
<p>begins, with God as Creator.</p>
<p>us with the two hymns of this opening scene in heaven, the four </p>
<p>living beings, who in some way at least represent the angelic throng, in </p>
<p>song emphasize God’s holiness, while the twenty-four elders, who rep-</p>
<p>resent God’s people from both covenants, emphasize God as Creator.</p>
<p>The Unopened Scroll (5:1–4)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>en I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll </p>
<p>with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>And I saw </p>
<p>a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to </p>
<p>break the seals and open the scroll?” </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>But no one in heaven or on </p>
<p>earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside </p>
<p>it. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to </p>
<p>open the scroll or look inside.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>With these words John sets the scene for one of the great moments in all </p>
<p>known literature. Indeed, so remarkable is the vision that an interpreter </p>
<p>is made to pause and wonder whether his or her own words, in trying </p>
<p>to comment on it at all, might not get in the way of its splendor. e </p>
<p>9. Several witnesses, including one of considerable importance (codex A), do not </p>
<p>contain v. 4 at all. But this is a clear case of omission, rather than addition, based on </p>
<p>the fact that both vv. 3 and 4 end in exactly the same way (oute blepein auto, “neither </p>
<p>to look at it”), and a scribe (perhaps more than one) in returning to the text he was </p>
<p>copying picked it up at the end of our v. 4, rather than v. 3, so that he copied vv. 3 and </p>
<p>5, but without v. 4.</p>
