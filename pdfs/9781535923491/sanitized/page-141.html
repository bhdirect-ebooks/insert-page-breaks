<p>e Seventh Seal: Prelude to the Seven Trumpets</p>

<p>all God’s people, on the golden altar in front of the throne. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>e </p>
<p>smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of God’s people, </p>
<p>went up before God from the angel’s hand. </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>en the angel took </p>
<p>the censer, lled it with re from the altar, and hurled it on the </p>
<p>earth; and there came peals of thunder, rumblings, ashes of light-</p>
<p>ning and an earthquake.</p>
<p>e rst thing up aer the Lamb opens the seventh seal is silence (v. </p>
<p>1), aer which John introduces seven angels who stand in the presence </p>
<p>of God and who are given seven trumpets (v. 2). But before they do </p>
<p>anything, another angel appears, who oers on the altar the prayers of </p>
<p>the saints (vv. 3–4). en at the end of the paragraph (v. 5) John experi-</p>
<p>ences a spectacular theophany, reminiscent of Exodus 19 and occurring </p>
<p>again in Isaiah 29:6. e phenomena themselves rst appeared in 4:5 </p>
<p>(q.v.), but now they include an earthquake.</p>
<p>John thus begins the prelude by bringing closure to the seven seals </p>
<p>(v. 1) and immediately introducing the seven trumpets (v. 2). us his </p>
<p>opening clause picks up the narrative that had been dropped at 6:12–17: </p>
<p>When he [the Lamb] opened the seventh seal. In light of its signi-</p>
<p>cance in chapter 5, one might expect that the scroll itself would now </p>
<p>be read. But no, not only does John not do anything so pedestrian, he </p>
<p>never mentions the scroll itself again—although another little scroll will </p>
<p>appear in chapter 10, whose meaning is a matter of considerable debate </p>
<p>among interpreters. In the present case, one is also caught by surprise </p>
<p>that the opening of the seventh seal is not accompanied by loud sounds </p>
<p>of various kinds, as in earlier moments (trumpet blasts, shouts, etc.); </p>
<p>rather the reader is caught up short with silence in heaven for about </p>
<p>half an hour. is is most likely intended to arouse awe and wonder, </p>
<p>not to mention anticipation. en, in place of someone’s reading the </p>
<p>scroll, we are rather introduced to its content by way of yet another </p>
<p>vision, which as before is a marvelously craed piece of imagery.</p>
<p>Aer the silence, therefore, John introduces the seven angels </p>
<p>who stand before God, to whom seven trumpets were given. Both </p>
<p>of these phenomena have been points of considerable dierence as to </p>
<p>their meaning and role in the narrative, for which certainty is not easy </p>
<p>to come by. “e seven angels” are introduced with the Greek denite </p>
<p>article, which indicates not merely that “seven angels appeared,” but </p>
<p>that they are either “the seven angels, the well-known ones” or “the </p>
