<p>Revelation 5:7–13</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>in heaven and on the earth and under the sea—everything that is in </p>
<p>them—saying.”</p>
<p>e climax of the narrative is thus reached in their doxology, which </p>
<p>in the language of John’s Gospel is to both Father and Son together, but </p>
<p>in the language of the present imagery is put, To him who sits on the </p>
<p>throne and to the Lamb. As before, the extremely high Christology </p>
<p>is unmistakable, in that the praise that follows is that which can be </p>
<p>given to God alone, or else one’s praise borders on a new form of idola-</p>
<p>try, where the one and only God is now seen as two separate deities. </p>
<p>Indeed, so radical is this new acclamation oered to the one God that </p>
<p>the church was quickly thrown into at least two centuries of trying to </p>
<p>hammer out how such revealed truth can be spoken in merely human </p>
<p>language, without ending up either with two deities or with a way of </p>
handling Johannine Christology that would minimize the clearly divine
<p>nature and role of the Son.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>But John himself is as plain as can be with</p>
<p>this nal acclamation. us both “to him who sits on the throne and </p>
<p>to the Lamb”—and now picking up four of the acclamations from the </p>
<p>preceding “song”—be praise and honor and glory and power forever </p>
<p>and ever! It should perhaps be noted at the end, and hopefully not so as </p>
<p>to diminish the glory and praise oered Christ as well as to the Father, </p>
<p>that these four words, apparently taken at some random from the pre-</p>
ceding list, are best understood not individually, but collectively. eir
<p>power lies not in their separate meanings, either in Greek or in English </p>
<p>translation, but in their collective intensity, and thus their potential </p>
<p>to arouse wonder and adoration in the readers themselves. And such </p>
<p>readers, of any calendrical age and in every generation, are thus being </p>
<p>invited into the praise that is oered to Father and Son together, which </p>
<p>seems to be at least part of the intent of John’s own “for ever and ever.” </p>
<p>ose who read only and do not worship would seem to have missed </p>
<p>the implications of these nal words, not to mention would stand aloof </p>
<p>from what John would have expected of his rst readers.</p>
<p>at such worship on the part of his readers is John’s own intent </p>
<p>seems to be made certain by his nal sentence, which wraps up the </p>
<p>scene, as it were. erefore, the nal response to “the voice of many </p>
<p>27. Some scribes, in as early as the fourth century, omitted the kai (“and”) between </p>
<p>“on the throne [and] the lamb,” thus creating the anomaly “to the Lamb who sits on the </p>
<p>throne.” If this were purposeful, it would seem to have been intended to heighten, not </p>
<p>to minimize, the deity of Christ. More likely it was simply an accidental omission.</p>
