<p>e Seven Bowls Are Poured Out</p>

<p>encouraging watchfulness on the part of his disciples. It is also used in </p>
<p>Paul’s earliest letter (1 ess 5:2), as something his readers “know very </p>
<p>well,” thus indicating that it is probably a common metaphor among the </p>
<p>early Christians.</p>
<p>e imagery itself needs to be understood for what it is: imagery, </p>
<p>pure and simple. At issue is the purpose of the image, since the com-</p>
parison of the divine Savior to a thief does not sit well with those in
<p>Western cultures, who generally nd metaphors dicult to manage in </p>
<p>any case. But, as in the Synoptic tradition, the comparison is not with </p>
<p>the thief as such, but with the way a thief comes—at night, and therefore </p>
<p>when one is not on guard, but (properly so) sleeping. e assumption </p>
<p>of the metaphor, of course, is cultural, that people slept basically in the </p>
<p>nude; the diculty with the metaphor, therefore, lies not with its basic </p>
<p>intent, that one cannot know the when of Christ’s return. But the point </p>
<p>of the metaphor is a simple one, and reects the teaching of Jesus, that </p>
<p>God’s people need to be on watch, as it were, always anticipating his </p>
<p>Coming.</p>
<p>e call itself is then followed by another beatitude (the h of </p>
<p>seven), in this case a “blessing” that on rst reading is again full of sur-</p>
<p>prises, especially for readers who belong to a dierent time and culture. </p>
<p>e key to understanding lies with what immediately precedes: the nal </p>
<p>sentence in verse 14, the sixth of the poured out bowls of God’s wrath, </p>
<p>which concludes with the imagery of warfare. e problem for the later </p>
<p>reader is not only the sudden shi of images, but the nature of the im-</p>
<p>ages themselves, especially so in this case because John’s point is singu-</p>
<p>lar: the need for preparedness on the part of God’s people, so that they </p>
<p>stay awake and are thus ready for their Lord’s return. ose who are not </p>
<p>ready in this way are thus pictured as not keeping their clothes on. But </p>
<p>that image, once struck, immediately calls for another one: the shame </p>
<p>associated with nudity, especially in John’s own Jewish heritage. us </p>
<p>the reason for the kind of preparedness imaged by being fully clothed </p>
<p>is then spelled out in full detail: so that they may not go naked and </p>
<p>be shamefully exposed. What one gets, therefore, is something fully </p>
<p>biblical in terms of quick shis of metaphor, all of which together call </p>
<p>the reader to a kind of watchfulness that means constant readiness for </p>
<p>Christ’s return.</p>
<p>With that in hand, the second part of the interlude simply returns </p>
<p>the reader to the narrative of the sixth trumpet, and thus anticipates the </p>
