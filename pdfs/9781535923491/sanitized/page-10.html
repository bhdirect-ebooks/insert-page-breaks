<p>Preface</p>
<p>x</p>
<p>worship; and what does it mean for contemporary people of God to be </p>
<p>a countercultural alternative in such a world, just as John himself was, </p>
<p>and was encouraging his readers to be? Furthermore, with theology </p>
<p>there must be worship, because whatever else is true about this marvel-</p>
<p>ous Revelation, John recognizes that truly Christian theology should </p>
<p>lead to doxology. at is, descriptions of God that do not lead to the </p>
<p>worship of God might be intellectually useful, but they are unrelated </p>
<p>to biblical reality; and biblical reality is what John wants his readers to </p>
see and hear. In a form of divine sovereignty that oen accompanies
<p>biblical prophecy, John wrote what turned out to be the nal book in </p>
<p>the Christian canon; and thus it serves ttingly as the climax to both the </p>
<p>New Testament and to the entire biblical story—which begins in Eden </p>
<p>and concludes with a restored Eden.</p>
<p>Finally, I should note that the biblical text used throughout is the </p>
<p>(yet to be published) 2011 edition of the NIV, which has been used by </p>
<p>permission of the Committee on Bible Translation who are responsible </p>
<p>for the translation (to which I have access before publication as a mem-</p>
<p>ber of the translation committee) and of the Zondervan Corporation </p>
<p>who will publish it.</p>
