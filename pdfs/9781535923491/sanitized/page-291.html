<p>e Fall of Babylon the Great</p>
<p>269</p>
<p>by way of his cross and resurrection. us the singular command is to </p>
<p>worship God!</p>
<p>With that John signs o this section of his narrative with a nal </p>
<p>word that is both one of the truly puzzling, and equally one of the truly </p>
<p>important, in the book. e original NIV had rendered this clause, “For </p>
<p>the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of prophecy,” leaving the reader basi-</p>
<p>cally to guess what that meant, as to whether “Jesus” is the intended </p>
<p>object or subject of “the testimony.” e updated NIV, almost certainly </p>
<p>correctly, has put the emphasis altogether on what John has written in </p>
<p>this book. Early on John had made clear that it is the Spirit who inspires </p>
<p>prophecy. us he “was in the Spirit” on the “Lord’s day” when the voice </p>
<p>behind him charged him to “write . . . what you see” (1:10). Now at </p>
<p>the end of the primary narrative, John will not allow his readers to do </p>
<p>what he attempted to do: worship the angel responsible for all of these </p>
<p>visions. But for John, the “worship” of God, is directed back to Jesus. </p>
<p>For this is what the Spirit of prophecy (= “the Spirit” who has inspired </p>
<p>this “prophecy”) has been about all along. He has been bearing wit-</p>
<p>ness to Jesus. And, of course, this concluding word is likewise almost </p>
<p>certainly directed toward John’s readers, that their true worship of God </p>
<p>is evidenced in their continuing, by means of the Spirit, to bear witness </p>
<p>to Jesus themselves.</p>
