<p>e Last Battle, Part 1: e Battle Itself</p>

<p>13:1 by a similar picture of the beast (the Empire) with seven heads and </p>
<p>ten crowns. ese represented a false, demonic royalty. Now the true </p>
<p>king of the universe comes on the scene, wearing “many crowns.”</p>
<p>But if the preceding imagery is easy enough to recognize, what </p>
<p>comes next is decidedly not so, in terms both of what is actually said </p>
<p>and what it means. us (literally) he has a name written . . . that no </p>
<p>one knows but he himself. Two matters here create diculties for the </p>
<p>later reader. First, what is lacking in this description is the location of </p>
<p>the name, which is usually placed variously in the translations as on </p>
<p>him in some way, and which some get around by simply rendering the </p>
<p>verb as “inscribed,” thus not needing a location. Second, and even more </p>
<p>puzzling, is the note that “no one knows” his name, since in fact he is </p>
<p>named in this passage, rst as the one who “is called Faithful and True,” </p>
<p>second as “the word of God,” and then nally as “KING OF KINGS </p>
<p>AND LORD OF LORDS” (v. 16). In the end, therefore, this remains one </p>
<p>of the truly puzzling moments in the book; it is intentionally cryptic, </p>
<p>and without an adequate explanation or discernable reason, unless it </p>
<p>is a Johannine way of keeping alive the contemporary Jewish refusal to </p>
<p>name God at all lest the name be taken in vain.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>What follows is an especially brief description of his garment, in </p>
<p>which the interest is not in what he wore as such (a robe) but in its </p>
<p>present condition: dipped in blood. Whereas many knowledgeable </p>
<p>Christian readers are likely to view this in terms of Christ’s sacrice </p>
<p>on the cross, it seems far more likely in this case to be imagery point-</p>
<p>ing to the soon-to-be bloodbath of those who remain faithful to his </p>
<p>name. us even as the leader of the cavalry, which is described next as </p>
<p>“the armies of heaven [that] were following him,” the risen and exalted </p>
<p>Christ is recognizable, since in the context of this imagery he continues </p>
<p>to bear the marks of his incarnation and crucixion, but now for a dif-</p>
<p>ferent reason.</p>
<p>Just in case his readers might not get it right, and especially because </p>
<p>of the importance of getting it right at this point, John goes on further </p>
<p>7. It should also be noted that ancient scribes and later authors also had trouble </p>
<p>with the locution, usually adding what were perceived as missing words, so as to make </p>
<p>some sense of the grammar. is is very likely one of those rare moments in the his-</p>
<p>tory of the transmission of the NT text where a very early scribal error made its way </p>
<p>into the text and was not corrected by the scribe himself, so that we are le only with </p>
<p>guesses as to what John intended.</p>
