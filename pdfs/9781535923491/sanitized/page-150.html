<p>Revelation 9:1–12</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>given the tense of the verb (“had fallen”), John apparently did not see. </p>
<p>e star itself then takes on lifelike qualities so as to set in motion the </p>
content of the woe. Narrating again in the “divine passive,” John tells us
<p>that the star was given the key to the sha of the Abyss, thus assuming </p>
that the major but unidentied player throughout the drama is divine.
<p>John of course expects his readers to assume that the star is an angelic </p>
<p>gure of some kind,</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>since it came “from the sky to the earth.” If so, then</p>
<p>this angel serves as a kind of parody of the Satan legend, where, for ex-</p>
<p>ample, in Luke 10:18, “Satan [fell] as a star from heaven.” is imagery </p>
<p>further corresponds to 8:10 above, where the “great star [that] fell from </p>
<p>the sky” is a clearly malevolent gure. As a parody of this imagery the </p>
<p>present, non-malevolent angel will set the next vision into motion; and </p>
<p>as an inclusio with this description John will conclude the entire scene </p>
<p>in verse 11 by naming Satan himself as “the angel of the Abyss,” who </p>
<p>also served as king of the scorpions.</p>
<p>One should also note that the present “sha of the Abyss” assumes, </p>
<p>along with the preceding picture of “heaven above,” a kind of three-</p>
<p>storied universe where “the heavens” are above the earth and the Abyss </p>
<p>(a word that is transliterated from the Greek) lies under its surface in </p>
<p>some way. In this case the Abyss is most likely a depiction of “hell,” in </p>
<p>the sense that it is the current abode of demonic forces in the under-</p>
<p>world, where they will also be kept until they are thrown into a nal </p>
<p>hell, depicted in 20:10 as “a lake of burning sulfur, where . . . they will </p>
<p>be tormented day and night for ever and ever.” us in the somewhat </p>
<p>repetitive fashion now familiar in John’s Apocalypse, the narrative con-</p>
tinues with the divine action of the star, who opened “the sha of”
<p>9</p>
<p> </p>
<p>the Abyss. What happens next assumes what the ancients themselves </p>
<p>would have surmised on the basis of volcanic eruptions: that under the </p>
<p>8. ere has, in fact, been a considerable amount of speculation as to whether John </p>
<p>also intended the star to represent something or someone. On the basis of 8:10, where </p>
<p>“a star falling from heaven” is a malevolent gure, the present “star” is oen thought </p>
<p>to be Satan. But that seems to founder on the content of both v. 1 (why would Satan </p>
<p>give himself the key to the Abyss?) and 20:1, where in typical fashion John seems to </p>
<p>be picking up and elaborating on something mentioned earlier in a more elliptical </p>
<p>fashion. Also, in the later passage the gure is specied as “an angel.”</p>
<p>9. Although the NIV, for the sake of the English reader, omits the repeated “the </p>
<p>sha of,” it has been restored here so that the reader of the commentary will catch a </p>
<p>sense of the repetitive nature of John’s Greek.</p>
