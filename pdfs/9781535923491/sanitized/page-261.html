<p>Rome as a Seductive Harlot</p>
<p>239</p>
<p>that some later emperors, in terms of their relationship to the Lamb and </p>
<p>his followers, would embody the monstrous character of Nero himself </p>
<p>as they would “wage war” against the followers of the Lamb.</p>
<p>e Interpretation of the Ten Horns (17:12–14)</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>“e ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received </p>
<p>a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings </p>
<p>along with the beast. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>ey have one purpose and will give their </p>
<p>power and authority to the beast. </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>ey will make war against </p>
<p>the Lamb, but the Lamb will triumph over them because he is </p>
<p>Lord of lords and King of kings—and with him will be his called, </p>
<p>chosen and faithful followers.”</p>
<p>What follows, as the next moment of interpretation of what John saw, </p>
<p>is an explanation of the ten horns, an interpretation that has caused </p>
<p>a good deal of trouble for those who read this text through the lens </p>
of a view of divine inspiration that requires more exactitude than is
<p>historically a part of the prophetic tradition. at is, the prophets were </p>
certain about the divine reality of God’s coming judgments on Israel’s
<p>enemies—or on Israel itself—and sometimes also about the nature of it. </p>
<p>But precision with regard to details, though it sometimes happened, is </p>
<p>simply not the point of their indictments; their universal concern was </p>
<p>with the certainty of it. Similarly, one cannot in the present instance </p>
<p>be sure whether John envisioned a precise number of monarchs who </p>
<p>would come from the east and overpower Rome, or whether, as oen </p>
<p>in this book, ten is being used as the number representing fullness or </p>
<p>completeness. If the latter, as seems most likely, then John’s intent is that </p>
<p>the whole of the petty monarchs in the east will band together as one in </p>
<p>an attempt to throw o the Roman yoke. John’s present point, however, </p>
<p>is not precision about their number, but about their unity in purpose. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the rest of the passage is most likely not intended by John </p>
<p>to picture peoples from the lands of the Euphrates, but the petty kings </p>
<p>of what was known as Asia Minor, mostly modern-day Turkey. As it </p>
<p>turned out, this was an especially insightful prophetic moment by John, </p>
<p>since the provincials in this part of the Roman world, where John re-</p>
<p>sided and where Polycarp of Smyrna was later executed, were especially </p>
<p>keen on carrying out the emperor’s wishes on this matter. In any case </p>
<p>John recognizes clearly that even though these ten kings . . . have not </p>
