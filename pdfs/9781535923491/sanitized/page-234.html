<p>Revelation 15:1–8</p>
<p>212</p>
<p>to all other deities (“Who among the gods is like you, LORD? Who is </p>
<p>like you—majestic in holiness, awesome in glory, working wonders?”); </p>
<p>verses 13–18 then concentrate on the benets of redemption, especially </p>
<p>that Yahweh will lead them to his holy dwelling—and that the nations </p>
<p>will hear and tremble.</p>
<p>What follows is typical of John’s literary skill. He had already </p>
<p>echoed Exodus 15:11 in the parody of the beast in 13:4 (“who is like the </p>
<p>beast?”); now in verse 4a he returns to that question as the central fea-</p>
<p>ture of this hymn. On the front side (v. 3) of that crucial question, and </p>
<p>now echoing Psalm 139:14 and 145:17 (“your works are wonderful”), </p>
<p>John oers a hymnic commentary on Exodus 15:1–10, which extols the </p>
<p>great and wonderful nature of God’s works and the justice and truth of </p>
<p>God’s ways. On the back side (v. 4b), and in response to the question </p>
<p>itself, he arms that all the nations will come and worship God, but </p>
<p>concludes with the ultimate point of the section: the righteous charac-</p>
<p>ter of God’s judgments.</p>
<p>us quite in keeping with these concerns, the actual content of the </p>
<p>song is a collage of language from all over the Old Testament, including </p>
<p>the “Song of Moses” in the Greek version of Deuteronomy 32. John’s </p>
<p>version begins with an echo of Psalm 111:2 (LXX 110:2),</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Great and</p>
<p>marvelous are your deeds, while the address itself, Lord God Almighty, </p>
<p>is language derived from the Septuagint of Amos 3:13 and 4:13. us </p>
<p>the rst thing up has to do with God’s “mighty deeds.” Second, God is </p>
<p>praised because just and true are your ways, a collage of language from </p>
<p>the rst two lines of Deuteronomy 32:4. erefore, God’s “just way” of </p>
<p>carrying out those “mighty deeds” is very much in keeping with God’s </p>
<p>character. God is then addressed as King of the nations, echoing the </p>
<p>Hebrew of Jeremiah 10:7, as does the rst line of the next question: </p>
<p>Who will not fear you, Lord? e nal part of the stanza, and bring </p>
<p>glory to your name, comes directly from Psalm 86:9 (LXX 85:9). In </p>
<p>many ways this hymn is both a singular high point in John’s narrative </p>
<p>and a clear indication of how much his own spiritual life was nourished </p>
<p>on the (in this case Greek) Bible.</p>
<p>e next armation, for you alone are holy, is the rst of two </p>
<p>lines (cf. the nal line) that are not direct citations of an Old Testament </p>
<p>passage, although the sentiment can be found everywhere, as for ex-</p>
<p>3. In the English versions of the citations that follow, I have italicized the portions </p>
<p>where John’s Greek reects direct echoes of the Septuagint.</p>
