<p>Revelation 18:1—19:10</p>
<p>260</p>
<p>special role among the people of God are called upon to rejoice: rst, </p>
<p>the apostles, who appear here for the rst time in the book, and who </p>
<p>will serve as the “foundations” for the New Jerusalem in chapter 21; </p>
<p>and second, the prophets, who appeared previously in 10:7; 11:18; and </p>
<p>16:6, and in this book refer to people like John, himself an apostle even </p>
<p>though never designated as one, who speak prophetically into the life </p>
<p>of the church.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>e reason for this combined rejoicing lies with the prophetic an-</p>
<p>nouncement, spoken when Rome was at the height of her glory: For </p>
<p>God has judged her with the judgment she imposed on you. e </p>
<p>“you” in this case, of course, refers to the preceding “people of God” </p>
<p>and their “apostles and prophets,” who are being called upon to rejoice </p>
<p>over Rome’s demise.</p>
<p>e rest of John’s response takes the form of a prophetic symbolic </p>
<p>action,</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>with an accompanying interpretation. To apply a metaphor</p>
<p>from music to John’s literary art, this seems to be a kind of reprise to most </p>
<p>of what has preceded, especially the utter doom of the city, expressed </p>
<p>now in powerful poetry. us the entire scene concludes, appropriately </p>
<p>enough, with a dirge over the demise of Rome. And again, one can only </p>
<p>wonder at the prophetic role John has taken on for himself, not only to </p>
<p>prophesy her coming collapse, but then to sing at her funeral as some-</p>
thing already accomplished in the divine scheme of things.
<p>e symbolic action with which the dirge is introduced is ac-</p>
<p>complished by the third, and last, of the three mighty angels in John’s </p>
<p>narrative.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>e description in this case is almost certainly related to</p>
<p>the angel’s assignment: he picked up a boulder the size of a large </p>
<p>millstone and threw it into the sea. Although the signicance of this </p>
<p>action is not immediately apparent, it becomes so in the process of the </p>
<p>dirge itself. First of all, the “millstone” represents the production of the </p>
<p>most basic foodstu, bread; so then, second, when there are no longer </p>
<p>any workers of any trades le, that means “the sound of a millstone </p>
<p>will never be heard in you again” (v. 23c). At that point, therefore, the </p>
<p>symbolic action and the reality coincide.</p>
<p>19. For an earlier expression of this combination in Paul, see Eph 2:20, thus indi-</p>
<p>cating that this understanding was a common denominator in the early church.</p>
<p>20. Cf., e.g., Jer 13:1–7; Ezek 5:1–4, etc.</p>
<p>21. See on 5:2 and 10:1 above.</p>
