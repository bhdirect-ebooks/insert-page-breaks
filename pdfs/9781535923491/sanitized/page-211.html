<p>Two Interlude Visions</p>

are being assured of their special place in the divine plan. is in turn is
<p>followed by a series of three angelic words (vv. 6–9), which in turn (a) </p>
<p>make a nal pitch for the gospel, (b) announce the fall of “Babylon the </p>
<p>Great,” and (c) oer a nal warning to those who might be tempted to </p>
<p>worship the beast, in case the restrictions imposed on believers (in ch. </p>
<p>13) might cause some to dissemble in this matter.</p>
<p>us, disparate as some of these items may seem, in the narrative </p>
<p>as a whole this material functions in two ways. First, it oers an im-</p>
<p>mediate response to the gruesome realities of chapter 13, reminding </p>
<p>John’s readers that not only had God not forgotten his own, but that in </p>
<p>fact God and Christ are the rulers yet! At the same time, second, the </p>
<p>nal two paragraphs anticipate much of the rest of the book, but in </p>
<p>reverse order, where God’s judgments on evil (chs. 15–20) are followed </p>
<p>by eternal glory for God’s people (chs. 21–22). us, as elsewhere, John </p>
<p>readers on the one hand are being encouraged, while on the other hand </p>
<p>they are being reminded that things will still get worse before they get </p>
<p>better.</p>
<p>e Lamb and the 144,000 (14:1–5)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>en I looked, and there before me was the Lamb, standing on </p>
<p>Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his </p>
<p>Father’s name written on their foreheads. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>And I heard a sound </p>
<p>from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of </p>
<p>thunder. e sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their </p>
<p>harps. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>And they sang a new song before the throne and before </p>
<p>the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the </p>
<p>song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>ese are those who did not dele themselves with women, for </p>
<p>they remained virgins. ey follow the Lamb wherever he goes. </p>
<p>ey were purchased from among the human race and oered </p>
<p>as rstfruits to God and the Lamb. </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>No lie was found in their </p>
<p>mouths; they are blameless.</p>
<p>is paragraph has had as rocky a history of interpretation as any other </p>
<p>in the book, and more than most. e reason for this is not dicult to </p>
<p>nd, since it picks up language—especially numbers—from earlier in </p>
<p>the book, and then seems to deal with them in a considerably dierent </p>
<p>way. Not only so, but one is confronted at the beginning by the con-</p>
<p>tinuing diculty with John’s “geographical” language, since the scene </p>
