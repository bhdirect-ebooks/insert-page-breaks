<p>Revelation 8:6–13</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>e rst angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and </p>
<p>re mixed with blood, and it was hurled down on the earth. A </p>
<p>third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned </p>
<p>up, and all the green grass was burned up.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>e second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a </p>
<p>huge mountain, all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the </p>
<p>sea turned to blood, </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>a third of the living creatures in the sea died, </p>
<p>and a third of the ships were destroyed.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>e third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blaz-</p>
<p>ing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the </p>
<p>springs of water—</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>the name of the star is Wormwood. A third </p>
<p>of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters </p>
<p>that had become bitter.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>e fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun </p>
<p>was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a </p>
<p>third of them turned dark. A third of the day was without light, </p>
<p>and also a third of the night.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>As I watched, I heard an eagle that was ying in midair </p>
<p>call out in a loud voice: “Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the </p>
<p>earth, because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the </p>
<p>other three angels!”</p>
<p>In another remarkable moment in the Apocalypse, John achieves maxi-</p>
<p>mum mileage from his vision of heaven with this next scene, in which </p>
<p>the rst four angels sound their trumpets. It is especially important to </p>
<p>note that this is a continuation from the vision that began in 6:1 and </p>
<p>concluded with 8:1–5, a passage that also served to introduce the next </p>
<p>major section of the narrative. Not only has there been no explicit re-</p>
<p>location of John himself, but as verses 1 and 2 made clear, he is still in </p>
<p>the same vision as in the preceding three chapters. What appears next, </p>
<p>then, is the second of the three sets of seven noted above (p. 90). But in </p>
<p>contrast to the rst set, the nal three items in this one are introduced </p>
<p>by an eagle as three “Woes” (v. 13).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>e most striking feature of these woes is their clear echoing of the </p>
<p>plagues of Egypt recorded in Exodus 7:14—12:30. e reader has just </p>
<p>heard (in 8:5) the theophanic thunderings that echo Exodus 19; now </p>
<p>one is presented with plagues against those who have caused the suf-</p>
<p>fering and hardship among God’s people. And as 9:4 makes clear, those </p>
<p>3. Although the eagle comes on the scene at the end of the fourth woe, its appear-</p>
<p>ance is included in the present discussion because it appears both to conclude the set </p>
<p>of 4 and to introduce the nal set of 3.</p>
