<p>To the Church in Laodicea</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>could create any number of ocular problems, which in turn suggests </p>
<p>that such evocative visual language should be understood for the imag-</p>
<p>ery that it is and not be thought of in more literal terms. e promise to </p>
<p>the victors in this case most likely intends to arm that at the eschato-</p>
<p>logical consummation of things they will share not the right to reign as </p>
<p>such, but will experience as the ultimate privilege of their redemption: </p>
<p>being enthroned as royalty. At the same time one must not miss the </p>
<p>exceptionally high Christology that such language entails—that the Son </p>
<p>and the Father sit on the same throne and thus share equally in the </p>
divine majesty that belongs to God alone.
<p>Finally, one should note that as a conclusion to this letter, and thus </p>
<p>to the letters as a whole, the last word is now the seven-times-repeated </p>
<p>admonition, Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to </p>
<p>the churches. As noted in the discussion of 2:7 above, this reects John’s </p>
<p>Trinitarian understanding of God as Father, Son (see v. 21 above), and </p>
<p>Holy Spirit. Whereas it is Christ who is speaking in each case to the </p>
<p>seven churches, each letter also includes the admonition to “hear what </p>
<p>the Spirit says to the churches.” e very repetition of this admonition, </p>
<p>by which it can begin to fall on deaf ears, is John’s emphatic way of tell-</p>
<p>ing all the churches—then and now—that what God the Father has to </p>
<p>say to the church through Christ the Son is ultimately communicated </p>
<p>through the Spirit, who in Johannine understanding is the Spirit of both </p>
<p>the Father and the Son.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Christ and His Church(es)</p>
<p>Because the letters to the seven churches are the least apocalyptic in the </p>
<p>book, and therefore the most straightforward and understandable, they are </p>
<p>also the most frequently read and applied to the contemporary church(es). </p>
<p>And as with these seven (probably intentionally representative) churches, </p>
<p>the churches in most of Western Christendom also present a similar “mixed </p>
<p>bag.” But it is also important at the outset to note that this section does </p>
<p>not begin at 2:1, since grammatically it is a continuation of the words of </p>
<p>the Risen Christ that began in 1:17. Thus, the real beginning point of the </p>
<p>passage is at 1:9, where John introduces himself and his own situation, and </p>
<p>then moves on to focus altogether on Christ. Therefore, one must avoid the </p>
