<p>Revelation 11:1–14</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>is also the word for “spirit”; thus John is making a deliberate wordplay </p>
<p>on the double reality that life is in the breath, while at the same time </p>
<p>he surely intends that real life for the believer lies with the indwell-</p>
<p>ing Spirit of God. Aer all, the imagery in Ezekiel, taken over by John, </p>
<p>has to do with the eschatological renewal of the people of God by the </p>
<p>Spirit, which the early church found fullled in their own coming to life </p>
<p>through the experience of the Spirit. us, with these words John is of-</p>
<p>fering pregnant imagery both for the resurrection of believers who have </p>
<p>died and for the fact that the life of the believer is wholly dependent on </p>
<p>the indwelling Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>But the imagery does not stop there. When the breath/Spirit of God </p>
<p>“entered them,” John relates, they stood on their feet, with the result </p>
<p>that terror struck those who saw them, referring especially to those </p>
<p>responsible for the death of the two witnesses. As well it might, since </p>
<p>many of “those who saw them” were responsible for the martyrdoms in </p>
<p>the rst place. Most likely this combination of their own “standing” and </p>
<p>“terror striking” those responsible for their maryrdoms is John’s way of </p>
<p>saying that martyrdom does not stamp out true believers. at is, John </p>
<p>is not here picturing many temporal resurrections of believers who are </p>
<p>martyred, but rather is saying in eect that they are God’s people, and </p>
<p>the elimination of some does not bring their witness to an end. To the </p>
<p>contrary, thousands and thousands more will follow in the train of the </p>
<p>martyrs.</p>
e end result of their “resurrection” is divine vindication. us,
<p>besides the “terror [that] struck those who saw” the ones whom God </p>
<p>has revived, the revived themselves then . . . heard another loud voice </p>
<p>from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.” And with that they </p>
<p>went up to heaven in a cloud,</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>while their enemies looked on. At</p>
<p>this point one must allow the apocalyptist the kind of necessary leeway </p>
<p>both to get his point across and to do so with pictures, since with these </p>
<p>nal clauses several separate eschatological realities merge into a single </p>
picture. What seems to be at issue for John is the divine vindication of
<p>the Christian martyrs. us brought together in two brief sentences is </p>
<p>the threefold reality of Christian martyrdom, the eschatological vindi-</p>
<p>cation of the martyrs, and fear on the part of their Roman executioners. </p>
<p>at some of this does not match neatly with other New Testament </p>
<p>41. Since one of these witnesses is Elijah, this appears also to be an echo of an OT </p>
<p>narrative, this time from 2 Kgs 2:11.</p>
