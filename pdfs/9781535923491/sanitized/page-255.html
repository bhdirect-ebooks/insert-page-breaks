<p>Rome as a Seductive Harlot</p>
<p>233</p>
<p>hand, lled with abominable things and the lth of her adulteries. </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>is name written on her forehead was a mystery:</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>BABYLON THE GREAT</p>
<p>THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES</p>
<p>AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God’s </p>
<p>people, the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus. When I </p>
<p>saw her, I was greatly astonished.</p>
<p>e angel’s invitation for John to come and see the punishment God has </p>
<p>in store for the beast begins with this powerful imagery of Rome itself </p>
<p>as an especially high-placed prostitute, a woman whose harlotry could </p>
<p>hardly be likened to that of “street ladies” (hooker, tart, trollop). Rather </p>
<p>here is the kind of prostitute whose “business” is to serve “the best and </p>
<p>the nest,” and at a very high price—an especially tting image for an </p>
<p>Empire into whose services much of the Western world had sold itself, </p>
<p>even though oen with reservations. In order for John to see her, the </p>
<p>angel carried him away in the Spirit into a wilderness. One should </p>
<p>not pass too quickly over two matters in this clause. First, John reminds </p>
<p>his readers of the continuing present activity of the Spirit in the narra-</p>
<p>tive; and second, in this striking moment Rome is pictured as visible </p>
<p>only in “a wilderness,” the place of desolation—and for historic Israel, </p>
<p>of pilgrimage and trial.</p>
<p>What John sees in the wilderness is a woman sitting on a scarlet </p>
<p>beast, the Empire itself thus being pictured as a beast, intentionally tak-</p>
<p>ing the reader back to the imagery of chapter 13. As before, but now in </p>
<p>a dierent order of presentation, the beast was covered with blasphe-</p>
<p>mous names, thus presenting its character, before describing the politi-</p>
<p>cal reality that it had seven heads (again noting its geography). On the </p>
<p>seven heads, and now borrowing directly from Daniel 7:24, were ten </p>
<p>horns. ese are interpreted below (v. 12) as “ten kings who have not </p>
<p>yet received a kingdom,” and who eventually will join in the uprising </p>
<p>to overthrow Rome (v. 16). Next up John describes her character, as </p>
<p>an empire clothed in ultimate luxury. us she was dressed in purple </p>
<p>for royalty and scarlet for her character as a harlot, and was glittering </p>
<p>2. e original NIV read, “is title was written on her forehead: MYSTERY . . . ,” </p>
<p>which seems quite to have missed John’s point.</p>
