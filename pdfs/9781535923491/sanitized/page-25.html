<p>e Revelation as Apocalypse and Prophecy</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>tion of believer’s was the church’s coming collision with the Empire over </p>
<p>who should rightly be proclaimed as “Lord and Savior”—the Roman </p>
<p>emperors or the humble Galilean whom they had crucied, but who </p>
<p>their followers asserted had been raised from the dead.</p>
<p>But the question of whose servants these are, God’s or Christ’s, is </p>
<p>not immediately clear in the Greek text, although the rest of the sentence </p>
<p>seems to make it decisive that the “his” in every case has God as its an-</p>
<p>tecedent. e NIV translators have tried to clarify the issue by making </p>
<p>a new sentence out of John’s second clause. us, he made it known by </p>
<p>sending his angel to his servant John, where the initial “he” can refer </p>
<p>only to God. At the outset, therefore, one learns that God “made” this </p>
<p>revelation “known” to John by way of one of “his angels,” one of the </p>
<p>heavenly beings who throughout the book “shows” John these things, </p>
<p>while John in turn testies (= bears witness) to all that he has been </p>
<p>shown, which John at this point puts in the active: to everything he </p>
<p>saw.</p>
<p>e surprising moment comes at the end of this opening sentence, </p>
<p>where the reader is told that what John “saw” was the word of God </p>
<p>and the testimony of Jesus, a phrase that is as ambiguous in Greek as </p>
<p>it is in English.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>On the basis of its further occurrences in the book,</p>
<p>the rst phrase almost certainly means “the word from God” (= the </p>
<p>word God spoke), which in this case, and in most instances throughout, </p>
<p>primarily comes to John visually. But the second phrase is especially </p>
<p>uncertain, since in what follows it can refer to either the testimony that </p>
<p>Jesus himself had borne through his life, death, and resurrection or to </p>
<p>the testimony that John had borne about Jesus that had brought about </p>
<p>John’s exile on Patmos. While either of these is a possible meaning in </p>
<p>terms of the narrative that follows, both the abbreviated version that </p>
<p>occurs in 6:9 (“the word of God and the testimony they had borne”) and </p>
<p>the present emphasis—which is not on the “life of Christ” per se but on </p>
<p>John’s witness to that life through this book—suggest that the intent </p>
<p>here has to do with John’s own witness that came to him from Christ </p>
<p>himself by way of his angel.</p>
<p>In the nal sentence John further describes this word/testimony </p>
<p>as the words of this prophecy, language which, because of its primary </p>
<p>meaning in English as “the foretelling or prediction of what is to come,” </p>
<p>can be misleading when used in the New Testament. To be sure, there is </p>
<p>2. is phrase recurs in 1:9, and is repeated in reverse order in 20:4.</p>
