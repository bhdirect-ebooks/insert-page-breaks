<p>xv</p>
<p>Lion of the tribe of Judah” (5:5), picking up language from the blessing </p>
<p>of Judah in Genesis 49:10–12 with its promise that “the scepter will not </p>
<p>depart from Judah.” Moreover, the elder who makes this identication </p>
<p>for John then notes that this “Lion from Judah” has “triumphed,” a verb </p>
<p>denoting victory in battle, which makes seventeen of its twenty-eight </p>
<p>New Testament appearances in this book. Nonetheless, when John </p>
<p>turns to see the mighty Lion, all he sees is a Lamb—a “slain Lamb” at </p>
<p>that—the gure that dominates the Revelation until Christ nally ap-</p>
<p>pears as a heavenly warrior (19:11–21).</p>
<p>e role of God’s people is to engage in the Holy War. And herein </p>
<p>lies the heart of the book, because their lot in the war will be one of </p>
<p>suering, which for them is both already present and impending. </p>
Indeed, what makes John a true prophet is that he has divinely been
<p>given insight to recognize that the martyrdom of Antipas of Pergamum </p>
<p>(2:13) was but the forerunner of many more to come. us this theme </p>
<p>pervades the book, beginning with 1:9 (“I John, your brother and </p>
<p>companion in the suering”) and repeated several times in the letters </p>
<p>to the seven churches (2:3; 2:8–9; 2:13; 3:10), while each of the letters </p>
<p>concludes with the verb for “triumph” noted above (NIV, “those who </p>
<p>are victorious”).</p>
<p>Furthermore, one of key passages early on in the book is 6:9–11, </p>
<p>where the h seal when opened reveals “the souls of those who had </p>
<p>been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had </p>
<p>maintained.” is is followed in 7:14 with the great multitude in white </p>
<p>robes who “have come out of the great tribulation,” and who now ap-</p>
<p>pear in heaven “before the throne of God,” where they are promised </p>
<p>no more suering (vv. 16–17). e same thing happens again in the </p>
<p>opening visions of the second half of the book (12:11 and 17), where </p>
<p>their suering and death is linked to their “holding fast their testimony </p>
<p>about Jesus.” en, in the rest of this half of the book (chs. 13–22) their </p>
<p>suering and death are specically attributed to the Empire itself (“the </p>
<p>beast”).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>is motif is the obvious key to understanding the historical </p>
<p>context of the book, and fully explains its occasion and purpose. John </p>
<p>himself is in exile, apparently for his faith; others are at the same time </p>
<p>experiencing various degrees of suering. John has the prophetic in-</p>
<p>1. See, for example, 13:7, 10; 14:12–13; 16:5–6; 18:20, 24; 19:2; and 20:4.</p>
