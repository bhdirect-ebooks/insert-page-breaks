<p>The Seven Bowls of God’s Wrath </p>
<p>As the story in the Revelation unfolds—and is brought to its climax in </p>
<p>chapters 17–22—it becomes clear that John has two ultimate concerns: </p>
<p>God’s judgment of Satan and his followers (chs. 19–20), and the nal </p>
<p>salvation of God’s people (chs. 21–22). With chapters 15 and 16 one </p>
<p>comes to the penultimate concern in the story, God’s judgment of the </p>
<p>church’s present satanic enemy, the Roman Empire and its emperors, </p>
<p>pictured as two beasts in chapter 13. is judgment will be further </p>
<p>spelled out with a variety of images in chapters 17–19. But in typical </p>
<p>fashion, these nal judgments against the Empire, which are given in </p>
<p>chapter 16, are rst solemnly introduced with a vision of heaven (ch. </p>
<p>15). us, just as the vision of the seven trumpets (8:6—9:21) was intro-</p>
<p>duced by the imagery of “reversed thunder” in 8:1–5 as God’s response </p>
<p>to the prayers of the saints, so here the last seven plagues are introduced </p>
<p>with a twofold heavenly vision. At the same time John continues to pick </p>
<p>up echoes from what has preceded, while setting the whole once again </p>
<p>in the context of the rst exodus (most oen pictured in this book as </p>
<p>another return from Babylon, thus the “second exodus”).</p>
<p>e present vision comes in two parts, corresponding to the </p>
<p>chapter-and-verse numbering of our Bibles. ese are (again) intro-</p>
<p>duced rst with “I saw” (15:1) and then with “I heard” (16:1). e in-</p>
<p>troduction itself comes by way of a twofold heavenly vision, both parts </p>
<p>of which anticipate the judgments that follow. In 15:1–4, with several </p>
<p>echoes from 14:1–5, the redeemed and victorious martyrs sing again, </p>
<p>this time “the song of Moses the servant of God, and of the Lamb,” a </p>
<p>song that basically exalts God and extols God’s justice. With 15:5–8 one </p>
<p>can now make better sense of (what appeared to be) the strange conclu-</p>
<p>sion to chapter 11, where heaven opened exposing a visible ark of the </p>
<p>covenant, plus an earthquake that included a great hailstorm. Here the </p>
<p>scene shis slightly, as the “ark” is now pictured as a “temple,” out of </p>
<p>which come the seven angels with the last seven plagues.</p>
