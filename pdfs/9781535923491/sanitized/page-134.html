<p>Revelation 7:9–17</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>of specicity on his part is also the origin of the term “Palm Sunday,” as </p>
<p>the language is not found in any of the other Gospels. us even though </p>
<p>Psalm 118:26–27 says only “with boughs in hand,” John had chosen to </p>
<p>specify what kind of “boughs” were involved; and this is now carried </p>
<p>over to the nal triumphal moment in heaven itself, of which the earthly </p>
<p>entry by Christ was but a precursor. us the entire redeemed heavenly </p>
<p>multitude are not only dressed appropriately (in “white robes”), they </p>
<p>also carry “in their hands” the celebratory “palm branches.”</p>
<p>More signicantly still, this “great multitude” cried out in a loud </p>
<p>voice (the redeemed will be a truly noisy lot!), and the content of their </p>
<p>shout brings the reader back to the reality noted at the beginning in </p>
1:4–6, that the Father and Son share all of the divine privileges that
<p>historically had belonged to the One God of Israel. Also, as in 1:5, the </p>
<p>emphasis on their shared equality has primarily to do with human </p>
<p>“salvation.” us their song at this point is singular and is directed alto-</p>
<p>gether toward the one thing the great multitude have in common.</p>
<p>us most signicantly, and still echoing Psalm 118:19–27, they </p>
<p>sing not as in the psalm, (“Lord, save us!” v. 27); rather “they cry out,” </p>
<p>as something fully realized, salvation belongs to our God, who sits on </p>
<p>the throne. us nally, John states explicitly what no one could have </p>
<p>missed before: that “the one who sits enthroned” is none other than the </p>
<p>living God, who is here identied as “our God,” meaning the God who </p>
<p>has taken us for his own and through Christ has redeemed us. ere is, </p>
<p>of course, no other God; but John’s language puts emphasis on the fact </p>
<p>that in making the redeemed God’s own people, they in turn acclaim </p>
<p>God as “our God.” But in the new perspective brought about by Christ’s </p>
<p>death and resurrection, the acclamation concludes, and to the Lamb. </p>
<p>Here is what makes John’s Revelation an altogether Christian book, as </p>
<p>Father and Son are together worshiped as the one God.</p>
<p>What happens next in John’s narrative intentionally echoes the </p>
<p>scenes in chapters 4 and 5, and is typically Johannine in that worship </p>
<p>and praise precede all heavenly explanations. e setting is still the </p>
<p>same, as are the heavenly personae. us John moves from the “great </p>
<p>multitude” of the redeemed to the primary heavenly host themselves, </p>
<p>all the angels, who as before (5:11b) are pictured as standing around </p>
<p>the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. ese </p>
<p>are the original heavenly host who now encircle “the great multitude of </p>
<p>the redeemed.” But though part of the heavenly entourage, they are not </p>
