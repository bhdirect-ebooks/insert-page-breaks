<p>Revelation 13:1–18</p>
<p>182</p>
<p>language “allowed him,” of course, is not in the text itself; but the im-</p>
<p>plication of the series of passive verbs suggests both that the power was </p>
<p>not inherent to the beast but rather came to him from Satan, while at </p>
<p>the same time it implies that the beast’s time has been set ultimately by </p>
<p>God and not by merely human power or ingenuity. e beast’s power by </p>
<p>way of abusive words is then partly repeated in the next sentence, where </p>
<p>John notes specically that the beast opened its mouth to blaspheme </p>
<p>God. is in turn evolves into a threefold slander against God: against </p>
<p>God’s name; against heaven, God’s dwelling place; and against those </p>
<p>who live in heaven, referring in this latter case to the angelic host. It </p>
<p>is this recognition of the clear relationship between the power of the </p>
<p>Empire and Satan’s activities that makes John such a truly Christian </p>
<p>prophet.</p>
<p>But the ultimate reason for all of this lies with the next sentence </p>
<p>(v. 7), and the astute reader should once again observe the set of pas-</p>
<p>sives. On the one hand, it was given power to make war against God’s </p>
<p>people and to conquer them, where the passive voice of the verb once </p>
<p>more implies that its power was not inherent to its nature as a beast, but </p>
<p>to the twofold reality that the power came from Satan (v. 2b) and was </p>
<p>allowed by God. At the same time, and now reecting on the actualities </p>
<p>of history, it was given authority over every tribe, people, language </p>
<p>and nation.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>And again, this is a truly biblical view of history, that the</p>
<p>Empire became powerful through the work of Satan, and because God </p>
<p>allowed it.</p>
<p>e climax of all this is that just as God the Father receives glory </p>
<p>as his true children worship God the Son, so in this case the dragon </p>
<p>receives his perverse glory as all the inhabitants of the earth . . . wor-</p>
<p>ship the beast. However, so as not to include God’s own people among </p>
<p>“all the inhabitants of the earth,” John concludes by excluding them, </p>
<p>but does so by describing the others negatively: all whose names have </p>
<p>not been written in the Lamb’s book of life. And again, to accentuate </p>
<p>the One who has the real power, power that appears as mere weakness </p>
<p>to the world, John further concludes, the Lamb who was slain from </p>
<p>the creation of the world. Although this latter phrase may seem quite </p>
<p>normal to some readers, it is in fact the rst of its only two occurrences </p>
<p>in the book (here and in 17:8). And a most remarkable theological mo-</p>
<p>20. On this recurring list see p. 85, n. 24.</p>
