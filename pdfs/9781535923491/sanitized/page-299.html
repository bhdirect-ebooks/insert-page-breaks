<p>e Last Battle, Part 1: e Battle Itself</p>
<p>277</p>
<p>en, reaching back to the proleptic imagery presented at the end </p>
<p>of chapter 14 (vv. 17–20), John concludes his description of Christ the </p>
divine warrior by announcing that he treads the winepress of the fury
<p>of the wrath of God Almighty. With these words Christ is now identi-</p>
<p>ed as bringing fulllment to Isaiah 63:3:</p>
<p>I have trodden the winepress alone;</p>
<p> from the nations no one was with me.</p>
<p> I trampled them in my anger</p>
<p> and trod them down in my wrath;</p>
<p> their blood spattered my garments,</p>
<p> and I stained all my clothing.</p>
<p>Many people, especially those who live in democratic societies, nd </p>
<p>this language very dicult to handle with regard to a God of love and </p>
<p>mercy. But a God who simply tolerated evil would hardly be a God </p>
<p>of love at all. Righteousness and justice call for a proper recompense </p>
<p>on evil doers, especially so of the propagators of such intense evil and </p>
<p>slaughter of the innocent that was to be the Rome of the second and </p>
<p>third centuries. And in the present case John will not allow his readers </p>
<p>to mistake who it is who carries out this judgment; thus the present de-</p>
<p>scriptor is followed by the ultimate identier, namely, that on his robe </p>
<p>and on his thigh he has this name written: KING OF KINGS AND </p>
<p>LORD OF LORDS, thereby recalling the remarkable moment in the </p>
<p>imagery of 17:14 where the Lamb will triumph over the Empire and its </p>
<p>minions “because he is Lord of lords and King of kings.”</p>
<p>Finally, one should note that this description of Christ as the di-</p>
<p>vine warrior takes up almost half of the narrative of the Last Battle,</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p>thus indicating where John’s own interests, and therefore emphases, lie. </p>
<p>What follows is rst an invitation to the carrion-eating birds to gather </p>
<p>in anticipation of the defeat of the beast and the kings of the earth (vv. </p>
<p>17–18), and second, a description not so much of the battle itself but </p>
<p>of its outcome (vv. 19–21). It is of interest to note that in this second </p>
<p>half of the picture, where the concern is altogether with the demise of </p>
<p>the evil triumvirate (the beast, the false prophet, the kings of the earth), </p>
<p>Christ is now mentioned sparingly, but at the three crucial moments: as </p>
<p>the one against whom they make war (v. 19), as the one who captures </p>
<p>8. In the Greek this paragraph comes in 17 lines of text, while the rest of the nar-</p>
<p>rative has 20.</p>
