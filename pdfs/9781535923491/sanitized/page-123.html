<p>e Opening of the First Six Seals</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>disappeared, nally the heavens themselves receded like a scroll, thus </p>
<p>appearing to have been rolled up. e nal apocalyptic description </p>
<p>has to do with the earth itself, so that every mountain and island was </p>
<p>removed from its place. All of this, one must remember, is the direct </p>
<p>result of the earthquake John witnessed; and along with John one must </p>
<p>visualize, not take it literally, since in the next sentence everyone . . . </p>
<p>hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains.</p>
<p>is latter point needs to be made because in the nal scene the </p>
<p>mountains exist both as a place in which people can hide and as a </p>
<p>preferred source of judgment, as over against a source of panic. us </p>
<p>what follows is a description of the entire human populace seeking to </p>
escape divine judgment by hiding “in caves and among the rocks of the
<p>mountains.”</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>John begins his description of the human populace at the</p>
<p>top, as it were, and works his way down from the tyrants to the populace </p>
<p>itself. us he begins with the rulers, the kings of the earth (cf. 18:3)</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and the princes, who are most likely to be understood as the emperor </p>
<p>and all his subordinate rulers in the various provinces, who were either </p>
<p>under direct Roman rule (as was Judea) or indirect rule through a local </p>
<p>“king” (as was Galilee). ese are followed by two other specic groups </p>
<p>of people in positions of power: the generals and the rich. ese are </p>
<p>then followed by the designation the mighty, which in this case is prob-</p>
<p>ably best understood as a nal catch-all term, functioning very much </p>
<p>the way “et cetera” does in English. Following these various forms of </p>
<p>“the mighty,” John nally includes everyone else, both slave and free; </p>
<p>and with this he has simply included all of the known human race that </p>
<p>made up the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>e various people themselves prefer the indirect judgment of the </p>
<p>destruction by the rocks and mountains rather than a direct encounter </p>
<p>with God and Christ. But their place of refuge in “caves and among </p>
<p>the rocks of the mountains” is recognized as inadequate in the face of </p>
<p>such a cataclysmic earthquake, which is to be understood by all as an </p>
expression of divine judgment. In describing their panic, John bor-
<p>rows language from Hosea 10:8,</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>describing their plight as a yet future</p>
<p>43. Language that clearly echoes Isa 2:10, 19, and 21.</p>
<p>44. John’s language here echoes (is borrowed from?) Ps 2:2: “the kings of the earth </p>
<p>rise up . . . against the Lord and against his anointed.”</p>
<p>45. e Hosea text reads, “ey will say to the mountains, ‘Cover us!’ and to the </p>
<p>hills, ‘Fall on us!’”</p>
