<p>e Seventh Trumpet: Conclusion to the Introductory Vision</p>
<p>159</p>
<p>But since this thanksgiving on the part of the twenty-four elders </p>
<p>is equally about God’s judgment on the wicked, the Roman Empire and </p>
<p>its minions who are faithful to it in its idolatry and persecution of God’s </p>
<p>people, John concludes with the especially powerful language, and for </p>
<p>destroying those who destroy the earth. While this is an understand-</p>
<p>able way of putting it, John is not here referring to “earth keeping” as </p>
<p>such, but to the larger understanding of the reason God placed human-</p>
<p>kind on this planet: to both “ll [KJV “replenish”] the earth and subdue </p>
<p>it” (Gen 1:28). From the biblical perspective the earth does not exist </p>
<p>either for its own sake or for God’s own sake, but as the “temple” in </p>
<p>which people are to live under God’s sovereign rule and grace.</p>
<p>Finally, in response to the way those whom God has created have </p>
<p>treated his creation, especially since they themselves have been created </p>
in the diving image, the heavenly counterpart of God’s temple, the earth
<p>itself, responds accordingly. us, God’s temple in heaven was opened, </p>
<p>and within his temple was seen the ark of his covenant,</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>which seems</p>
<p>to be John’s way here, as elsewhere, of tying the two covenants together. </p>
<p>e surprising element here is the imagery “God’s temple in heaven </p>
<p>was opened.” “What temple?” one wants to ask; but then it must be </p>
<p>remembered that this is imagery, aer all, not photography; and the </p>
<p>temple is always for the believing Jew the place of the Divine Presence, </p>
<p>thus such language is altogether appropriate in an apocalyptic descrip-</p>
<p>tion of heaven. at this is imagery, pure and simple, is made certain </p>
<p>by one of the concluding words in the entire narrative: “I did not see a </p>
<p>temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its </p>
<p>temple” (21:22).</p>
<p>Finally, and typical of such theophanies both in this book and </p>
<p>elsewhere where, God is not/cannot be described; the Divine Presence </p>
<p>is indicated by what later peoples came to refer to as “acts of God.” And </p>
<p>as before in this narrative, the response to the opening of the “temple </p>
<p>in heaven” was both in heaven and on earth. From heaven there came </p>
<p>ashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder. Anyone who has </p>
<p>experienced this kind of storm in mid-America will recognize how well </p>
<p>this describes what happens in a thunderstorm; one rst sees the “light-</p>
<p>ning,” which is followed momentarily (depending on the distance) by </p>
<p>“rumblings,” which then yield to loud claps of “thunder.” is is then </p>
<p>45. is, of course, reects the OT reality, marked historically in 1 Kgs 8:6.</p>
