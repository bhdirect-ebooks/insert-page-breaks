<p>Revelation 4–6</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>e heavenly scene, however, is not what the book is all about; </p>
<p>rather it sets the stage for the reader’s understanding of what is about </p>
<p>to take place on earth. at story is introduced in preview fashion in </p>
<p>chapter 6. It is a story of conquest, war, famine and death, resulting in </p>
<p>Christian martyrdoms (seal 5), which will be eventually responded to </p>
by divine judgment (seal 6).
<p>It is especially important for the reader to recognize that the cor-</p>
<p>responding heavenly scenes of chapters 4 and 5 are not intended to be </p>
<p>understood within the time frame of human history as such. at is, </p>
<p>despite the temptation that many have had to read verse 1b otherwise, </p>
<p>John is not here oering his readers “the beginning of the End,” as it </p>
<p>were—except in a secondary sense in part 3 (our ch. 6). Rather, this </p>
<p>vision functions as the second key element in the larger narrative. us, </p>
<p>rst, there are the churches among whom the risen Christ walks (chs. </p>
<p>2–3); this is the view from below—what was happening right then on </p>
<p>planet earth. e present vision, second, is to be understood as simul-</p>
<p>taneous with what has preceded. Here the readers are given a view </p>
<p>from above, the eternal context in which they are to understand their </p>
<p>own present existence, and in light of which they are to understand </p>
<p>everything that follows. e contrasts, therefore, are simultaneously </p>
<p>dramatic—heaven and earth seen in light of each other—and awesome, </p>
<p>calling for worship. Finally, one must not forget that chapter 6 is the </p>
<p>conclusion of the present vision. is, too, is reality, but reality that one </p>
<p>can make sense of only in light of the present scene.</p>
<p>Finally by way of introduction, and perhaps above everything else, </p>
<p>one must be warned not to stoop to unthoughtful literalism while read-</p>
<p>ing chapters 4 and 5. Rather, children of the Enlightenment though we </p>
<p>are, we must do our best to let the visions speak to our imaginations—</p>
<p>to take our breath away, as it were, and thus to give one theological </p>
<p>perspective from which to see what comes next in chapter 6, not to </p>
<p>mention our own present existence. us what follows will rst of all be </p>
<p>commentary, as one works his or her way through the whole to see how </p>
<p>the various parts work and what they are pointing to; but at the end </p>
<p>of the day one must join the heavenly host in worship, or John’s whole </p>
<p>reason for writing may get lost in the pursuit of details.</p>
