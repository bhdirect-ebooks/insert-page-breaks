<p>Fusing the Horizons: e Original Tale of Two Cities</p>

<p>elite, and thus the original “scarlet woman.” The other is pictured as a bride </p>
<p>on her wedding day, dressed in pure white awaiting her husband-to-be.</p>
<p>Thus at the end of his Revelation John offers his readers, who are </p>
<p>about to endure the wrath of the Empire, the ultimate imagery of a city </p>
<p>whose splendor is designed to appeal to one’s imagination. Its dimensions </p>
<p>taken literally exceed all human possibilities or expectations; and its con-</p>
<p>struction of gold, pearls, and other precious stones is designed to excite the </p>
<p>imagination. But in the end all of that has an ultimate, singular focus. It is </p>
<p>the palace of all palaces, that of the Great King, the God of creation and </p>
<p>redemption; thus it is the inheritance of God’s own people, those who have </p>
<p>been freed from their sins by the blood of the Lamb and born of the Spirit.</p>
<p>In contrast to all such earthly palaces, this one exists not for kings and </p>
<p>nobles as such, but for all of God’s people. Thus it is the ﬁnal dwelling place </p>
<p>of the once impoverished and needy, those who have come to recognize their </p>
<p>impoverishment and have trusted in God’s mercy as offered to them through </p>
<p>the death and resurrection of the Son. The city itself is an eternal temple, a </p>
<p>place of joy and worship and becoming who we were intended to be at the </p>
<p>outset. Hence it is both Eden restored and Jerusalem reconstructed—the </p>
<p>eternal garden of God which is also the eternal temple of God.</p>
<p>Nonetheless all of that is secondary to the fact that it is the dwelling </p>
<p>of the Great King, the one and only God—Father, Son and Spirit—and as </p>
<p>such is the ﬁnal dwelling of all the King’s children, those who as the old </p>
<p>children’s song has it are “red and yellow, black and white, they are precious </p>
<p>in his sight.” Here all the things that have separated us as human beings—</p>
<p>race, nationality, gender, profession—exist no longer as barriers. Here the </p>
<p>dead will have been raised to life eternal, and “time” itself is swallowed up </p>
<p>by eternity, which is time-less.</p>
<p>Here also is the place where our tendency to crass literalism must </p>
<p>give way to an expectation of glory that simply lies beyond all known hu-</p>
<p>man comprehension. The imagery must be allowed to have its way, as one </p>
<p>contemplates a restored earth, living in restored bodies, eternally in the </p>
<p>Divine Presence. To image this John gives us gold and precious stones, but </p>
<p>at the end we must trust that the reality is inﬁnitely greater and grander </p>
<p>than anything the imagination can produce. No wonder John concludes his </p>
<p>book with an “Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!”</p>
