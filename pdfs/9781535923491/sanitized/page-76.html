<p>Revelation 3:7–13</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>One against a community that should have received its Messiah with </p>
<p>open arms, but failed to do so.</p>
<p>e third promise (v. 10) comes as the apodosis (the “then” clause) </p>
<p>of a sentence that begins, Since you have kept my command to endure </p>
<p>patiently. is armation is a tting protasis for the promise that fol-</p>
<p>lows: I will also keep you from the coming hour of trial. us the </p>
<p>opening commendation for having “kept my word and . . . not denied </p>
<p>my name” now has this singular further elaboration: the believers in </p>
<p>Philadelphia “have kept my command to endure patiently.” In many </p>
<p>ways this is an especially revealing moment in the book. Aer all, it is </p>
<p>part of the larger Johannine picture that Christ’s disciples are expected </p>
<p>to “keep his word,” that is, to obey the commands that he gave his dis-</p>
<p>ciples when he walked among them. But here, in a context where perse-</p>
<p>cution is both hovering over them and in some cases already begun, the </p>
<p>singular elaboration of keeping Christ’s word has to do with not denying </p>
<p>Christ in the hour of intense trial that is about to descend.</p>
<p>Of further interest, but also of further diculty for understanding </p>
<p>from our distance, is the additional elaboration of the coming “hour of </p>
<p>trial,” that it is going to come upon the whole world to test those who </p>
<p>live on the earth. What John himself understood by this clause is a sin-</p>
<p>gular mystery. On the one hand, it is fully in keeping with the warnings </p>
<p>of Jesus found in the Gospels;</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> on the other hand, the present phras-</p>
<p>ing of this motif leaves the later reader with only guesses. Is this to be </p>
<p>understood as a temporal event, soon to take place in the period of this </p>
<p>writing? Or is it a more purely eschatological event, a way of describing </p>
<p>the days preceding the coming of our Lord? Furthermore, in this par-</p>
<p>ticular case the readers are promised they will be to be “kept from” this </p>
<p>hour of trial. Does this mean to be delivered from it altogether when </p>
<p>it comes? Or does it mean to be kept secure by Christ even during its </p>
<p>most intense expression? At this point, and as is oen true with other </p>
<p>such eschatological moments in the New Testament, we have little cer-</p>
<p>tainty about the when, and not total certainty about the what itself. at </p>
<p>is, even though one can be sure from this passage that Christ intends to </p>
<p>keep his own from this hour of trial, at this distance we simply can have </p>
<p>no certainty as to the specics of the event itself.</p>
<p>26. See, e.g., the “apocalyptic discourse” in Mark 13 (esp. vv. 14–25) and the paral-</p>
<p>lels in Matt 24 and Luke 21.</p>
