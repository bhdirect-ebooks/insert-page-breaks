<p>258</p>
<p>sea captain), which is then followed not by the sailors themselves, but </p>
<p>still with focus on Rome itself: all who travel by ship. en come the </p>
<p>sailors, and all others who earn their living from the sea (stevedores, </p>
<p>dock workers of various kinds, shipping agents, etc.).</p>
<p>In their case, however, even though they begin by exclaiming, Was </p>
<p>there ever a city like this great city?, the mourning is altogether a mat-</p>
<p>ter of self interest. us, even though they go through the traditional </p>
<p>process of mourning by throwing dust on their heads, echoing Ezekiel </p>
<p>27:30,</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>and crying out as before, Woe! Woe to you, great city, their</p>
<p>weeping is over the demise of all who had ships on the sea, who had </p>
<p>become rich through her wealth. e reason for their lament, as with </p>
<p>those before them, is that in one hour she has been brought to ruin!</p>
<p>us concludes the laments over the burning of Rome; but at the </p>
<p>end the reader should note again the combination of John’s (a) splitting </p>
<p>the “merchants of the earth” into two parts, those who make their living </p>
<p>on the land and on the sea; (b) framing the whole with the long center-</p>
<p>piece describing the twenty-eight cargoes with its relentless monotony; </p>
<p>and (c) saving the description of the relationship of the seafarers to the </p>
<p>city as the nal, instead of the rst, word in the lament. Together these </p>
<p>pretty well tell the story of this long oracle: God is going to judge Rome </p>
<p>in part because, like ancient Tyre, she is using her dominance of the </p>
<p>sea, now with the protection of the imperial armies, to set in motion </p>
<p>a lifestyle that is utterly over against the living God, both in terms of </p>
<p>God’s essential character and God’s self-revelation as the protector of </p>
<p>the poor. is in turn is what makes sense of the sudden, totally unex-</p>
<p>pected response by John that comes next.</p>
<p>e Johannine Response (18:20–24)</p>
<p>John’s own response to the predicted fall of the “great city,” and thus of </p>
<p>its Empire, takes two forms: rst, as a call to the entire people of God, </p>
<p>both in heaven and on earth, to “rejoice” over this event; and second, </p>
<p>with a prophetic symbolic action. e latter is carried out by yet another </p>
<p>angel, who then sings a funeral dirge over “the great city of Babylon.”</p>
<p>18. us, “they will raise their voice and cry bitterly over you; they will sprinkle </p>
<p>dust on their heads and roll in ashes.” For this practice elsewhere in the OT, see Josh </p>
<p>7:6 and Lam 2:10.</p>
