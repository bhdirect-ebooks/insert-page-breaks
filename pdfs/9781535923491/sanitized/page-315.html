<p>Introduction: A New Heaven and a New Earth</p>

<p>84 make plain, it was God’s presence in the temple that drew them to </p>
<p>Jerusalem. In so doing they were echoing the plaintive cry of Moses, </p>
<p>“If your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here” </p>
<p>(Exodus 33:15). us what John heard next was a loud voice from the </p>
<p>throne [although not God’s own voice yet] saying, “Look! God’s dwell-</p>
<p>ing place is now among his people.” is in turn is further elaborated, </p>
<p>He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, which further </p>
<p>reects the words of Moses (that God’s presence is what distinguishes </p>
<p>God’s people from all other peoples on the earth). us John concludes, </p>
<p>still echoing Moses, God himself will be with them and be their </p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>ese various clauses and phrases together reect an Old Testament </p>
<p>theme that emerges rst in Leviticus 26:11–12 (“I will put my dwelling-</p>
<p>place among you; . . . I will walk among you and be your God and </p>
<p>you will be my people”), and then in the Prophets (“Shout and be glad, </p>
<p>Daughter Zion; for I am coming, and I will live among you,” Zechariah </p>
<p>2:10; “My dwelling place will be with them; I will be their God, and </p>
<p>they will be my people,” Ezekiel 37:27–28). In keeping with this Old </p>
<p>Testament motif, John now sees “the Holy City, the new Jerusalem” as </p>
<p>“coming down out of heaven from God.”</p>
<p>e voice then goes on to describe the benets of the eternal God </p>
<p>being “their God.” First, God eliminates all present sorrow. Using the </p>
<p>prophet’s language from Isaiah 25:8, John now adds, He will wipe </p>
<p>every tear from their eyes, thereby also picking up the promise from </p>
<p>7:17 above. To this is added, from the beginning of the same passage </p>
<p>in Isaiah, there will be no more death,</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>to which John further adds,</p>
<p>or mourning or crying or pain, now echoing Isaiah 35:10 (“sorrow </p>
<p>and sighing will ee away”).</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>e ultimate glory of “heaven,” therefore,</p>
<p>is not its physical features, which will be described in some detail in </p>
<p>the next part of the vision, but lies with the fact that human sorrow is </p>
<p>banished forever, because the old order of things has passed away. </p>
<p>Although it is dicult for earthlings like ourselves to comprehend the </p>
<p>full nature of such an existence, the attraction of it lies at the very heart </p>
<p>of what it means for us to be human: life without pain and weeping (no </p>
<p>more funerals, if you will!).</p>
<p>3. Isa 25:7–8 reads “On this mountain . . . he will swallow up death forever; the </p>
<p>Sovereign Lord will wipe away the tears from their faces.”</p>
<p>4. Cf. also Isa 65:19: “the sound of weeping and of crying will be heard in </p>
<p>[Jerusalem] no more.”</p>
