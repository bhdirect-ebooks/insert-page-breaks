<p>expressions of these realities that come in straight prose should not be a </p>
<p>problem for the reader. is is apocalyptic eschatology, aer all, which </p>
<p>is intended, by way of vivid pictures, to stress the realities as such, not </p>
<p>to oer a literal timeline of events. Unfortunately, much of the ability to </p>
<p>imagine on the part of contemporary readers has been lost as the direct </p>
<p>result of so much such imagery being oered on the silver screen and </p>
<p>the television set. But these words were written to people without our </p>
<p>visual media available to them, so the imagination of John’s contempo-</p>
<p>rary reader is le to thrive on its own through the pictures aorded by </p>
<p>the words themselves.</p>
<p>at verbal imagery addressed to the reader’s imagination is John’s </p>
<p>intent seems to be made certain by his conclusion to the present scene, </p>
which takes the form of divine judgment on those responsible for the
<p>slaughter of believers. As with all that has preceded it in the vision, this </p>
<p>word of judgment (in our v. 13) is not here a word about the nal judg-</p>
<p>ment itself; rather it speaks of the temporal judgment meted out within </p>
<p>history on those in the Empire responsible for the holocaust. First, at </p>
<p>that very hour [meaning at the time of God’s judgment] there was a </p>
<p>severe earthquake, whose result was that a tenth of the city [Rome] </p>
<p>collapsed. us whatever was intended ultimately by the imagery of “a </p>
<p>tenth of the city,” minimally it points to a temporal, not eternal judg-</p>
<p>ment. Second, seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake. </p>
<p>Again, this language carries symbolic signicance, pointing both to the </p>
immensity (“seven thousand”) and to the divine nature (the passive
<p>“were killed”) of the judgment. Understandably, and a phenomenon re-</p>
<p>peated more than once in human history, the survivors were terried </p>
<p>and gave glory to the God of heaven (cf. Jonah 1:16). What John does </p>
<p>not intend by these words is that the “survivors” became converts; rath-</p>
<p>er, in giving “glory to the God of heaven” they are acknowledging God’s </p>
divine majesty and power; but that falls several leagues short of oering
<p>themselves to the living—and only—God as obedient servants.</p>
<p>With that acknowledgment of God’s sovereignty, John’s present </p>
<p>purposes have been served, so he concludes by noting (v. 14) that the </p>
<p>second woe has passed; the third woe is coming soon. At the same </p>
<p>time, however, he leaves the later reader guessing, since there is no </p>
<p>mention of a “third woe” as such in the narrative that follows. In any </p>
<p>case, by indicating that “the second woe has passed” and that a “third” is </p>
<p>coming soon, John indicates at the conclusion of the rst two woes that </p>
