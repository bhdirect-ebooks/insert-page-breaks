<p>Revelation 18:1—19:10</p>
<p>250</p>
<p>from her goes up for ever and ever”). ese two expressions of judg-</p>
<p>ment together picture a city under siege, where famine and death pre-</p>
<p>cede capture and the leveling of the city into ashes. en, in a fashion </p>
<p>also typical of Israel’s prophetic tradition, all of this is seen as having </p>
divine origins: for mighty is the Lord God who judges her, where God
<p>the Father, whose “might” is armed only here in the Revelation, is </p>
<p>once more designated as “the Lord God,” as at the beginning in 1:8 and </p>
<p>again in 4:8.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>From our distance it is easy for the reader to move too quickly </p>
<p>from the warning for God’s people to ee, to the laments themselves, </p>
<p>without taking the necessary moment to pause and recognize the </p>
<p>sheer glory, not to mention audacity, of this moment. is dirge over </p>
<p>Rome’s fall, one needs to be reminded, was spoken when Rome was </p>
<p>at the absolute height of its power, and had begun to call herself “the </p>
<p>Eternal City.” Her armies had both created her and secured her place </p>
<p>of absolute dominion over the Mediterranean world and beyond. Yet </p>
<p>here is an elderly Jewish follower of the Slain Lamb, himself in exile on </p>
<p>a semi-barren Aegean island, now facing west and singing a dirge over </p>
<p>the Empire. is is in fact the kind of stu of which the entire prophetic </p>
<p>tradition of the Old Testament was made; and this is the kind of passage </p>
<p>that secures John’s own place among the prophets of Israel. Here indeed </p>
<p>is the prophetic word of judgment on those who basically live o the </p>
<p>backs of others, even as the latter “serve” their everyday needs.</p>
<p>reefold Woe over Babylon’s Fall (18:9–20)</p>
<p>In yet another truly prophetic moment, following hard on the heels of </p>
<p>the former one, John proceeds to carry out the most audacious act of </p>
<p>all, not only pronouncing judgment on Rome as such, but following </p>
<p>that with a series of “woes” cried out by the three groups who have the </p>
<p>most to lose when she is “consumed by re” (v. 8): the “kings of the </p>
<p>earth” (v. 9), the “merchants of the earth” (v. 11), and the merchant </p>
<p>marine (v. 17b), who in John’s language includes “every sea captain, . . . </p>
<p>the sailors, and all who earn their living from the sea.” As noted above, </p>
<p>there is scarcely an apocalyptic moment in this entire passage; every-</p>
<p>thing is straightforward, echoing the style and language of the prophets </p>
<p>13. is language also echoes Jer 50:34, where the prophet declares, “Yet their </p>
<p>Redeemer is strong; the LORD Almighty is his name.”</p>
