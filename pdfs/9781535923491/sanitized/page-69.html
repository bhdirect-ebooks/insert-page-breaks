<p>To the Church in Sardis</p>

<p>entails; perhaps, just like their city, they are living on their past reputa-</p>
<p>tion. Indeed, anybody visiting either the city or the church would think </p>
<p>it vigorous and alive, but in both cases that is mostly illusion.</p>
<p>In the case of the church, this probably also represents subtle ac-</p>
<p>commodation to the culture (as in yatira). As someone put it well, </p>
<p>“they are a perfect model of inoensive Christianity”—not lukewarm, </p>
<p>as Laodicea, but looking very much alive, while in fact they are stone </p>
<p>dead. is now also makes sense of the designation of Christ as the one </p>
<p>“who holds the seven spirits of God,” which oers further evidence in </p>
<p>support of the view that this term is symbolic for the Holy Spirit. is </p>
<p>is especially so for Johannine Christianity, since for him the Spirit is </p>
<p>clearly the giver of life; and what has been lost in Sardis is the life that </p>
<p>the Spirit alone brings.</p>
<p>is accounts for the warning, which the NIV has rendered “wake </p>
<p>up.” Although this is good colloquial English, John’s words are liter-</p>
<p>ally “become watchful.” Aer all, the imagery is not that of people who </p>
<p>are sleeping, but of those who appear to be alert yet in fact are quite </p>
<p>unaware of their desperate situation. ey are totally without compre-</p>
<p>hension as to their own condition, including their present total inef-</p>
<p>fectiveness in Sardis; nor do they have a clue about the real threat that </p>
<p>stands on the horizon in the form of the Empire. ey are therefore </p>
<p>urged to strengthen what remains and is about to die.</p>
<p>At the heart of their having lost touch with reality is an apparent </p>
<p>complacency with regard to the coming of the Lord. us they are ex-</p>
<p>horted rst to remember . . . what you have received and heard. And </p>
<p>“remember” does not mean simply to recall the past, but to act on it. </p>
<p>ey are further urged to hold it fast, and repent. Here is yet another </p>
<p>of those moments in this book where the reader is slightly jarred by the </p>
<p>order of things. at is, the logical sequence here would be to “repent” </p>
<p>and thus return to “holding fast” the gospel that they had embraced a </p>
<p>generation ago; but Christ’s order here represents the basic concern, </p>
<p>which is not their repentance per se, but their returning to a steadfast-</p>
<p>ness toward the gospel in their complacent city.</p>
<p>e nal warning takes a page out of their own history. If they do </p>
<p>not wake up, then in a way similar to the city’s own well-known past, </p>
<p>they are about to be caught o guard. Christ himself will come like the </p>
<p>thief, in the sense that a thief comes when one does not expect it. In </p>
<p>their case, you will not know at what time I will come to you. With </p>
