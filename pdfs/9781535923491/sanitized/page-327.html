<p>A New Earth: Eden Restored</p>

<p>nitely better, greater, and grander than present imagination is capable of </p>
<p>grasping. Aer all, the nal goal is reached when they . . . see his face, </p>
meaning “live in his eternal presence,” with divine ownership boldly
<p>asserted: his name will be on their foreheads, precisely the place, and </p>
<p>in the same way, where earlier demonic ownership on the part of the </p>
<p>Empire was made evident (13:16–17).</p>
<p>e nal description of being eternally in the Divine Presence on </p>
<p>a renewed earth begins with the statement that there will be no more </p>
<p>night, the traditional place and source of both demonic and human </p>
<p>evil, for which the biblical imagery is “thief in the night.” Granted that </p>
<p>for most human beings this is also the time given to the gi of sleep; </p>
<p>but the present imagery is about evil, which is frequently associated </p>
<p>with deeds done in darkness. us the grand climax of John’s narrative </p>
<p>is twofold. First, God’s “servants” will not need the secondary, articial </p>
<p>light of a lamp, or even the primary source of light, the sun. And the </p>
<p>reason for that, second, is that the Lord God will give them light. us </p>
<p>the God who in John’s First Epistle is imaged as “Light,” in whom there </p>
<p>is no darkness at all (1 John 1:5), is the source of eternal light for all who </p>
<p>are his. So the grand story, told in apocalyptic form in this book, ends </p>
<p>on the highest of notes: God’s servants will reign with him for ever and </p>
<p>ever. No story could possibly get (or end) any better than that!</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: The Original Tale of Two Cities</p>
<p>As noted throughout, part of John’s heavy duty prophetical task in this book </p>
<p>is to communicate to these early (second/third generation) believers that </p>
<p>their present difﬁculties are but a harbinger of a terrible onslaught that is </p>
<p>yet to come—that matters will get worse, far worse, before they ever get bet-</p>
<p>ter. But the story would not be complete without these ﬁnal pictures of the </p>
<p>two cities, the city of “man” (Rome, eventually known as “the eternal city”!) </p>
<p>and the city of God (heavenly Jerusalem, as Eden restored). In keeping with </p>
<p>a long history of usage wherein cities are described in the feminine gender, </p>
<p>John has concluded his narrative by offering this (original) tale of two cities. </p>
<p>The one (Babylon/Rome) is pictured as an alluring, seductive courtesan </p>
<p>decked with gold and pearls (17:4), plying her trade among the wealthy and </p>
