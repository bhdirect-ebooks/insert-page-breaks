<p>Revelation 3:7–13</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>e youngest of the seven cities, Philadelphia sat a little more than thirty </p>
<p>miles east-southeast of Sardis. Although its origins are a bit obscure, it </p>
<p>was apparently founded during the early second century BCE, at the </p>
<p>height of the Attalid (Pergameme) control of Anatolia. It was named </p>
<p>aer Attalus II, h successor to the throne in Pergamum, who came </p>
<p>to that position aer the death of his brother, to whom he had shown </p>
<p>such remarkable loyalty that he had received the name Philadelphus. </p>
<p>It was most likely founded as an outpost city, thus securing Hellenistic </p>
<p>inuence over local peoples in the area.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Its location secured for it a long history aer our period. Nestled as </p>
<p>it was at the southern edge of a level river basin, it sat astraddle the main </p>
<p>routes north and south, and at the head of a large plain of lava deposit </p>
<p>soil that was perfect for vineyards. e most important feature of the </p>
<p>town, however, was its location almost atop the fault responsible for </p>
<p>the severe earthquake noted above regarding Sardis (17 CE), of which </p>
<p>Strabo writes just a few years later, “Philadelphia has not even its walls </p>
<p>secure, but they are daily shaken and split in some degree. e people </p>
<p>continually pay attention to earth-tremors and plan their buildings </p>
<p>with this factor in mind.” And later,</p>
<p>beyond the Lydians are the Mysians and the city of Philadelphia, </p>
<p>full of earthquakes, for the walls never cease being cracked, and </p>
<p>dierent parts of the city are constantly suering damage. at </p>
<p>is why the actual town has few inhabitants, but the majority live </p>
<p>as farmers in the countryside, as they have fertile land. But one </p>
<p>is surprised even at the few, that they are so fond of the place </p>
<p>when they have such insecure dwellings. And one would be </p>
<p>even more amazed at those who founded it.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>e result was that the emperor Tiberius actually let them o paying </p>
<p>taxes for one ve-year period, until they could recover adequately from </p>
<p>earthquake damage.</p>
<p>e insecurity of the people was furthered by a devastating earth-</p>
<p>quake near Laodicea in 60 CE. Added to this was the economic disaster </p>
<p>imposed on them by the emperor Domitian in 92 CE, just a couple of </p>
<p>years before our letter. In the kind of ill-advised move that the power-</p>
<p>21. is phenomenon has been seen by some as reecting the alleged missionary </p>
<p>character of the “open door” in v. 8; but whether this was actually John’s own intent </p>
<p>is moot.</p>
