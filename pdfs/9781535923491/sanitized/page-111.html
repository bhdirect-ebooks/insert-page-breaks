<p>e Lamb Takes the Scroll and Heaven Rejoices</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>angels, numbering thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times </p>
<p>ten thousand,” and to the worship of “every creature in heaven and on </p>
<p>earth and under the earth and on the sea,” comes from the four living </p>
<p>creatures and the elders. One should not miss the structural matters </p>
<p>that make this whole scene work. us those who in the rst round of </p>
<p>praise above (vv. 9–10) sing the acclamation to the Lamb are given the </p>
<p>nal exclamation point to the praise in heaven: the four living crea-</p>
<p>tures oer the nal Amen, while the twenty-four elders fell down and </p>
<p>worshiped.</p>
<p>Finally, one should note how nearly impossible it would be even </p>
<p>to imagine that all of this is not aimed especially at the readers in the </p>
<p>seven churches, who are undoubtedly expected by John, with the recep-</p>
<p>tion and reading of this letter, to join now in the worship that here is </p>
<p>seen as belonging eternally to their own future existence “in heaven.” It </p>
<p>would seem equally to miss John’s point and concern if later readers are </p>
<p>not moved to do the same. Indeed, what is le for us at the least is to </p>
<p>burst forth with our own “Amen!” to the eternal glory here described as </p>
<p>belonging especially to the Lamb, our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The Opening of the First Six Seals (6:1–17)</p>
<p>In many ways the next section of John’s vision, our chapter 6, is one of </p>
<p>the more dicult passages regarding the overall structure of the book. </p>
<p>e reason for this is simple in terms of observation, but more dicult </p>
<p>in terms of John’s use of visual images. On the one hand, the opening </p>
<p>sentence of the passage continues with John himself as an observer in </p>
<p>heaven when he sees the Lamb take the scroll (5:7) and open its rst </p>
<p>seal (6:1). On the other hand, once one of the four living creatures tells </p>
<p>John to “come!” the scenes that follow have altogether to do with what </p>
<p>is happening, or will happen, on earth. e sequence is consistent: “the </p>
<p>Lamb opened,” “I heard,” “I saw.” In each case, what John sees while </p>
<p>still “in heaven” actually happens on earth; and because of this shi of </p>
<p>venue, there is no singing here!</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>28. is shi in venue is what creates a measure of diculty for interpreters as well. </p>
Does one divide the material in keeping with the location of the activity of the vision
<p>(thus chs. 4–5, as most do), or in keeping with the vision itself with John still in heaven </p>
<p>(chs. 4–6, as I have chosen to do)? Here is a case where there is no “right” way.</p>
