<p>e Dragon Pursues God’s People on Earth</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>dragon’s failure to do harm to the woman directly has caused him to be </p>
<p>enraged at the woman</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>—and now John brings it all home—so that he </p>
<p>went o to make war against the rest of her ospring (read “the seven </p>
<p>churches,” as representing all of Asia), who are described as those who </p>
<p>keep God’s commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus. </p>
<p>With this language John oers his own understanding regarding God’s </p>
<p>new covenant people, portraying them as loyal to the “commands”—in </p>
<p>John’s terms, always referring to “love God and neighbor”—and being </p>
<p>faithful to Jesus, even though such faithfulness carries with it the pos-</p>
<p>sibility of martyrdom.</p>
<p>The Two Beasts (13:1–18)</p>
<p>Without breaking stride, John’s narrative that concluded in chapter 12 </p>
<p>with the activity of the dragon (Satan) against the newly formed people </p>
<p>of God now picks up that activity as it will be carried out by the Empire </p>
<p>through the second and third members of the “unholy trinity”: the em-</p>
<p>peror himself and the “chief priest” of the cult of the emperor. With this </p>
<p>scene one also comes to the heart of things existentially for John and </p>
<p>his original readers. Indeed, those of us who read these texts from the </p>
<p>hindsight of history have understandable diculty appreciating their </p>
<p>situation. For despite much that was wrong with the Empire, and de-</p>
<p>spite the less than exemplary character of some of its emperors, most of </p>
<p>the people in the churches to whom John was writing would have been </p>
<p>served well enough by the Empire, since by and large it functioned as a </p>
<p>kind of benevolent dictatorship.</p>
<p>For the most part, therefore, these early Christians would have </p>
<p>had few personal reasons to be uptight about the Empire on political </p>
<p>grounds, any more than would be usual in such a setting. e Empire </p>
<p>simply was; and it aected everyone’s life from a distance, since its poli-</p>
<p>cies were carried out at the local level by a variety of forms of author-</p>
<p>ity. Furthermore, the Empire was simply too big and too powerful for </p>
<p>anyone to imagine life without it. Survival depended basically on one’s </p>
<p>adjusting to the reality of its pervasive presence.</p>
<p>19. Although it is probably more coincidental than otherwise, this clause echoes </p>
<p>the sentiment of Gen 3:17, where Yahweh says to the serpent, “I will put enmity be-</p>
<p>tween you and the woman.”</p>
