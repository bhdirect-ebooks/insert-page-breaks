<p>Revelation 13:1–18</p>
<p>178</p>
<p>But John saw its corrupting inuence for what it was—in two ways. </p>
<p>First, part of the adhesiveness of the Empire had been made possible by </p>
<p>the cult of the emperor, which was the primary reason—thus political </p>
<p>rather than religious—for it to exist in the rst place. And nowhere did </p>
<p>it thrive more than in the province of Asia. But as a Christian prophet, </p>
<p>John saw this reality for the idolatrous evil that it really was. Aer all, </p>
<p>one of the realities of humans as religious beings is that they tend to </p>
<p>become like the deities they worship. us, worship the emperor as he </p>
<p>embodies the values of the Empire, and one becomes like the Empire </p>
<p>with regard to those same values. And this is where the second issue </p>
<p>lay for John, namely, the corrupting inuence of its economic policies, </p>
<p>which had the maddening eect of a courtesan (a high-priced, well-</p>
<p>placed prostitute), which is precisely the imagery John will eventually </p>
<p>pick up in chapter 17 and then will spell out in prophetic detail in chap-</p>
<p>ter 18.</p>
<p>But for now, and continuing the motif of the Holy War from the </p>
<p>preceding chapter, John reminds his readers that the dragon, who in his </p>
<p>fury has turned to wage war on the rest of the woman’s “seed” (them-</p>
<p>selves), is going to vent that fury through his own “seed,” the beast that </p>
<p>comes out of the sea (the Roman Empire). us what follows in the nar-</p>
<p>rative is to be understood as the result of the dragon’s being so enraged </p>
<p>with the woman that he went o to make war against the rest of her </p>
<p>ospring (12:13–17)—those who keep God’s commandments and hold </p>
<p>fast to their testimony about Jesus.</p>
<p>As with so much else in this book, the present narrative is mas-</p>
<p>terfully composed—a stroke of genius in every way. Having begun the </p>
book by noting the special roles of the divine Trinity—Father, Son, and
<p>Holy Spirit—John now sees the Empire as a kind of perverse “trinity”: </p>
<p>the dragon, the beast who comes out of the sea (13:1–10), and the beast </p>
<p>who comes out of the earth (13:11–18). us there is an intended clear </p>
<p>relationship between the two beasts, as well as between them and the </p>
<p>dragon. e dragon gives its power, throne, and authority to the beast </p>
<p>(v. 2b); and by following the beast, people thus worship the dragon (vv. </p>
<p>3b–4a). Likewise, the second beast speaks “as a dragon” (v. 11), but its </p>
<p>primary function is to do great wonders on behalf of the rst beast, and </p>
<p>thus to get people to worship the rst beast—by setting up an “image” </p>
<p>of the beast, and by taking the beast’s “mark” on their hand and fore-</p>
