<p>John’s Response and the Lord’s Command</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>us the NIV translators have tried to cut through the diculty by </p>
<p>putting “angels” in the text, with a footnote that oers the alternative, </p>
<p>“messengers.” None of this is problematic for this introductory passage; </p>
<p>but when John is told at the beginning of 2:1 to “write to the angelos </p>
<p>of the church in Ephesus,” then the mental pictures that are conjured </p>
<p>up by such a word do become a bit more problematic. Whether John </p>
<p>intended a heavenly messenger or not is moot, as is his language that </p>
<p>suggests that each church has its own angelos. What John seems most </p>
<p>likely to have intended is not that each church had its own angel, as it </p>
<p>were, but in keeping with the apocalyptic genre, that a dierent (per-</p>
<p>haps angelic) messenger was appointed to deliver Christ’s message to </p>
<p>each of the churches, while at the same time each church becomes privy </p>
<p>to the others’ mail!</p>
<p>us John is herewith commissioned to write . . . what you have </p>
seen, and to deliver the individual messages of chapters 2 and 3 to each
<p>of the seven churches, while he is delivering the whole to each of them </p>
<p>as well. And all of this is quite intentional on John’s part; each of the </p>
churches is to take heed to what Christ has to say to them individually,
<p>but they are also to learn from what he says to each of the others. It is </p>
<p>the apocalyptic genre that allows such things to happen, without the </p>
<p>option of any of his readers either to mourn or gloat vis-à-vis the oth-</p>
ers. ey are all in this both individually and together; and they must
<p>all pay careful attention to what Christ says to the others, even as they </p>
<p>are to pay special attention to their own letter.</p>
