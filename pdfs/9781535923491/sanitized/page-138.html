<p>Revelation 7:9–17</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>what is picked up in the concluding sentences (vv. 16–17), one is quite </p>
<p>amazed to be reminded that the KJV translators chose to render this </p>
<p>nal phrase (“will spread his tent over them”) as “shall dwell among </p>
<p>them.” ere is no question as to the biblical relevance of this rendering, </p>
<p>but it seems to have missed John’s point by several furlongs, where his </p>
<p>emphasis is on God’s own presence securing his people in the presence </p>
<p>of diculty, not on the incarnation.</p>
John follows the preceding imagery of divine protection with lan-guage of divine provision, in this case borrowing to the point of citing
<p>much of Isaiah 49:10. is passage belongs to the “Servant of Yahweh” </p>
<p>songs in Isaiah 40–53, where the prophet speaks of the Lord’s Servant </p>
<p>in language reecting the theme of the New Exodus.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>By “spreading his</p>
<p>tent over them,” God himself thus fullls the prophet’s word that (the </p>
<p>underlined phrases/clauses are those picked up by John):</p>
<p>ey will neither hunger nor thirst,</p>
<p> nor will the desert heat nor the sun beat down on them</p>
<p>He who has compassion on them will guide them</p>
<p> and lead them beside springs of water.</p>
<p>By making two lines out of Isaiah’s line one, John’s text reads:</p>
<p>Never again will they hunger;</p>
<p> never again will they thirst.</p>
<p>John’s third line, e sun will not beat down on them,</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>is the second</p>
<p>half of Isaiah’s line two, whose rst half will appear in John’s interpretive </p>
<p>sentence that follows (our v. 17). John then makes a couplet out of this </p>
<p>line by adding nor any scorching heat, which is the rst part of Isaiah’s </p>
<p>line two now put into John’s own words.</p>
<p>John’s awareness that his borrowed language belongs to the </p>
<p>Servant of Yahweh motif in Isaiah 49 is made certain by what he does </p>
<p>next, namely, interpret his second doublet in terms of the Lamb, be-</p>
<p>fore returning to Isaiah in his nal clauses. He thus begins by bring-</p>
<p>ing the reader back to the Lamb at the center before the throne; but </p>
<p>with that he also makes one of the ultimate reversal of images that only </p>
<p>5. e four passages are Isa 42:1–4; 49:1–6; 50:4–9; and 52:13—53:12. Although </p>
<p>John’s language is not from one of the songs per se, it picks up and elaborates on the </p>
<p>theme.</p>
<p>6. For this metaphor cf. also Ps 121:6: “e sun will not harm you by day.”</p>
