<p>Revelation 21:1–8</p>
<p>290</p>
<p>Introduction: A New Heaven and a New Earth (21:1–8)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>en I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the rst heaven </p>
<p>and the rst earth had passed away, and there was no longer any </p>
<p>sea. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out </p>
<p>of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for </p>
<p>her husband. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, </p>
<p>“Look! God’s dwelling place is now among his people. He will dwell </p>
<p>with them, and they will be his people; God himself will be with </p>
<p>them and be their God. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>He will wipe every tear from their eyes. </p>
<p>ere will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the </p>
<p>old order of things has passed away.”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making every-</p>
<p>thing new!” en he said, “Write this down, for these words are </p>
<p>trustworthy and true.”</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>He said to me: “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, </p>
<p>the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without </p>
<p>cost from the spring of the water of life. </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>ose who are victorious </p>
<p>will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my </p>
<p>children. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the mur-</p>
<p>derers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the </p>
<p>idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the ery lake of </p>
<p>burning sulfur. is is the second death.”</p>
<p>As noted, this opening paragraph serves the twin purposes of both in-</p>
<p>troducing the nal events (through 22:5) and bringing closure to what </p>
<p>has immediately preceded. Most of the paragraph is thus given to this </p>
<p>introduction, while it concludes with a nal word about the fate of the </p>
<p>unrighteous, thus setting o the two futures by way of stark contrasts. </p>
<p>At the same time the present vision (note the “I saw” in vv. 1 and 2) is </p>
<p>held together by a series of promises made to the righteous: God’s own </p>
<p>dwelling with his people, the elimination of sorrow, and the beginning </p>
<p>of the new order, where “everything” is now made “new.”</p>
<p>is passage is also held together by a series of voices announc-</p>
<p>ing the various features of the new order. First, there is a “loud voice </p>
<p>from heaven” (v. 3) announcing God’s eternal presence with his people; </p>
<p>second, God himself announces that everything is about to be made </p>
<p>new and that the announcement itself is utterly trustworthy (vv. 4–5); </p>
<p>nally, God concludes by announcing the end itself (vv. 6–8), which </p>
<p>means “the water of life” for the thirsty and “the second death” for the </p>
<p>wicked.</p>
