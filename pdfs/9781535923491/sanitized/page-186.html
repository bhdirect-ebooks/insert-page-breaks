<p>is opening scene is narrative art at its nest, and one com-</p>
<p>ments on it with a degree of trepidation lest the reader get involved </p>
<p>too much in the explanation and thus lose the power of the narrative </p>
<p>itself. e scene comes in three parts, based on the three main char-</p>
<p>acters in the drama: the pregnant woman (vv. 1–2), the enormous red </p>
<p>dragon (vv. 3–5), and the birth and rescue of the woman’s son (vv. 6–7). </p>
<p>It is important for the modern reader to know that the whole scene is </p>
<p>a common one in ancient mythology as well; thus the rst readers of </p>
<p>this book, mostly Gentile converts in the province of Asia, could hardly </p>
<p>have missed here an echo of the well-known myth from their own his-</p>
<p>tory. In that myth about the birth of Apollo to Leto, wife of Zeus, the </p>
<p>dragon Python hoped to slay the child (Apollo) but he was protected </p>
<p>by Poseidon. When grown Apollo then slew the dragon. But whatever </p>
<p>the coincidences that may exist between that myth and the essential </p>
<p>Christian story, John’s imagery has eected its total transformation into </p>
<p>the basic (historical) story of Christ, who through his cross and resur-</p>
<p>rection thus defeated the dragon. At the same time, the astute biblical </p>
<p>reader will see something of a replay, but in a radically new way, of the </p>
<p>scene in the garden of Eden in Genesis 3; but now the woman with-</p>
<p>stands the snake, and her child is rescued by God, who also protects the </p>
<p>woman in “the wilderness.”</p>
<p>e issue for the modern reader, of course, has to do with what John </p>
<p>is here presenting to his readers at this crucial turn in the narrative. e </p>
<p>best answer sees her as representing the faithful messianic community—</p>
<p>the faithful remnant, as it were—from whom the Messiah came. We can </p>
<p>be rather sure of this because of John’s twofold description of her. First, </p>
<p>the scene opens with a great sign appearing in heaven, whose content </p>
<p>contains echoes of Genesis 37:9, where in Joseph’s dream Abraham, </p>
<p>Sarah, and the twelve patriarchs are presented as a woman clothed with </p>
<p>the sun, who also has the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve </p>
<p>stars on her head. In the present scene the woman now represents faithful </p>
