<p>Revelation 14:1–13</p>
<p>198</p>
<p>Indeed, John himself seems to recognize the inherent diculty this </p>
<p>presents for the reader, as he returns to speak more directly to believers </p>
<p>themselves. Such a future for the followers of the beast in fact calls for </p>
<p>patient endurance on the part of the people of God. is implies both </p>
<p>that such a future is not theirs, and therefore they must be prepared to </p>
<p>endure their present diculties in light of the kind of future destined </p>
<p>for those who choose to follow the beast rather than the Lamb. It is in </p>
<p>this light that such people are expected both to keep his command-</p>
<p>ments and remain faithful to Jesus. And whatever else, one must re-</p>
<p>tain this command within the Johannine understanding that all such </p>
<p>“commandments” are encompassed within the two that Jesus himself </p>
<p>“required”: (1) love for God, as demonstrated through one’s (2) love for </p>
<p>others. John thus concludes what the third angel had said by echoing </p>
<p>an earlier conclusion in 12:17, “those who keep God’s commands and </p>
<p>hold fast their testimony about Jesus.” From the Johannine perspective, </p>
<p>in this way alone does one “remain faithful to Jesus.”</p>
<p>At the same time John is also the ultimate realist, recognizing that </p>
<p>such faithfulness will inevitably lead to further martyrdoms. Hence the </p>
<p>present passage concludes with yet another voice from heaven, which </p>
<p>John heard . . . say to him, Write this: Blessed are the dead who died </p>
<p>in the Lord from now on. What remains clear at this point is that John </p>
<p>expects present conditions to get far worse before they get better; and </p>
<p>in so doing, he has shown himself once again to be a truly Christian </p>
<p>prophet—in both senses of that word: as one who speaks for God, and </p>
<p>oen does so by announcing what the near future holds for God’s own </p>
<p>people. What is dicult for believers in modern Western cultures to </p>
<p>assimilate is that following Jesus in these early centuries was also oen a </p>
<p>prescription for martyrdom. John’s inspired word to his early Christian </p>
<p>audience is that they belong among those who are “blessed” by the eter-</p>
<p>nal God—hardly the stu that most modern North American believers </p>
<p>want to hear or believe.</p>
<p>But John is unwilling to let his readers not believe it, so he concludes </p>
the beatitude with a divine armation, spoken now by the Spirit: Yes
<p>. . . they will rest from their labors, a clause whose follow-up reason </p>
<p>has been considerably tinkered with by later scribes. John himself wrote </p>
<p>that their rest will be the direct result—for (= because)—of the reality </p>
<p>that their deeds will follow them. It is not at all surprising that such a </p>
<p>statement would call for some moderation by a few later copyists, one </p>
