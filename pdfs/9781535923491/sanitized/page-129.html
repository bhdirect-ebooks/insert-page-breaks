<p>that despite this reality, God’s own people are to be spared from expe-</p>
<p>riencing this coming judgment. us what he saw next was another, a </p>
<p>h angel, who was coming up from the east, having the seal of the </p>
<p>living God. is angel in turn called out in a loud voice to the other </p>
<p>four angels, who are now described as themselves having been given </p>
<p>power to harm the land and the sea. e sole purpose of this angel </p>
<p>in the narrative is to make sure that God’s own people are protected </p>
<p>from the coming judgments, which are not to go into eect until we </p>
<p>[apparently meaning this angel along with the other four] put a seal </p>
<p>on the foreheads of the servants of our God. At least two things seem </p>
to be going on here. First, the “seal” in this case is the stamp of divine ownership and authenticity; thus it functions as a divine commitment that God’s own people will not experience the divine wrath when it is
<p>poured out. is is made explicit in 9:4, where the scorpions are told to </p>
<p>harm only those people who do not have God’s seal on their foreheads. </p>
<p>Here such people are described as “God’s servants,” a designation that </p>
<p>appears again in 19:2 and 5, and also in 22:3–4 and 6, the latter instance </p>
<p>referring to the recipients of this book. At the same time, second, this </p>
<p>marking of the foreheads of God’s “servants” stands in deliberate con-</p>
<p>trast to the later marking on the foreheads of the followers of the “beast </p>
<p>out of the earth” in chapter 13:16–17.</p>
<p>e rst paragraph then concludes with John hearing the number </p>
<p>of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel. is </p>
<p>in turn leads to the main part of the present scene, with its actual num-</p>
<p>bering of those who are sealed. But here also is a passage that has been </p>
<p>a source of grief for later readers, especially those who, unacquainted </p>
<p>with the apocalyptic genre, try to read the text with a kind of literalism </p>
<p>never intended by John’s deliberate, symbolic use of numbers. e dif-</p>
<p>culties for later readers stem from the fact that in the next paragraph </p>
<p>the people are described in terms of the Old Testament people of God. </p>
<p>But before asking the question of meaning as such, one should observe </p>
<p>the idiosyncratic nature of the present listing.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament itself, one should note, there are no less than </p>
<p>eighteen dierent listings of the twelve tribes of Israel—and the present </p>
<p>one is not identical with any of them! is is especially remarkable in </p>
<p>light of Ezekiel 48, where one nds an eschatological listing of gathered </p>
<p>Israel. We simply note here the idiosyncrasies of the present listing, </p>
<p>without trying to give any meaning to them: rst, both Joseph and his </p>
