<p>Revelation 20:1–15</p>
<p>288</p>
<p>that John can now turn to the glory that awaits the righteous, and thus </p>
<p>move on to the “tale of the second city,” the “new Jerusalem [that comes] </p>
<p>down out of heaven.”</p>
<p>e question about this material that is oen raised by later read-</p>
<p>ers has to do with to what degree is one to take any of this literally—to </p>
<p>which question there is no easy answer. e eschatological point is both </p>
its certainty and thus the divine justice that is here in evidence; and
<p>these are the two realities that those who believe in the inspired nature </p>
and divine certainty of Scripture should be happy to cling to.
