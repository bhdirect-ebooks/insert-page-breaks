<p>The Blowing of the Seven Trumpets </p>
<p>Aer the considerable interlude of the two scenes in chapter 7, the </p>
<p>narrative that began in 4:1 is picked up again with the opening of the </p>
<p>seventh seal. As noted earlier, the sequence of visions in the rst half of </p>
<p>the book is not intended to be chronological; rather the whole is purely </p>
<p>narratival. e narrative itself thus picks up where it le o at 6:17, and </p>
<p>will now carry through to 11:19. At the same time John also presents </p>
<p>visionary moments that regularly uctuate between heaven and earth, </p>
<p>without noting any movement between the two.</p>
<p>Several phenomena in the opening paragraph (8:1–5) indicate </p>
<p>that it functions as a Janus moment in the narrative, bringing closure to </p>
<p>the seven seals while introducing the seven trumpets. In what follows </p>
<p>(8:6—9:21) John is going to repeat the structure of the seven seals (ch. </p>
<p>6) as sets of four, two, and one. As before, these are then followed by a </p>
<p>twofold interlude (10:1—11:14). But in this case the nal three trumpets </p>
<p>are introduced as a set of three woes, two of which are given in chapter </p>
<p>9. Finally, at the end of the second item in the interlude (11:14) John </p>
<p>announces that the second woe has passed, and that the third is coming </p>
<p>soon, which is then followed by the seventh trumpet. How all of these </p>
<p>work into a neat package will become more clear in chapters 12–13, but </p>
<p>for now these structural observations should serve as helpful guides for </p>
<p>interpreting the details of the next section and those that follow.</p>
<p>The Seventh Seal: Prelude to the Seven Trumpets (8:1–5)</p>

<p>When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for </p>
<p>about half an hour.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven</p>
<p>trumpets were given to them.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at </p>
<p>the altar. He was given much incense to oer, with the prayers of </p>
