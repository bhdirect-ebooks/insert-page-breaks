<p>Revelation 22:17–21</p>
<p>314</p>
<p>e invitation is then followed by the strictest of warnings regard-</p>
<p>ing the content of the book, in this case a warning that comes from </p>
<p>the author himself: I warn; and again the warning is directed toward </p>
<p>everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll. us </p>
<p>the book ends as it began, as declaration that it is to be understood as </p>
<p>a prophetic word, which at the outset is set forth as coming to John </p>
<p>from the risen Christ himself. e warning is against either adding to or </p>
<p>subtracting from the prophetic words written here. us in typical lex </p>
<p>talionis (“an eye for an eye”) fashion, If anyone adds anything to these </p>
“words of prophecy,” the divine arbiter, God, will add to that person
<p>the plagues described in this scroll. e “anyone,” of course, refers to </p>
<p>John’s own readers, those who will read these words aloud to any given </p>
<p>community of believers. Here is a much-abused passage that has been </p>
<p>made by many to refer to all of Scripture,</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>but where John is himself</p>
<p>following one of the features of the apocalyptic genre itself, where such </p>
<p>warnings are a regular feature.</p>
<p>Similarly, and typically, John adds the (much less likely) opposite </p>
<p>warning: And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of proph-</p>
<p>ecy, God will take away from that person any share in the twofold </p>
<p>eschatological glory, namely, the tree of life and the Holy City. To this </p>
twofold divine reward John also adds, which are described in this
<p>scroll. is is apocalyptic rhetoric, of course, and has less to do with </p>
individual words as such (so that later scribes who add or omit for the
<p>sake of clarity are not thereby condemned!), and everything to do with </p>
<p>content. us John concludes with a very strong sense that what he </p>
<p>has written is indeed what he had received from Christ himself by the </p>
<p>Spirit; and therefore these are words to be heard and thus heeded.</p>
<p>e nal armation regarding the content of the “scroll” comes </p>
<p>from the risen Christ himself, who as the One who testies to these </p>
things arms the ultimate divine source of the Apocalypse. In keeping
<p>with the theme of the entire book, his testimony is, Yes, I am com-</p>
<p>ing soon. As before (see on v. 7 above), the nal Greek word, rendered </p>
<p>“soon,” is much more dicult to put into English than the English ad-</p>
<p>verb indicates. Its primary sense has to do with the suddenness or swi-</p>
<p>3. Indeed, one of the ironies of my own personal context as a New Testament tex-</p>
<p>tual critic is to read the rhetoric of the “King James only” people, who are using an </p>
<p>English translation based on a very late Greek text to which hundreds of words had </p>
<p>been added over the rst ve Christian centuries.</p>
