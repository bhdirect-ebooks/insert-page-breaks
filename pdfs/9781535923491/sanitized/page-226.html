<p>Revelation 14:14–16</p>
<p>204</p>
<p>not in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>us for John, the only “temple” that now</p>
<p>exists, and ever will, is the heavenly one, which seems to be imagery </p>
<p>pure and simple. is angel then called with a loud voice to him who </p>
<p>was sitting on the cloud. is, of course, is the sentence that has caused </p>
<p>so many interpreters to avoid what seems to be the plain sense of the </p>
<p>text, that this latter gure is simply imagery that points to the risen </p>
<p>Christ himself.</p>
<p>e rest of the paragraph then oers the injunction itself, which, </p>
<p>now with language from Joel 3:13, basically repeats by way of direct </p>
<p>address what had already been said by way of narrative: Take your </p>
<p>sickle and reap,</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>the reason for which is, in typical Semitic fashion,</p>
<p>given as something of a doublet. at is, the time to reap has come, </p>
<p>for [= because] the harvest of the earth is ripe. Here in particular the </p>
<p>reader must not hear the language “the time has come” and “the earth </p>
is ripe” as suggesting that there is a divine schedule of some kind that
<p>is now set in motion. Rather this is imagery, pure and simple, point-</p>
<p>ing to the eschatological conclusion to life on the present earth, which </p>
<p>is subject to decay. e imagery, of course, is that of a grain harvest, </p>
<p>which, even though not specied as such, may be assumed because it </p>
<p>stands in parallel to the next imagery, that of harvesting grapes. And so, </p>
<p>we are told, the one who was seated on the cloud did as he was told: he </p>
<p>. . . swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested. And </p>
<p>again, because what follows in verses 17–20, with its clear expression </p>
<p>of judgment, seems to stand in considerable contrast to this one, the </p>
<p>interpretation of the present picture seems to be the normal one—the </p>
<p>grain harvest as imagery for the gathering of God’s own people.</p>
<p>The Trampling of the Grapes (14:17–20)</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too </p>
<p>had a sharp sickle. </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Still another angel, who had charge of the </p>
<p>re, came from the altar and called in a loud voice to him who </p>
<p>3. See v. 17 below; cf. 15:5, 6, 8 (2x); 16:1, 17. Cf. n. 2 above, regarding Jer 51:33, the </p>
<p>other place in the OT where the grain harvest is a negative image.</p>
<p>4. e Joel text in fact is the source of both the present imagery and the one that </p>
<p>follows. us, “Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come trample the grapes, for </p>
<p>the winepress is full.” Cf. nn. 2 and 3 regarding Jer 51:33, the other place in the OT </p>
<p>where the grain harvest is a negative image: “Daughter Babylon is like a threshing oor </p>
<p>at the time it is trampled; the time to harvest her will soon come.”</p>
