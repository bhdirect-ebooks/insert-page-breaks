<p>e Seven Bowls Are Poured Out</p>
<p>227</p>
<p>the wine of the fury of his</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> wrath. What follows then combines a pro-</p>
<p>phetic announcement of the temporal judgment of Rome with several </p>
<p>apocalyptic images. It begins with the earth itself wherein both islands </p>
<p>and mainland are aected. First, every island ed away, of which the </p>
<p>Mediterranean Sea has an abundance, including where John himself is </p>
<p>in exile; second, the mountains could not be found, thus indicating </p>
<p>that God’s judgment on Rome will include a general attening of the </p>
<p>earth itself.</p>
<p>But the judgments here pictured do not stop with their aects on </p>
<p>the land and sea; they also include those who have regularly cursed God </p>
<p>or simply acted as though God did not exist. us, from the sky huge </p>
<p>stones of about a hundred pounds each fell upon people. But such </p>
<p>judgments, as is oen the case, do not lead to repentance but to anger </p>
<p>against God, anger that has made its way into English, probably from </p>
<p>God-fearing people, so that they are called “acts of God.” In the present </p>
<p>case this anger turns to cursing God on account of the plague of hail, </p>
<p>to which John adds in his typically repetitive style, because the plague </p>
<p>was so terrible.</p>
<p>At this point the reader must be reminded that this is the content </p>
<p>of the last of the seven bowls, which do not spell out the judgments </p>
<p>themselves. Rather, these serve as preludes to the judgments that fol-</p>
<p>low. ese judgments begin with the powerful imagery that comes next, </p>
<p>where Rome is imaged as the great, wanton harlot who has seduced the </p>
<p>whole (then known) world.</p>
<p>14. It is of passing interest that several later manuscripts (apparently) try to ease </p>
<p>this moment somewhat by omitting the pronoun “his.”</p>
