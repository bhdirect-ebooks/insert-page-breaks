<p>Revelation 16:1–21</p>
<p>226</p>
<p>the Empire and its tyranny against God’s people has now come.” at </p>
<p>this is John’s own intent is made plausible by the rest of the descrip-</p>
<p>tion that follows, a description made all the more complex because it </p>
<p>seems so clearly to combine earthly and cosmic—and temporal and </p>
<p>eschatological—moments together in one dramatic scene. And what-</p>
<p>ever else, the reader must be reminded that this is intended as imagery </p>
<p>pointing to reality, and is neither a precise description nor the express </p>
<p>nature of the reality as such. What is being pictured is the overthrow of </p>
<p>the Empire as such, not the explicit way it will happen, which lies far </p>
<p>beyond the nature of the apocalyptic genre.</p>
<p>e pronouncement itself is followed immediately with the fourth, </p>
<p>and nal, occurrence of the series:</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>ashes of lightning, rumblings,</p>
<p>peals of thunder and a severe earthquake. e dierence in this case </p>
<p>is that John’s interest is altogether on the nal item in the list. What </p>
<p>John pictures, therefore, is an earthquake the likes of which has never </p>
<p>occurred since the human race has been on earth, so tremendous </p>
<p>was the quake. With these last words, John accomplishes two ends si-</p>
<p>multaneously: the certainty of God’s coming judgment on the Empire, </p>
<p>and the enormity of such a calamity when it does happen. e rest of </p>
<p>the passage goes on to spell out the enormity of it in some detail, while </p>
<p>making sure on a repeated basis that the reader recognizes the hand of </p>
<p>God in all of this.</p>
<p>e next sentence serves as a kind of thesis sentence for the rest of </p>
<p>the paragraph: e great city split into three parts, and the cities of the </p>
<p>nations collapsed. Here the reader encounters both a puzzling moment </p>
<p>(does its being “split into three parts” signify anything?) and a reminder </p>
<p>that this nal judgment is not just on Rome, but on all other “cities” </p>
<p>that have carried out her demonic policies (for example, Alexandria </p>
<p>and Carthage would certainly have been in mind). But neither will John </p>
<p>allow the reader to hear the details of the judgment without being re-</p>
minded of its divine origins. us the next sentence is the theological
<p>key to the whole: God remembered Babylon the Great, whose coming </p>
<p>judgment is then spelled out with language that had been anticipated </p>
<p>by the cry of the third angel in 14:10: and gave her the cup lled with </p>
<p>13. See on 4:5; 8:3, and 11:19 above. e order is the same in all but in 8:3, where </p>
<p>the rst three are in reverse order; and as noted on 11:19 John there adds “a great </p>
<p>hailstorm.”</p>
