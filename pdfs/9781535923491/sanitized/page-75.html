<p>To the Church in Philadelphia</p>

<p>stances, it might equally seem like only a few, given the present, less-</p>
<p>than-ordinary circumstances of these churches. Moreover, this is surely </p>
<p>to be understood as no small matter, as it seems to have been taken </p>
<p>very oen in the later church. Indeed, it is especially noteworthy that </p>
<p>the command has inherent in it an understanding of discipleship that </p>
<p>pervades the New Testament: that those who follow the Crucied One </p>
<p>should not expect lesser treatment than what their Master received. </p>
<p>us endurance as a command is simply part of the package for those </p>
<p>who would be Christ’s disciples.</p>
<p>What follows immediately in this instance is the rst of three </p>
<p>promises made to this church, where the keeper of the keys assures </p>
<p>them, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. </p>
<p>Whereas this is rich imagery that one instinctively thinks she or he un-</p>
<p>derstands, in fact its specic intent for the Philadelphian believers is </p>
<p>not immediately present for the later reader. On the one hand, given </p>
<p>the overall concern of the Revelation as a document, this could easily </p>
<p>be understood in terms of evangelism. If so, then Philadelphia is a place </p>
<p>where Christ expects still more people to become his disciples through </p>
<p>the ministry of the church. On the other hand, given the eschatological </p>
<p>nature of the book as a whole, and especially in light of the eschatologi-</p>
<p>cal imagery in verse 12, it more likely has a future referent, having to do </p>
<p>with entrance into the nal eschatological kingdom.</p>
<p>e second promise (v. 9), although future in its orientation, is </p>
<p>best understood as a temporal rather than eschatological referent. at </p>
<p>is, it most likely looks forward to an actual historical event rather than </p>
<p>to the nal event. Nonetheless, it is one of the more puzzling of the </p>
<p>non-apocalyptic moments in the book. Its essential features are under-</p>
<p>standable enough: Christ will make some of the present opponents of </p>
<p>the believing community fall down at your feet and acknowledge that </p>
<p>the believers in Philadelphia are Christ’s beloved ones. But who these </p>
<p>opponents are, and when this is expected to take place, is full of mys-</p>
<p>tery. Furthermore, were not the author himself a Jew, whose concern </p>
<p>always is for an ingathering of fellow Jews, the present description of </p>
<p>them as those who are of the synagogue of Satan could on its own be </p>
<p>understood as one of the more anti-Semitic moments in early Christian </p>
<p>literature. Even though for later ears this sounds like a rather harsh </p>
<p>thing to say about the synagogue in Philadelphia, this is most likely </p>
<p>John’s present judgment as a disciple of the Crucied but now Risen </p>
