<p>Revelation 16:1–21</p>
<p>222</p>
<p>such acts seldom lead to repentance, but to blaming God for all that </p>
<p>goes wrong in the world. us the opportunity to repent is squelched </p>
<p>by cursing.</p>
<p>Finally, John uses the action of the sixth angel to anticipate the </p>
<p>Final Battle he will describe toward the end of the book (19:11–21). </p>
<p>is angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, not as a </p>
<p>curse on the river itself, but so that its water was dried up to prepare </p>
<p>the way for the kings from the East, to give them easy access to the </p>
<p>heart of the Empire. But rather than go on to describe the Final Battle </p>
<p>itself, John returns to a new description of the demonic “trinity,” who </p>
<p>are envisioned as ultimately responsible for the battle. us what John </p>
<p>sees next are three impure spirits, which in this case also looked like </p>
<p>frogs (cf. Exod 8:3), and who now came out of the mouth(s) of the de-</p>
<p>monic trio who were presented in chapter 13: the dragon (Satan), the </p>
<p>beast (the Empire), and the false prophet (the cult of the emperor).</p>
<p>What these demonic spirits do next is no surprise; they perform </p>
<p>signs, intended both to cause wonder and (thus) to keep the various </p>
<p>peoples in check, as it were. But the nal clause in this description is </p>
<p>cause for surprise, since they next go out to the kings of the whole </p>
<p>world, and do so in order to gather them for the nal battle on the </p>
<p>great day of God Almighty. With this picture John thus continues to </p>
<p>keep the reader in a kind of suspense, as the story begins to move to its </p>
<p>conclusion.</p>
<p>But before that—and now John’s literary art surfaces yet again—he </p>
<p>maintains the structure of the previous two sets of seven by including </p>
<p>an interlude between the pouring out of the sixth bowl and the sev-</p>
<p>enth. As before, the interlude is in two (now very brief) parts. Also </p>
<p>as before, the two parts are generally unrelated, a feature that is even </p>
<p>more striking in this case, where the rst is a nal word to believers, </p>
<p>while the second prepares the way for the nal scenes of the narrative </p>
<p>itself. Hence the suspense immediately turns into surprise, since with-</p>
<p>out introduction or antecedent of any kind in the present narrative, the </p>
<p>living Christ steps on the scene to call his own to watchfulness, so that </p>
<p>they will not be swept away with those who are to be judged. And the </p>
<p>way Christ’s people are warned is also full of surprise. Christ himself </p>
<p>now speaks, using a metaphor found elsewhere in the New Testament, </p>
<p>but not in John’s Gospel: Behold, I come like a thief! is metaphor </p>
<p>was used by Jesus in the Synoptic tradition (Matt 24:43) as a way of </p>
