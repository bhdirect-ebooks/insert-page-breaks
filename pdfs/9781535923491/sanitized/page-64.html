<p>Revelation 2:18–29</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>living Christ addresses the rest of you in yatira by way of admoni-</p>
<p>tion; and quite in keeping with the concerns of the letter, “the rest” are </p>
<p>described in terms over against Jezebel herself. us you do not hold </p>
<p>to her teaching and have not learned Satan’s so-called deep secrets. </p>
<p>is latter phrase comes unexpectedly to the reader, since nothing that </p>
<p>has preceded would indicate that her teaching is either related to Satan </p>
<p>or is full of “deep secrets.” In fact, the NIV has simply tried to make </p>
<p>good sense in English of a phrase in Greek that literally says, “who </p>
<p>have not known the depths of Satan, as they call it.” A straightforward </p>
<p>reading of this clause suggests that Jezebel and her followers are them-</p>
<p>selves responsible for calling their “deep secrets” the “depths of Satan,” </p>
<p>whatever that might mean. Scholarly guesses, of course, have been long </p>
<p>forthcoming; but in fact no one from this distance can be sure of either </p>
<p>the what or the why of this teaching, or of the intent that lay behind </p>
<p>calling it by this name. Very likely she was promoting her own teaching </p>
<p>as “the deep things of God,” whereas reality is that she was teaching the </p>
<p>deep things of Satan. Another credible option is that, very much like </p>
<p>the church in Corinth, she had argued that since an idol has no reality </p>
<p>as such, one can enter the deep places of Satan himself without fearing </p>
<p>harm. In any case, what is certain is that John, through revelation from </p>
<p>Christ, recognizes her teaching as an abomination, while many of the </p>
<p>believers in yatira seem obviously not to have done so.</p>
<p>It is of interest that the preceding appellation regarding “Satan’s </p>
<p>so-called deep secrets” actually lies at the heart of Christ’s commenda-</p>
<p>tion “to the rest of you in yatira,” which basically says to them, rst, </p>
<p>that they are doing well, and second, urges them to persist in so doing </p>
<p>“until I come.” What they receive, therefore, is an admonition preceded </p>
<p>by a promise: I will not impose any other burden on you, except to </p>
<p>hold on to what you have until I come. To readers at a later time in </p>
<p>history this seems to be a most unusual way of putting it, where the </p>
<p>concern is simply that they remain faithful to Christ until the end. e </p>
<p>implication of the language on its own would seem to be that follow-</p>
<p>ing Christ already has a dimension of “burden” to it, to which nothing </p>
<p>further will be added. More likely, however, what is expressed in this </p>
<p>somewhat negative way is ultimately intended quite positively. ere is </p>
<p>no “burden” to be seen in their not being able to indulge in eating idol </p>
<p>food and engaging in sexually irresponsible behavior in the context of </p>
<p>pagan deities. Rather, even though this prohibition might be under-</p>
