<p>Interlude 2: e Temple and the Two Witnesses</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>the parts is not immediately clear, although the reader has some hope </p>
<p>by looking carefully at the Old Testament passages being echoed. In </p>
<p>any case, here is a clear instance where the reader must learn to think </p>
<p>in terms of theology, not of time. It was noted earlier that the present </p>
<p>two interludes (10:1–10 and this one) are to be understood as in direct </p>
<p>response to 9:20–21, and thus John and the church are being commis-</p>
sioned to do what divine judgment as such could not do—prophesy,
<p>and thus bear witness to the risen Jesus.</p>
<p>It was noted above (ch. 10) that in a passage unique to the </p>
<p>Revelation, John himself is depicted as a prophet. By stepping into the </p>
<p>role of Ezekiel, he is being called upon to prophesy again (in this book, </p>
<p>obviously) both to the people and to “kings,” speaking words of exhor-</p>
<p>tation and hope to the people of God, and judgment against those who </p>
<p>oppose them. is is what is played out in this second part of the present </p>
<p>interlude. In verses 1–2 John is still playing a role in the narrative, but </p>
<p>in this case it turns out to be a cameo role, although not an insignicant </p>
<p>one. us John was given a reed like a measuring rod, where in light </p>
<p>of what follows, the Greek word translated “like”</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>probably here means</p>
<p>something approximating “to serve as.”</p>
<p>With his being given the reed-like measuring rod, John is com-</p>
<p>manded</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>to go and measure at least two (probably three) things: the</p>
<p>temple of God and the altar, and (literally) “those who worship in it,” </p>
<p>where “it” most certainly refers to the temple.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>At the same time he is</p>
<p>the UBS edition, on the other hand, which has the identical Greek text, puts all of vv. </p>
<p>1–13 into a single paragraph, while making v. 14 a paragraph unto itself. is is simply </p>
<p>a reminder that paragraphing is a more modern (very helpful) invention that didn’t </p>
<p>occur at all in ancient Greek and Latin literature, which lacked spaces between words </p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>32. Greek homoios. On the use of this word in the Revelation, see p. 16 n. 14 on </p>
<p>1:13.</p>
<p>33. At this point John’s Greek breaks down a bit, reading (literally), “And there was </p>
<p>given to me a reed like a measuring rod, saying, ‘Rise and measure the temple of God </p>
<p>and the altar and those who worship in it; and the courtyard [= outer court] disregard </p>
<p>[lit. “cast on the outside”] and do not measure it.’” A large number of MSS overcame </p>
<p>the diculty by adding a subject aer “measuring rod,” thus “and the angel that stood </p>
<p>there was saying,” which is very likely the intent of John’s very clipped Greek.</p>
<p>34. It should be noted that this passage, along with the imagery in 17:9–11, has </p>
<p>served as the primary evidence for a pre-70 CE date for this book, since some argue </p>
<p>that the passage implies the temple in Jerusalem was still standing. But that is probably </p>
<p>to take too literally an apocalyptic passage that is serving a quite dierent purpose. </p>
