<p>Prelude: e Seven Angels with the Last Plagues </p>

<p>ample in the concluding line of Psalm 99 (“For the LORD our God is </p>
<p>holy”). Moreover, it is the implication of the entire Levitical code that </p>
<p>Israel in character must be like Yahweh (“therefore be holy, because I am </p>
<p>holy,” Lev 11:45). e present armation, therefore, does not exclude </p>
<p>God’s people from being holy; rather, it is the universal armation of </p>
<p>the Jewish-Christian understanding of God, that God “alone is holy” in </p>
<p>the ultimate sense. All other holiness, especially that of God’s people, is </p>
<p>derived from God, and thus should lead God’s people to holy living.</p>
<p>e song then moves from a celebration of God’s character to af-</p>
<p>rm, again in a biblical way, what should be the normal human response </p>
<p>to a God of such character. And here again John’s own concern for the </p>
<p>nations comes to the fore, thus anticipating the nal wrap-up in 21:22–</p>
<p>27, where “all the nations” will “walk” where “the glory of God gives it </p>
<p>light and the Lamb is its lamp.” e present hymn thus concludes with </p>
<p>this repeated prophetic motif, especially appropriate for John’s readers: </p>
<p>all nations will come and worship before you (cf. Isa 2:2–4; Jer 16:19). </p>
<p>Here he is picking up from the fourth line above, that Christ is “King of </p>
<p>the nations.” It also serves as another reminder to his readers that even </p>
<p>in the midst of their present diculties, they themselves, who are part </p>
<p>of “all nations,” must continue to bear witness to these nations about </p>
<p>their king, whom the nations have yet to acknowledge as Lord of all. </p>
<p>us the hymn concludes with a nal armation, oering the reason </p>
<p>for “all nations” to “come and worship”: for your righteous acts have </p>
<p>been revealed. Again, even though this is not the precise language of a </p>
<p>particular Old Testament text, it is a repeated sentiment throughout, as </p>
<p>for example in Psalm 98:2 (“e LORD has made his salvation known </p>
<p>and revealed his righteousness to the nations”). Perhaps most remark-</p>
<p>able of all is the past tense of this nal line, since the hymn is intended </p>
<p>to introduce acts that have not yet taken place.</p>
<p>e result of this extraordinary collage is a majestic Christian </p>
<p>hymn, full of both adoration and armation, which at this point in </p>
<p>John’s narrative is almost certainly intended to bolster the resolve of his </p>
<p>readers—and that in light of the litany of dreadful judgments that fol-</p>
<p>low (ch. 16) against those who are responsible for their suering. Or to </p>
<p>put John’s concerns in the language of a later hymn writer, “God is the </p>
<p>ruler yet.”</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>It is in this context of heavenly worship that John proceeds</p>
<p>with the narrative by which he introduces the nal seven plagues.</p>
