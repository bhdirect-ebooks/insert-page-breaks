<p>Revelation 7:1–8</p>

<p>The Number of Those Sealed (7:1–8)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Aer this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the </p>
<p>earth, holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any </p>
<p>wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>en </p>
<p>I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of </p>
<p>the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels </p>
<p>who had been given power to harm the land and the sea: </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>“Do </p>
<p>not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the </p>
<p>foreheads of the servants of our God.” </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>en I heard the number of </p>
<p>those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>From the tribe of Judah 12,000 were sealed,</p>
<p>from the tribe of Reuben 12,000,</p>
<p>from the tribe of Gad 12,000,</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>from the tribe of Asher 12,000,</p>
<p>from the tribe of Naphtali 12,000,</p>
<p>from the tribe of Manasseh 12,000,</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>from the tribe of Simeon 12,000,</p>
<p>from the tribe of Levi 12,000,</p>
<p>from the tribe of Issachar 12,000,</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>from the tribe of Zebulun 12,000,</p>
<p>from the tribe of Joseph 12,000,</p>
<p>from the tribe of Benjamin 12,000.</p>
<p>In keeping with the whole of the Revelation, John introduces every </p>
<p>key moment in a way that is intended to inspire awe or wonder, which </p>
<p>is how this opening material appears to function. He begins with an </p>
<p>aer this, which in many later manuscripts was altered to read “aer </p>
<p>these things.” By doing so, the latter put emphasis on events as such; </p>
<p>but John’s emphasis is on his own role in the narrative, thus he goes on </p>
<p>to describe what he saw next. And what he saw represents common </p>
<p>rst-century cosmology, with a very Christian touch. us he beholds </p>
<p>four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, whose present </p>
<p>task was to hold back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind </p>
<p>from blowing on the land or on the sea, including in this instance a </p>
<p>primary evidence of blowing wind—or on any tree. e “four winds” </p>
<p>themselves are thereby pictured as poised to harm the earth, but are </p>
<p>currently being prevented from doing so by the four angels.</p>
<p>e reader, therefore, must keep in mind the point made above, </p>
<p>that from John’s perspective the earth itself is going to feel the eects </p>
<p>of God’s judgment. Nonetheless, the concern of John’s present vision is </p>
