<p>R E V E L AT I O N 2 2 : 6 – 21</p>
<p>The Wrap-Up (or Epilogue) </p>
<p>John’s essential story has now been told, so it is time for him to sign o. </p>
<p>is he does in a variety of ways, all of which help to bring his story to </p>
<p>a conclusion both as a letter and as an Apocalypse. Nonetheless, the </p>
<p>somewhat rambling nature of this material suggests that perhaps he </p>
<p>himself was somewhat reluctant to let the story go. At any rate, this </p>
<p>epilogue comes to us in three basic parts: in verses 6–11 John oers </p>
<p>his conclusion to the “tale of the second city” (see pp. 228–29); verses </p>
<p>12–16 then oer his readers the “last words of Christ”; and verses 17–21 </p>
<p>serve as a nal invitation and warning to his readers.</p>
<p>John and the Angel (22:6–11)</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>e angel said to me, “ese words are trustworthy and true. e </p>
<p>Lord, the God who inspires the prophets, sent his angel to show his </p>
<p>servants the things that must soon take place.”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>“Look, I am coming soon! Blessed are those who keep the </p>
<p>words of the prophecy in this scroll.”</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And </p>
<p>when I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship at the </p>
<p>feet of the angel who had been showing them to me. </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>But he said </p>
<p>to me, “Don’t do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with </p>
<p>your fellow prophets and of all who keep the words of this scroll. </p>
<p>Worship God!”</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>en he told me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy </p>
<p>of this scroll, because the time is near. </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Let those who do wrong </p>
<p>continue to do wrong; let those who are vile continue to be vile; let </p>
<p>those who do right continue to do right; and let those who are holy </p>
<p>continue to be holy.”</p>
