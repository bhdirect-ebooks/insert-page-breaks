<p>Revelation 4:6b–11</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>With this scene John moves on from what was primarily a description </p>
<p>of the awesome scene around “him who sits on the throne” to a descrip-</p>
<p>tion of the worship given him. It begins with a nal description of the </p>
<p>worshipers themselves, in this case the four living creatures,</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>whose</p>
<p>presence and appearance are derived directly from Ezekiel 1:4–24 (with </p>
<p>the single exception of their wings, which are six instead of four, imag-</p>
<p>ery now taken from the description of the seraphs in Isaiah 6:2). e </p>
<p>reason for there being four of them was xed by Ezekiel’s vision, where </p>
<p>they are described as facing the four corners of the earth (Ezekiel 1:17). </p>
<p>eir most distinctive feature receives rst mention: they were covered </p>
<p>with eyes, in front and in back, which probably points to their all-</p>
seeing nature, where nothing can be hid from them as divine heralds
<p>of some sort.</p>
<p>John rst describes what all four had in common (“covered with </p>
<p>eyes in front and in back”). Next up (our v. 7) is what is unique to each </p>
<p>of them. Here all attempts to draw these images literally, rather than al-</p>
<p>lowing them to spark the imagination, come crashing down, since they </p>
<p>are thoroughly—and intentionally—an odd mixture of being. In turn </p>
<p>they are, rst and second, like a lion and like an ox, both land animals </p>
<p>that walk on all fours. e third creature, however, is said simply to have </p>
<p>a face like a human being, so that with this description one is no longer </p>
<p>sure what kind of imagery should appear on his or her visual landscape. </p>
<p>is becomes even more so with the nal one, which is not a land ani-</p>
<p>mal at all, but rather was like a ying eagle. Perhaps rather than try to </p>
<p>visualize these creatures, one should rather recognize that they cover a </p>
<p>lot of ground, as it were, in terms of created beings: a wild animal, fol-</p>
<p>lowed by a tamed animal, both of whom are four-legged, and then only </p>
<p>the face of a two-legged animal, and nally a land animal that is best </p>
<p>known for its living in the sky. What seems to be going on, therefore, </p>
<p>is that with these broad strokes the four “living creatures” cover most </p>
<p>of the more commonly known kinds of earthly creatures, who are now </p>
<p>envisioned in heaven and as having basically human features.</p>
<p>More importantly they are now seen as having six wings, and as </p>
<p>being covered with eyes all around, even under their wings. With that </p>
<p>6. e Greek word used here (zoa) has proven to be dicult to put into English; lit-</p>
<p>erally it means “a living thing/being,” but it was unfortunately (apparently on the basis </p>
<p>of the rst two) rendered “beast” in the KJV, thus leading to centuries of unfortunate </p>
<p>understanding, not to mention pictures (!).</p>
