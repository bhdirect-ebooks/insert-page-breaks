<p>Revelation 1:4–8</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>is addressed, “you are my Son”). For John, of course, Christ is not just </p>
<p>God’s “rstborn” in terms of position, but is especially “the rstborn </p>
<p>from the dead,” who thus through his own resurrection is the guarantor </p>
<p>of the nal resurrection of all who belong to him.</p>
<p>ird, and still echoing Psalm 89:27 (“the most exalted of the kings </p>
<p>of the earth”), Christ is designated the ruler of the kings of the earth. </p>
<p>Given the present diculties of the church at the hands of the Empire, </p>
<p>one can scarcely miss the essentially prophetic nature of this nal ap-</p>
<p>pellation. For John’s own readers it may look as though Rome were the </p>
<p>ultimate power on the earth, since she not only ruled the greater por-</p>
<p>tion of the so-called known world, but will be recognized later in the </p>
<p>book as having dominion over the various petty “kings.” ese latter </p>
<p>John regularly designates as “the kings of the earth”; they are the local </p>
<p>provincial rulers, similar to those mentioned by Luke at the beginning </p>
<p>of his narrative about John the Baptist and Jesus (3:1: “Pontius Pilate . . . </p>
<p>governor of Judea, Herod the tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tet-</p>
<p>rarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanius tetrarch of Abilene”). But </p>
<p>not so, says John—they are not earth’s true rulers; rather, the One who </p>
<p>was slain by the Romans had in fact been raised from the dead by God </p>
<p>the Father, and he has thus assumed the role of “ruler of the kings of the </p>
<p>earth,” whether they currently acknowledge it or not. Indeed, later on in </p>
<p>17:14 and 19:16 Christ will be called “King of kings, and Lord of lords.” </p>
<p>e present designation is therefore John’s way of reminding his readers </p>
<p>that the “king of kings” is not the Roman emperor; rather, he is the One </p>
<p>who was crucied by an earlier emperor, but, having been raised from </p>
<p>the dead, has attained his rightful place as “ruler of the kings of the </p>
<p>earth.” As such the risen Christ is in fact ruler over all those who have </p>
<p>set themselves in opposition to God’s rule.</p>
<p>e very thought of this threefold acclamation about Christ—that </p>
<p>God’s “faithful witness” is also “the rst born from the dead” and has </p>
<p>thus assumed his role as “the ruler of the kings of the earth”—causes </p>
<p>John to burst into doxology. But typical of Johannine theology, the dox-</p>
<p>ology it not oered to God the Father, but to Christ himself!—the rst </p>
<p>of many such remarkable moments in this book. is in turn sets the </p>
<p>stage for the especially “high Christology” that marks the Johannine </p>
<p>corpus as a whole. us, and now especially for the sake of his read-</p>
<p>ers, John acclaims Christ in two ways, both of which are intended to </p>
<p>turn the focus onto his readers, many of whom are already undergoing </p>
