<p>Revelation 10:1–11</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>present passage (v. 11) arms? In any case, John stands in the long line </p>
<p>of those who understood the prophets to be those to whom God has </p>
<p>spoken so that in turn they speak in God’s behalf.</p>
<p>All of this together makes it clear that this is not a signal that the </p>
<p>End is immediate. Rather, it is a signal that “the mystery of God is to </p>
<p>be accomplished” before that nal moment happens; but in the mean-</p>
<p>time there must be further prophetic activity. Although one cannot be </p>
<p>certain here, the “mystery of God” most likely points directly to the </p>
<p>climax in 11:15–18, where God’s purposes with creation in general and </p>
<p>humanity in particular are brought to completion with the sounding of </p>
<p>the seventh trumpet. So why, one might rightly ask, include here still </p>
<p>one more anticipatory moment in what itself is only an interlude vi-</p>
<p>sion? e most likely answer is precisely because it does occur in the in-</p>
<p>terlude, where John pauses to remind his readers that their own ordeal </p>
<p>is not in fact nearly over. John himself has much more prophesying to </p>
<p>do, and the church has much more witnessing to do, which is precisely </p>
<p>how this middle paragraph leads the reader into the main point of the </p>
<p>whole scene—verses 8–11.</p>
<p>John begins the main point of the vision by picking up the un-</p>
<p>identied voice that I had heard from heaven mentioned in verse 4, </p>
<p>which here spoke to me once more. is whole episode is a direct echo </p>
<p>of Ezekiel 2:8—3:3, with distinct overtones from Jeremiah 15:16–17 </p>
<p>(LXX). Ezekiel had also been commanded to eat an opened scroll, </p>
<p>which he does, and even though it was full of woe and lament, it “tasted </p>
<p>as sweet as honey in my mouth” (3:3). Furthermore, when Jeremiah ate </p>
<p>the words that came from Yahweh, they lled him with “indignation,”</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a word that is echoed here by John in verse 9 (“sour”). Most of the rest </p>
<p>of this paragraph is lled with the drama (not unlike Ezekiel) of the </p>
<p>interplay between the angel, the voice from heaven, and John. us the </p>
<p>voice told him to go, take the scroll that lies open in the hand of the </p>
<p>angel who is standing on the sea and on the land, a command that </p>
<p>serves as an inclusio with verse 2 (“a little scroll that lay open in his </p>
<p>hand”). e rest of the paragraph simply spells out John’s obedience and </p>
<p>reaction to this command.</p>
<p>First, and in keeping with John’s repetitive narrative style, John </p>
<p>went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll. e angel </p>
<p>26. Greek ὅτι πικρίας ἐνεπλήσθην; John has πικρανεῖ σου τὴν κοιλίαν.</p>
