<p>Revelation 6:1–17</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a </p>
<p>conqueror bent on conquest.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second </p>
<p>living creature say, “Come!” </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>en another horse came out, a ery </p>
<p>red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and </p>
<p>to make people kill each other. To him was given a large sword.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living </p>
<p>creature say, “Come!” I looked, and there before me was a black </p>
<p>horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>en I </p>
<p>heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures, </p>
<p>saying, “A quart</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> of wheat for a day’s wages,</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>and three quarts</p>
<p>of barley for a day’s wages,b and do not damage the oil and the </p>
<p>wine!”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of </p>
<p>the fourth living creature say, “Come!” </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>I looked, and there before </p>
<p>me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was </p>
<p>following close behind him. e four riders were given power over </p>
<p>a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by </p>
<p>the wild beasts of the earth.</p>
<p>Once more borrowing imagery from Zechariah,</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> John begins this vi-</p>
<p>sion with the appearance of his “four horsemen of the Apocalypse.” </p>
<p>ese now infamous gures present three basic problems for the reader: </p>
<p>rst, their role in the narrative itself, especially as part of the overture to </p>
<p>the whole and the prelude to seals ve and six; second, the meaning of </p>
<p>the rst one, since the nal three are quite clear; and third, how to deal </p>
theologically with the fact that they are called forth by divine activity.
<p>We begin with their role in the narrative. Notably, even though </p>
<p>this is apocalyptic-type imagery, John goes to some lengths to make </p>
<p>sure that the reader does not miss what they represent: conquest, war, </p>
<p>famine, and death. is is the obvious cycle of centuries of conquest by </p>
<p>the earthly powers, with focus on the present one, Rome, but without </p>
<p>any overt or covert indication of such. e scene is a clear continuation </p>
<p>of what has preceded; thus John watched as the Lamb opened the rst </p>
<p>of the seven seals. e drama continues in the same venue by moving </p>
<p>30. About a liter</p>
<p>31. Greek a denarius</p>
<p>32. is time from Zech 1:8, whose vision began with “a man riding a red horse,” </p>
<p>behind whom were “red, brown and white horses,” presumably with riders on them, </p>
<p>although that is now expressly said.</p>
