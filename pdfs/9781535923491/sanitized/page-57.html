<p>To the Church in Pergamum</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>of guesses). e rst of these is referred to as the teaching of Balaam, </p>
<p>a reference from Numbers 25:1–2 to the Israelite men who had sexual </p>
<p>relations with the Moabite women, who “invited them to the sacrices </p>
<p>of their gods,” where they “ate the sacricial meal and bowed down </p>
<p>before these gods.” is matter will occur again in the Lord’s strong </p>
<p>denunciations against the church in yatira, where it receives more </p>
<p>detailed condemnation. e best guess regarding the present situation </p>
<p>would seem to be that some believers in Christ were wanting to have </p>
<p>it both ways—to be followers of Christ with an occasional visit to the </p>
<p>pagan meals.</p>
<p>Christ’s second judgment against this church comes in verse 15: </p>
<p>Likewise, and now in considerable contrast to the believers in Ephesus, </p>
<p>you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans. As </p>
<p>noted above (on 2:6), what this might refer to specically is no longer </p>
<p>known to us. What is signicant for the rst readers of this document </p>
<p>is that two churches in the same general geographical area took quite </p>
<p>opposite stances with regard to this false teaching. In Ephesus the be-</p>
<p>lievers are praised for rejecting “the teaching of the Nicolaitans”; those </p>
<p>here are censured because they “also have those [among them] who </p>
<p>hold to” this false teaching. And since this appears in a sentence that </p>
<p>indicates that some of them likewise hold to this false teaching, it almost </p>
<p>certainly is not to be understood as including the two sins already cen-</p>
<p>sured, idolatry and sexual immorality.</p>
<p>In keeping with the warning in the rst letter (to Ephesus), but not </p>
<p>found in the second (to Smyrna), the risen Christ calls on the church </p>
<p>in Pergamum to repent therefore, which is the only hope for survival </p>
<p>that the church would have had. But whereas the former threat was </p>
<p>the removal of “your lampstand from its place”—severe punishment </p>
<p>indeed!—in this second instance failure to repent means that other-</p>
<p>wise, I will come to you and will ght against them. Here in particular </p>
<p>one should note the change in pronouns, from “you” to “them.” is </p>
<p>is not a battle against the whole church, although they are indeed to </p>
<p>repent for letting this false teaching exist among them, but warfare car-</p>
<p>ried on specically “against them,” the purveyors of and adherents to </p>
<p>this false teaching. e means by which the risen Christ will do battle </p>
<p>against them is with the sword of my mouth, thus indicating that the </p>
<p>sword in the original picture (1:16) is intended for battle, not simply </p>
<p>for defense. All of this is imagery, of course, but it is dicult to escape </p>
