<p>The Introduction</p>
<p>e opening chapter of John’s Revelation does what a good introduc-</p>
<p>tion to any book is expected to do: lay out the major players and the </p>
<p>plot, while giving a few hints as to what will unfold along the way. </p>
<p>John’s introduction, which includes all of chapter 1, does exactly that, </p>
<p>although at this point the plot is more dicult to discern than are the </p>
<p>players. At the same time this opening chapter introduces some of the </p>
<p>“apocalyptic furniture” that will become an essential part of the story. </p>
<p>is is especially true of the “son of man” (v. 13)—imagery taken from </p>
<p>Daniel 10—and of the churches themselves who appear as seven golden </p>
<p>lampstands. But these are mild images in comparison with many that </p>
<p>will follow, which are very oen bizarre, as for example in 13:1, where </p>
<p>we are introduced to the understandable image of “a beast,” including </p>
<p>the fact that it has heads and horns; however, a beast with “seven heads” </p>
<p>and “ten horns” we do not know, and for the most part have consider-</p>
<p>able diculty “seeing” even with the imagination.</p>
<p>What is striking about this introductory chapter, therefore, is how </p>
<p>little one here encounters the kinds of imagery that the reader will meet </p>
<p>later on with full force. Indeed, if one were to read only this chapter, </p>
<p>plus the next two sections (chs. 2–3 and 4–5), one could feel quite at </p>
<p>home, since most of its imagery falls into categories or images that are </p>
<p>either understandable or at least manageable on the basis of one’s prior </p>
<p>knowledge of the Old Testament. In which case the occasional apoca-</p>
<p>lyptic image is not especially startling. But all of that changes at chapter </p>
<p>6, and will continue so through chapter 17, with a single recurrence </p>
<p>in the great battle of 19:11–21. Otherwise, from 18:1 to the end the </p>
<p>imagery is very much like that of the Prophets, where “real” (as distinct </p>
<p>from “bizarre”) images become the general rule to the end of the book. </p>
<p>All of this to say that ordinary readers, who have had no acquaintance </p>
<p>at all with apocalyptic, should not presently sense they are stepping into </p>
