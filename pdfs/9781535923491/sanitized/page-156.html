<p>Revelation 9:13–21</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>ported so as to be “before the throne in heaven” (4:2). At the same time </p>
<p>the altar that was rst introduced into the scene in 8:3, and without </p>
<p>explanation, is now envisioned in its Old Testament expression, includ-</p>
<p>ing its being made of gold and having four “horns.”</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>In the present imagery these horns now speak with a single “voice” </p>
<p>to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, telling him to release the </p>
<p>four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>In the kind</p>
<p>of mixing of metaphors and images common to this book, four angels </p>
<p>were pictured in 7:1 as standing at the corners of the earth, holding </p>
<p>back the plagues against the earth until God’s people had been sealed. </p>
<p>Now four angels are themselves pictured as bound, and are located geo-</p>
<p>graphically at the Euphrates River. For Israel this river (and therefore </p>
<p>Babylon) was considered “north,” since most foreign invasions came </p>
<p>from that direction, coming “down” against Israel along the coastal </p>
<p>plain. In light of the following description of a vast army assembled for </p>
<p>battle, this is almost certainly a pickup from Ezekiel’s prophecy against </p>
<p>Gog and Magog (Ezekiel 38–39). And given Rome’s own fears of the </p>
<p>Parthian hordes, who had twice defeated their armies in recent history, </p>
<p>this is the logical place for such a colossal threat to originate.</p>
<p>Attention remains on the comings and goings of all the various </p>
<p>gures—and especially of the voices—who represent several dramatis </p>
<p>personae. e voice of the horns now addresses the sixth angel. Any </p>
<p>attempt to identify the voice itself is an exercise in futility, since in this </p>
<p>case it is simply a convenient, and for this work normal, way for John </p>
<p>to keep the narrative owing. What is important is what the voice says: </p>
<p>“Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.” </p>
<p>With this description yet another area of debate among interpreters </p>
<p>was let loose, since the denite article implies that the four angels are </p>
<p>those mentioned in 7:1–2, yet there is nothing in that passage that even </p>
<p>remotely implies that they were “bound.” Most likely, therefore, John </p>
<p>is once more doing what he has oen done: introducing a character </p>
<p>or a prop in one narrative and then elaborating on him/it in the next </p>
<p>occurrence, as was noted above with regard to the “altar.” e purpose </p>
<p>16. “Horns” of the altar is a dicult concept for those in whose native language </p>
<p>the word would most oen conjure up images of the horns of a bull; but these “horns” </p>
<p>are small pointed projections on each corner of a square altar, which itself stood about </p>
<p>four feet high.</p>
<p>17. is language (“great river Euphrates”) is taken directly from Gen 15:18.</p>
