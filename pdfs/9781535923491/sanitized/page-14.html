<p>e result is that John has given the church a combination of </p>
<p>apocalyptic and prophetic. e book is cast in the mold of apocalyptic: </p>
<p>it was born in (or on the brink of) persecution; he intends to speak </p>
<p>about the End; it is a carefully craed piece of literature, using cryptic </p>
<p>language and also the imagery of fantasy; and it is ultimately dealing </p>
<p>with salvation and judgment. But above all else it is prophetic in intent </p>
<p>and content. us it is a word from God to their present situation, but </p>
<p>written against the backdrop of the future, with its certain judgment </p>
<p>and salvation. At the same time this book comes as an epistle, written </p>
<p>to and for the churches in their present situations. Whatever else, it is </p>
<p>not a word sealed until the end of time; for John, with the death and </p>
<p>resurrection of Christ, the End had already begun. He writes for the </p>
<p>encouragement (and watchfulness) of churches that stand on the brink </p>
<p>of a holocaust about to be let loose on them by the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>John’s purpose thus seems eminently clear. He is told to write </p>
<p>what he has seen (in these visions), which is about “what is and what </p>
<p>is about to happen” (1:19). e beatitude (1:3) is for the one who reads </p>
<p>this aloud to each congregation and for those who listen and keep what </p>
<p>is written. Since one cannot “keep” judgments on others, this seems </p>
<p>clearly to be a call for them to “keep the faith” in light of what they are </p>
<p>about to experience at the hands of the Empire. And that leads us to the </p>
<p>questions of why, when, and who.</p>
<p>The Revelation: Why Was It Written?</p>
<p>In raising the question of purpose one comes to the crucial matter of </p>
<p>the Revelation’s being a letter as well as an apocalypse. On this point </p>
<p>two matters dominate the entire book, both of which emerge early on. </p>
<p>First, the most dominant theme throughout the book is that of the Holy </p>
<p>War. is biblical motif, which begins in Genesis 3:15 with enmity be-</p>
<p>tween Satan and the woman and her ospring, is the main theme of </p>
<p>Exodus 15, and is picked up again in Joshua 6:1–3 and 1 Samuel 8. </p>
<p>In John’s Revelation the theme takes on a thoroughly New Testament </p>
<p>twist, where it is played out at the highest theological levels. Here God </p>
<p>is called ho pantokratōr, which is used regularly in the Septuagint to </p>
<p>translate the Hebrew term “God Almighty,” mostly in contexts of God </p>
<p>as warrior (= “Yahweh of hosts [heavenly armies]”). Furthermore, in </p>
<p>his earliest appearance in heaven the risen Christ is identied as “the </p>
