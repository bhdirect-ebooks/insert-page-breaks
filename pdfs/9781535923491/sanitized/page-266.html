<p>Revelation 18:1—19:10</p>
<p>244</p>
<p>by way of a prophetic symbolic action (vv. 21–24). What follows in </p>
19:1–8 is a threefold series of Hallelujah’s as a divine response to the
<p>three woes, which in turn is concluded with a beatitude and nal word </p>
<p>to John (vv. 9–10).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Here is narrative art at its nest, and one comments</p>
<p>on it only with the hope that it will aid readers to see the splendor for </p>
<p>themselves.</p>
<p>A Lament over Fallen Babylon (18:1–3)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Aer this I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had </p>
<p>great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>With a mighty voice he shouted:</p>
<p>“‘Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great!’</p>
<p> She has become a dwelling for demons</p>
<p>and a haunt for every impure spirit,</p>
<p> a haunt for every unclean bird,</p>
<p> a haunt for every unclean and detestable animal.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>For all the nations have drunk</p>
<p> the maddening wine of her adulteries.</p>
<p>e kings of the earth committed adultery with her,</p>
<p>and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive</p>
<p> luxuries.”</p>
<p>Despite the Empire’s apparent invincibility, John nonetheless sets out to </p>
announce its doom in the form of divine judgment. Its apparent invin-
<p>cibility is also the probable reason for his beginning this new section </p>
<p>as he does, with another angel coming down from heaven. But in fact </p>
<p>this is not just “another” angel. Given the signicance and enormity </p>
<p>of this angel’s task—announcing the demise of the Empire itself—one </p>
<p>might have expected another “mighty angel” as in 10:1 (cf. v. 21 below). </p>
<p>Rather, John notes that this angel had great authority, to which he adds </p>
<p>a further item as to the angel’s magnicence: the earth was illuminated </p>
<p>8. As it turns out, this is one of the two rather unfortunate, if not disastrous, mo-</p>
<p>ments regarding the insertion of numbers in the Revelation, since by starting a new </p>
<p>chapter at 19:1, the ordinary reader is le with the impression that something new </p>
<p>begins here, rather than a very important concluding word to the woes in chapter 18. </p>
<p>e other, even more unfortunate break was at 22:1, where that paragraph (22:1–5) so </p>
<p>clearly brings conclusion to the material that began in our 20:1. See further both of </p>
<p>the standard published editions of the Greek text, the Nestle-Aland</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>and the United</p>
<p>Bible Societies</p>
