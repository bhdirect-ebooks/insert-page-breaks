<p>Revelation 6:1–17</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>At the same time, even though not immediately available to the </p>
<p>person reading the book for the rst time, here we are presented with </p>
<p>the rst of the three sets of seven. Since in many ways these sets hold </p>
<p>some of the structural keys to the rest of the book, they need to be </p>
<p>brought into the foreground in this rst occurrence.</p>
<p>e seven seals </p>
<p>(6:1—8:5)</p>
<p>e seven trumpets </p>
<p>(8:6—11:19)</p>
<p>e seven bowls </p>
<p>(15:1—16:21)</p>
<p>1. White horse 1. Earth 1/3 scorched 1. Painful sores</p>
<p>2. Red horse 2. Sea 1/3 to blood 2. Sea to blood</p>
<p>3. Black horse 3. Water 1/3 bitter 3. Rivers to blood</p>
<p>4. Pale horse 4. Sun 1/3 darkened 4. Scorching sun</p>
<p>5. e martyrs 5. e locust plague 5. Total darkness</p>
<p>6. e earthquake 6. Fiendish cavalry 6. Froglike demons</p>
<p> a. 144,000 sealed a. e eaten scroll a. e heavenly call</p>
<p> b. Great multitude b. e two witnesses b. Gathering for battle</p>
<p>7. e seven trumpets 7. e consummation 7. Earthquake levels Babylon</p>
<p>A few observations about all of this are in order before turning to </p>
<p>the seals themselves. First, the only matters in the rest of the book that are </p>
<p>not included in this scheme are chapters 12–14 and 17–22, which have </p>
<p>their own role to play in the overall narrative, and which will be noted </p>
<p>in detail at the proper time. Second, this kind of schematizing belongs </p>
<p>to the apocalyptic form of writing, and therefore is not to be considered </p>
<p>a blow-by-blow unfolding of the future. ird, both the trumpets and </p>
<p>the bowls clearly echo the plagues of Egypt—a matter the earliest read-</p>
<p>ers could scarcely have missed—while the bowls themselves also echo </p>
<p>the trumpets.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>In so doing John is inviting these early Christian readers</p>
<p>to recognize similarities between Pharaoh’s persecutions of Israel and </p>
<p>the Empire’s soon-coming persecution of the church.</p>
<p>It seems very likely that by this schematization John intended these </p>
<p>three sets to be seen together in some way. But whereas the seventh seal </p>
<p>evolves into the seven trumpets, another scheme is at work that ties the </p>
<p>trumpets and bowls together (which will be noted at the proper time; </p>
<p>see pp. 207–9). Nonetheless, despite these structural similarities, this </p>
<p>29. For further observations regarding the relationship between the trumpets and </p>
<p>the bowls, see the discussion of the bowls on pp. 207–9 below.</p>
