<p>e Holy War Is Engaged</p>
<p>163</p>
<p>Davidic Messiah, who “will rule all the nations with an iron scepter” </p>
<p>(12:5); yet in all but one of his other appearances in these chapters the </p>
<p>Messiah is again the Slain Lamb whose blood has redeemed his people </p>
<p>(12:11; 13:8; 14:1, 4). e single exception (in 14:14–16) is a return to </p>
<p>the Danielic “son of man,” who reaps the harvest of his own people </p>
<p>before the coming of God’s wrath.</p>
<p>Likewise, the church’s dual role of engaging in the Holy War </p>
<p>through suering and death while at the same time bearing witness to </p>
<p>the nations is played out in a variety of ways. It begins in the key text </p>
<p>noted above (12:11, “they triumphed over [Satan] by the blood of the </p>
<p>Lamb and by the word of their testimony”) and recurs in 12:17; 13:8–10; </p>
<p>and nally in 14:1–5, 6, and 14–16. us these three chapters serve as </p>
<p>the theological epicenter of the entire book. ey are introduced in </p>
<p>remarkable fashion through the imagery of the “woman clothed with </p>
<p>the sun,” who gives birth to the Messiah and whom the great snake, the </p>
<p>dragon, tries to destroy but fails.</p>
<p>The Sun-Clothed Woman and the Dragon (12:1–6)</p>
<p>e basic theological perspective of John’s narrative comes to us in the </p>
<p>two pictures in the present chapter (vv. 1–6 and 7–17). e two parts are </p>
<p>held together, rst, by their opening expressions, “a great sign appeared </p>
<p>in heaven” (v. 1) and “there was war in heaven” (v. 7); and secondly, by </p>
<p>the gures of the woman and the dragon, who are the major players in </p>
<p>this initial vision and are brought together at the conclusion in verse 17. </p>
<p>e second picture is itself in two parts (vv. 7–12 and 13–17), which are </p>
<p>held together by the contrasts with which both parts begin: “there was </p>
<p>war in heaven,” in which the dragon is defeated and cast down to earth; </p>
<p>and “when the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth.” e </p>
<p>story begins with the ultimate defeat of Satan.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, </p>
<p>with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her </p>
<p>head. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to </p>
<p>give birth. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>en another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous </p>
<p>red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on </p>
<p>its heads. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and </p>
<p>ung them to the earth. e dragon stood in front of the woman </p>
<p>who was about to give birth, so that it might devour her child the </p>
