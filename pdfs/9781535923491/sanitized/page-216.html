<p>Revelation 14:1–13</p>
<p>194</p>
<p>us this remarkable paragraph, occurring as it does (without </p>
<p>numbers, please!) as a follow-up to the dreadful, painful scenes of </p>
<p>chapter 13, serves to assure John’s readers yet again that even though </p>
<p>it will get worse, far worse, before it gets better, they nonetheless are </p>
<p>still “the apple of God’s eye.” In this way, and at this point in the nar-</p>
<p>rative, the churches are being assured once again that even though the </p>
<p>days ahead will be full of hardships of various kinds, including death </p>
<p>itself, theirs is the glory yet—a glory that belongs neither to Rome nor </p>
<p>its petty kings who are about to unleash a horror of persecution upon </p>
<p>them. And in this view of things the martyrs themselves have a place of </p>
<p>special honor.</p>

<p>en I saw another angel ying in midair, and he had the eternal </p>
<p>gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth—to every nation, </p>
<p>tribe, language and people. </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>He said in a loud voice, “Fear God </p>
<p>and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. </p>
<p>Worship him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea and the </p>
<p>springs of water.”</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>A second angel followed and said, “‘Fallen! Fallen is Babylon </p>
<p>the Great,</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>which made all the nations drink the maddening wine</p>
<p>of her adulteries.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: “If any-</p>
<p>one worships the beast and its image and receives its mark on the </p>
<p>forehead or on the hand, </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>they, too, will drink the wine of God’s </p>
<p>fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. </p>
<p>ey will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the </p>
<p>holy angels and of the Lamb. </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>And the smoke of their torment </p>
<p>will rise for ever and ever. ere will be no rest day or night for </p>
<p>those who worship the beast and its image, or for anyone who </p>
<p>receives the mark of its name.” </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>is calls for patient endurance </p>
<p>on the part of the people of God who keep his commandments and </p>
<p>remain faithful to Jesus.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>en I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write this: Blessed </p>
<p>are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” says the Spirit, “they will rest from their labor, for their </p>
<p>deeds will follow them.”</p>
