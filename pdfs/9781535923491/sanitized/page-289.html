<p>e Fall of Babylon the Great</p>
<p>267</p>
divine announcement of the condemnation of “the great prostitute”
<p>now concludes with a picture of the Lamb’s “bride,” where everything </p>
<p>said about her stands in stark contrast to the great harlot. us John be-</p>
<p>gins, the wedding of the Lamb has come, now made possible because </p>
<p>his bride has both been “purchased for God” through the blood of the </p>
<p>Lamb (5:9) and “washed their robes and made them white in the (same) </p>
<p>blood of the Lamb” (7:14). us she is now pictured as his bride who </p>
<p>has made herself ready.</p>
<p>Moreover, in contrast to the purple, scarlet, and jewels that adorned </p>
<p>the great harlot (17:4), the bride of the Lamb, God’s own redeemed peo-</p>
<p>ple, is robed with ne linen, bright and clean, which was given her to </p>
<p>wear. us even at the end, while still keeping his imagery intact, John </p>
<p>recognizes that for God’s redeemed people everything is gi, nothing </p>
<p>is earned. So on the one hand, the wedding garment “was given her to </p>
<p>wear”; on the other hand, such people are not merely passive recipients, </p>
<p>so John adds that the ne linen stands for the righteous acts of God’s </p>
<p>people. at is, they receive the wedding garment as gi, while at the </p>
<p>same time they are clothed so that their active righteousness is visible </p>
<p>to all.</p>
<p>Beatitude and Admonition (19:9–10)</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>en the angel said to me, “Write this: ‘Blessed are those who </p>
<p>are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!’” And he added, </p>
<p>“ese are the true words of God.”</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>At this I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, </p>
<p>“Don’t do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your </p>
<p>brothers and sisters who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship </p>
<p>God! For it is the Spirit of prophecy who bears witness to Jesus.”</p>
<p>e signicance of the preceding vision is now emphasized by a con-</p>
<p>cluding benediction,</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>which John is instructed to write. More puzzling</p>
<p>at this point is the identication of the speaker, since John has simply, </p>
<p>“and he says to me.” One can be rather sure that John intends an angel </p>
<p>here, as the NIV has it, but one cannot be sure which angel he had in </p>
<p>view. Although an angel with “great authority” announces the fall of </p>
<p>“Babylon the Great” in the lament of 18:2–3, it is unlikely that John </p>
<p>intends that angel as the present speaker. Most likely, therefore, and </p>
<p>23. e fourth in the book, following 1:3; 14:13; and 16:15.</p>
