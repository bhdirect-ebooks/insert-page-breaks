<p>To the Church in yatira</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>stood as burdensome by some in that cultural setting, the Lord’s real </p>
<p>concern lies with what they are to do rather than to irt with Jezebel </p>
<p>and her teaching. ey are simply “to hold on to what [they] have,” and </p>
<p>to do so until the coming of Christ himself. Simple obedience is not </p>
<p>burdensome, whereas trying to nesse Christian teaching so as to make </p>
<p>it t with one’s own desires can be thoroughly so.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>In the concluding paragraph, and for reasons that are not at </p>
<p>all clear, a subtle change in the order of things takes place, which is </p>
<p>also maintained in the following three letters. us the admonition, </p>
<p>Whoever has ears, let them hear, which occurs at this point in the </p>
<p>rst three letters, now appears at the end. What these believers receive, </p>
<p>rather, is a lavish promise, made to those who—in keeping with what </p>
<p>is said to the other churches—are victorious, which in this case is </p>
<p>elaborated with the addition of do my will to the end. at is, being </p>
<p>“victorious” in John’s understanding lies with doing Christ’s will on a </p>
<p>continuing basis. e promise is expressed altogether in biblical terms: </p>
<p>I will give the “victorious” authority over the nations, which is then </p>
<p>elaborated, they will rule them with an iron scepter and will dash </p>
<p>them to pieces like pottery. is language is taken directly from the </p>
<p>Septuagint of Psalm 2:8–9. e rst promise echoes 2:8, where David is </p>
<p>told by Yahweh to “ask of me” and “I will give you the nations for your </p>
<p>inheritance.” Although on its own one might question whether John </p>
<p>had this passage in mind, what is said next makes it certain, since it is a </p>
<p>nearly direct citation of verse 2:9.</p>
<p>e signicance of this citation lies with the fact that this psalm, </p>
<p>placed at the beginning of the Davidic psalter, was understood by early </p>
<p>Christians to nd its fulllment in Christ (see, e.g., Acts 13:33 and Matt </p>
<p>3:17). us the implication of the promise is that these believers would </p>
<p>be participating with Christ in the nal judgment of the nations (see </p>
<p>Luke 22:28–30 and 1 Corinthians 6:2; cf. also Rev. 12:5). It is this reality </p>
<p>that lies behind the addition, just as I have received authority from my </p>
<p>Father, which again in its own way reects a Christian understanding </p>
<p>of Psalm 2.</p>
<p>15. e urgency of this matter for John reemerges in 9:20–21, where those upon </p>
<p>whom God’s nal wrath will fall, among other things, “did not repent of the works of </p>
<p>their hands, nor stop worshiping demons and idols [in that order!] that cannot see or </p>
<p>hear or walk; nor did they repent of their sexual immorality.”</p>
