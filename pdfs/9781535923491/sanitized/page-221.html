<p>of which lay behind the King James Version, which reads, “and their </p>
<p>works do follow them.” e “problem” with John’s text for later readers </p>
<p>is twofold: rst, John appears to have it backwards, as it were, since one’s </p>
<p>works should precede one’s own “rest from their labor”; and second, </p>
<p>John’s text is wide open to an understanding that one’s blessedness -</p>
<p>nally rests on one’s works. But here is a case where John almost certainly </p>
<p>used the verb “follow” not in the sense of “come along behind,” but in </p>
<p>its equally valid sense of “accompany.” us, John’s point is that “those </p>
<p>who die in the Lord” will “rest from their labor,” because “their deeds </p>
<p>will accompany them.” at is, this is simply picture language meant to </p>
<p>assure John’s readers that both they and their deeds will be recognized </p>
<p>together in the believers’ nal “rest.”</p>
