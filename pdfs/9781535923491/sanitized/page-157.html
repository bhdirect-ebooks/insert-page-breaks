<p>e Sixth Trumpet [= the Second Woe]</p>

<p>of releasing the four angels is so that, in keeping with the partial nature </p>
<p>of everything in these preliminary visions, they might kill a third of </p>
<p>the world’s people. Again, this is simply an apocalyptic vision in which </p>
<p>John foretells some God-appointed temporal calamities against the </p>
<p>Empire.</p>
<p>e nal item in this scene, however, catches the reader totally o </p>
<p>guard. Most modern readers are simply unacquainted with the (some-</p>
<p>times rapid) uidity of apocalyptic imagery. Just as the altar was in-</p>
<p>troduced in 6:9, and later plays a considerable role in the introductory </p>
<p>vision of 8:1–5, so the angels introduced in that vision now play a larger </p>
<p>role in the present one. But for all that, the present shi is especially </p>
<p>dramatic. One is given the impression in the preceding sentence that </p>
<p>the four angels themselves would “kill a third of the world’s people.” </p>
<p>But what we are now told instead is that their release signals an army </p>
<p>of unequaled magnitude; a cavalry that is so huge it dees all human </p>
<p>attempts to visualize it. e number of mounted troops was twice ten </p>
<p>thousand times ten thousand, which calculates to, as the original NIV </p>
<p>had, “two hundred million,” a number that in antiquity simply did not </p>
<p>exist. at this is an apocalyptic number, in both senses of the term, </p>
<p>becomes evident when one tries to visualize such a cavalry, which at </p>
<p>one mile wide would be about eighty-ve miles long! us John simply </p>
<p>concludes, I heard their number.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, what follows is not an aural, but a typically visual </p>
<p>description, not of the multitude of troops as such, but of an immense </p>
<p>cavalry of horses and riders who looked like this. At the same time </p>
<p>John’s own description is such that the reader cannot be absolutely </p>
<p>certain as to how one is to visualize what has been written. e ambi-</p>
<p>guity in the Greek text begins with the rst description, which reads </p>
<p>(literally and in John’s order), “And thus I saw the horses in the vision </p>
<p>and those seated on them having breastplates of ery red and hyacinth-</p>
<p>colored and sulphurous.” At this point one can be quite sure that John </p>
<p>is thus describing the breastplates of the cavalry, which in translation </p>
<p>are correctly turned into colors (ery red, dark blue, and [sulfur] yel-</p>
<p>low). What is less certain is whether each rider had a breastplate with </p>
<p>one of these colors or (what seems more likely) each breastplate was </p>
<p>multicolored.</p>
<p>John follows this singular description of the riders with a descrip-</p>
<p>tion of the horses, which are demonic apocalyptic gures indeed. Once </p>
