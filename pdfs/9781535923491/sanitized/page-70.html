<p>Revelation 3:1–6</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>this John is using a metaphor that can be traced back to the teaching of </p>
<p>Christ himself (Matt 24:42), and which had been used earlier by Paul </p>
<p>in one of his letters (1 ess 5:2). Whereas the metaphor itself has for </p>
<p>some a troubling dimension to it—comparing the coming of Christ to a </p>
<p>thief ’s break-in—one must allow metaphors to serve their singular pur-</p>
<p>pose and not push them beyond that. In each biblical case the metaphor </p>
<p>points not just to the coming of Christ, but to his coming when people </p>
<p>are not expecting it. In the case of the believers in Sardis, they appear </p>
<p>to have lost touch with reality. No longer are they looking forward with </p>
<p>eagerness to Christ’s coming, but they are now “coasting,” feeling secure </p>
<p>and impregnable, and are no longer watchful. And as in the history of </p>
<p>their city, they are about to be caught o guard, like the thief who comes </p>
<p>at the unexpected moment.</p>
<p>What they receive, therefore, is a wake up call, which has the twin </p>
<p>imperatives, remember and repent. ey are to “remember” what they </p>
<p>have received and heard; and they are “repent” by returning to obedi-</p>
<p>ence and to holding fast to what you have received and heard. us in </p>
<p>keeping with the metaphor with which the letter begins, that they have </p>
<p>a reputation of being alive, the fact is that life is ebbing out of them—</p>
<p>they are about to die. But if they do repent, then the promise (v. 5) will </p>
<p>follow, I will never blot out their names from the book of life—a term </p>
<p>that now also serves as a wordplay on their presently being dead.</p>
<p>But not all is warning and judgment. Some (a few) are walking </p>
<p>with unsullied garments now; they have not soiled their clothes. e </p>
<p>end result, therefore, and in keeping with the metaphor, is that they will </p>
<p>walk with, me dressed in white. Given the history of this city and its </p>
<p>loyalty to Rome, this metaphor is very likely an allusion to the Roman </p>
<p>triumphal procession, where to honor their returning, conquering he-</p>
<p>roes the citizens lined the streets in white and thus joined in the parade. </p>
<p>In like manner some in Sardis will be considered worthy to join in the </p>
<p>Lord’s triumph when he returns as conqueror.</p>
<p>More importantly still, their names will not be blotted out from </p>
<p>the book of life, which in 21:17 is called “the Lamb’s book of life.” In </p>
<p>this rst occurrence, however, it would seem to have a double refer-</p>
<p>ent. First, this very well may refer in part to the citizen rosters of the </p>
<p>Greco-Roman cities, thus reecting their own pride of place in Sardis. </p>
<p>But second, its more immediate referent biblically is by way of two Old </p>
<p>Testament texts. us, in Exodus 32:32–33 Yahweh responds to Moses’ </p>
