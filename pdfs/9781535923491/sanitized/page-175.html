<p>Interlude 2: e Temple and the Two Witnesses</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>e ultimate indignity that the Empire will impose on God’s people, </p>
<p>here imaged in the gures of Moses and Elijah, besides letting “their bod-</p>
<p>ies . . . lie in the public square of the great city,” is to refuse them burial . </p>
<p>. . for three and a half days.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> is disparagement is related to the arro-</p>
<p>gance of the Empire, whose action is described in terms of many from </p>
<p>every people, tribe, language, and nation</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>. . . gazing on their bodies.</p>
<p>e (demonic) celebratory nature of their action is then further elabo-</p>
<p>rated in terms of the inhabitants of the earth . . . gloating over them and </p>
<p>. . . celebrating their demise by sending each other gis. At the end, in </p>
<p>another truly prophetic stroke, John concludes by oering the reason </p>
<p>for this outrage: because these two prophets had tormented those </p>
<p>who live on the earth. In this moment of prophetic outburst John </p>
<p>attributes the coming martyrdoms of God’s people to be the result of </p>
<p>their proclamation of Christ—crucied by the Romans themselves, but </p>
<p>now alive in his people and calling for repentance. What makes all of </p>
<p>this such a genuinely prophetic moment is that up to this point there </p>
<p>has (apparently) been only one martyrdom (Antipas of Pergamum; see </p>
<p>2:13). As noted above (p. xv–xvi), John, himself in exile on Patmos, </p>
<p>sees that martyrdom as the harbinger of the deluge of suering that is </p>
<p>about to happen to followers of the crucied but risen Messiah, Jesus of </p>
<p>Nazareth. e irony lies with the nature of their “torment”—believers </p>
<p>at their Eucharist (= “thanksgiving”) regularly celebrate the death and </p>
<p>resurrection of the One whom the Romans had tried to be done with </p>
<p>by way of crucixion.</p>
<p>What follows immediately is a scene that works perfectly well in </p>
<p>apocalyptic narrative, but would work less so as a form of direct prose. </p>
<p>It functions here as the sure clue to the truly prophetic nature of this </p>
<p>whole scene, which anticipates the concluding elaboration in chapters </p>
<p>21–22, where the assumed resurrection of believers is given its narra-</p>
<p>tival moment. us John begins by picking up the temporal referent </p>
<p>of three and a half days. Aer these days, John goes on, the breath </p>
<p>of the life of God entered them, language that is taken directly from </p>
<p>Ezekiel 37:5–6 and 14, which in turn already echoes Genesis 2:7. At </p>
<p>the same time, with this language the diculty with translation also </p>
<p>becomes pronounced. e word for “breath” in Greek is pneuma, which </p>
<p>39. is is probably to be understood as a direct, and thus intentional, parody of </p>
<p>the three and a half years (1,260 days) of their prophetic activity.</p>
<p>40. See n. 27 above.</p>
