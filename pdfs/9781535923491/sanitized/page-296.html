<p>Revelation 19:11–21</p>
<p>274</p>
<p>So John begins this narrative with there before me was a white </p>
<p>horse. At this point the modern reader, who reads silently (which an-</p>
<p>cients never did), must “hear” what the original recipients would have </p>
<p>heard as it was read aloud to them. Since the present identication can </p>
<p>refer only to Christ, this is almost certainly a deliberate, intentional </p>
<p>recall of the parody of Christ in 6:2, where the Empire/emperor was </p>
<p>pictured as riding a white horse. Now at last is the real thing,</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>made</p>
<p>clear by the further identication of the rider as the One who is called </p>
Faithful and True, language that sets o the divine warrior in com-
<p>plete contrast to the Roman emperors responsible for the martyrdoms </p>
<p>to come. What occurs next is a deliberate recall of the angel in charge </p>
<p>of the waters in 16:4–6. ere John made his point with an especially </p>
<p>unusual elaboration, by way of an angelic declaration, regarding the </p>
divine justice involved in the judgment to be meted out on the Empire.
<p>John now puts that poetry into plain prose: With justice he judges and </p>
<p>makes war. One must hold rmly to this sentence, since very little in the </p>
<p>book to this point has prepared us for what comes next. Nonetheless, </p>
<p>the careful reader will recognize that John has in fact done so in his </p>
<p>opening vision of Christ in chapter 1. Ultimately at issue is justice itself, </p>
<p>in a world where justice was dictated altogether by the Empire, and in </p>
<p>which their “benecent dictatorship” held the nal trump card. What </p>
Rome will now have to face is divine justice.
<p>In the rest of this opening paragraph, and in typical fashion with </p>
<p>regard to his telling of the story, John goes on to describe Christ once </p>
more, but now with imagery depicting him as the divine warrior. Part
<p>of the description picks up the imagery from 1:13–16, much of which </p>
<p>echoed Daniel 7:9 and 10:5–6. is time John starts with language from </p>
<p>1:14 regarding Christ’s eyes, that they are like blazing re, which pre-</p>
<p>sumably is imagery regarding his ability to see through everything and </p>
<p>everyone in a thoroughly penetrating way. Only then does John note his </p>
<p>royalty, that on his head are many crowns, imagery that works ne in </p>
<p>terms of intent (that Christ is King of kings), but less so in terms of ones </p>
<p>trying to draw a mental picture of it.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>But John’s own purpose seems</p>
<p>clear enough. Earlier in the narrative (12:3) he had pictured the dragon </p>
<p>(Satan) as having seven heads and seven crowns, which was followed in </p>
<p>5. To put John’s point in less elegant prose, but understandable imagery: if you’re </p>
<p>going to bet on the horses, bet on the second white horse!</p>
<p>6. at is, are they stacked on top of each other, or what?</p>
