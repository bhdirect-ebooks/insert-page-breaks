<p>Revelation 21:1–8</p>
<p>292</p>
<p>for one’s understanding of what John is doing here. On the one hand, </p>
<p>the city that John will go on to describe is almost certainly intended to </p>
<p>be a picture of the nal expression of a restored Jerusalem, a theme that </p>
<p>nds expression in a variety of ways throughout the Prophets. us, for </p>
<p>example, Isaiah 52:1–2:</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Awake, awake, Zion,</p>
<p> clothe yourself with strength!</p>
<p>Put on your garments of splendor,</p>
<p> Jerusalem, the holy city.</p>
<p>. . . . .</p>
<p>Shake o your dust;</p>
<p> rise up, sit enthroned, Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Free yourselves from the chain on your neck,</p>
<p> Daughter Zion, now a captive.</p>
<p>On the other hand, and now as this passage from Isaiah and several </p>
<p>others make plain, precisely because it is restored Jerusalem, it cannot </p>
<p>be anywhere else but on earth.</p>
<p>At the same time, it should be pointed out, the “new Jerusalem” </p>
<p>turns out to be the only “heaven” one gets in the Revelation; thus in </p>
<p>this vision heaven comes down to earth.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Indeed, at the end, God and</p>
<p>the Lamb, who earlier are seen in heaven (4:1), are now also pictured </p>
<p>as dwelling in the city. us, their throne is in the midst of the city </p>
<p>(22:1–2); they further serve as the only “temple” in the city (21:22); and </p>
<p>they thus serve as “light” for the city (21:23). At the conclusion of things </p>
<p>in this book, therefore, no one “goes up” to heaven (except for John, </p>
<p>so as to see it in his opening vision; 4:1); rather, heaven is now seen as </p>
<p>coming down to earth. To take any of this literally, of course, would be </p>
<p>to doom it, not to mention to do John a great disservice.</p>
<p>What happens next is of special importance, since it is one of the </p>
<p>certain evidences that for the truly righteous in Israel, the greater sig-</p>
<p>nicance of the temple had not to do with its being a place for sacrices, </p>
<p>but that it was the place of God’s own dwelling; and as texts like Psalm </p>
<p>1. With this compare, inter alia, Amos 9:11; Jeremiah 31:10–14; and Zechariah </p>
<p>8:1–5.</p>
<p>2. Here especially one must avoid the temptation of trying to make the present </p>
<p>imagery any more literal than what has preceded. A careful reading makes it plain that </p>
<p>John is still dealing with imagery—imagery pointing to a much greater reality than </p>
<p>what is presently known, or knowable.</p>
