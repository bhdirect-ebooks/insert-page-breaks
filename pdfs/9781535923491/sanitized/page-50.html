<p>Revelation 2:1–7</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. With this word our own later </p>
<p>understanding of the passage begins to grow dim, since apart from the </p>
<p>further reference to them in 2:15 (regarding Pergamum) there is no </p>
<p>other known mention of the “Nicolaitans” in ancient literature. is </p>
<p>leaves room, of course, for a large number of guesses; but the only one </p>
<p>that borders on certainty is that these people were followers of a man </p>
<p>named Nicolaus. But who he was, and what he taught, simply cannot </p>
<p>be known from our distance, and speculation here is ultimately useless. </p>
<p>What we know for sure is that Christ “hates” their “practices” (v. 6) and </p>
<p>their “teaching” (2:15), which for John are always related realities.</p>
<p>is second word of praise for the Ephesian church is then fol-</p>
<p>lowed by the admonition, which is repeated in identical form at the </p>
<p>end of each of the seven letters: Whoever has ears, let them hear what </p>
<p>the Spirit says to the churches. Two matters need to be noted. First, </p>
<p>whether intentionally so or not, John’s Trinitarian understanding of </p>
<p>God emerges here as assumption and without reection. e lead-in to </p>
<p>these letters at the end of chapter 1 makes it clear that the living Christ </p>
<p>is the one who is speaking these words to the churches, words which </p>
<p>God the Father gave him (1:1); now we learn that Christ’s way of do-</p>
<p>ing so is by means of the Spirit. Nothing profound is intended by this; </p>
<p>almost certainly it simply betrays John’s theological perspective without </p>
<p>his trying to do so. Second, and to repeat an obvious point made at </p>
<p>the outset, here is the further evidence that John intends each of the </p>
<p>churches to hear what the living Christ by his Spirit has to say to each </p>
<p>of the others.</p>
<p>John concludes each of these letters with a promise that is ad-</p>
<p>dressed to those who are victorious,</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>language that assumes that at</p>
<p>least one way of perceiving Christian life is that of continuous warfare, </p>
<p>presumably in the ultimate battle of life against Satan and his minions. </p>
<p>e promise in this rst instance takes the reader back, apparently de-</p>
<p>liberately, to the beginning point of all human life—the garden of Eden. </p>
<p>us the rst promise to the “victors” in the book serves along with the </p>
<p>imagery in 22:2</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>to bookend the entire narrative of John’s Apocalypse,</p>
<p>and in the latter occurrence to bookend the entire Christian Bible. us </p>
<p>5. is is the rst of 17 occurrences of this verb in the book, which occurs else-</p>
<p>where in the NT only 11 other times (6 in 1 John, one of the many evidences of the </p>
<p>Johannine character of the Apocalypse).</p>
<p>6. Which reads, “on each side of the river stood the tree of life.”</p>
