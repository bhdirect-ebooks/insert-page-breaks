<p>Revelation 2:1–7</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Without breaking stride, Christ continues speaking to John by com-</p>
<p>manding him to write to the angel of the church in Ephesus. But this </p>
<p>rst word appearing in the address to the churches is also the one that </p>
<p>has caused considerable diculty for later interpreters, not to mention </p>
<p>readers. As previously noted, in each case the letter is addressed to the </p>
<p>angelos of the church. Among the many interpretations of this word </p>
<p>(“pastor,” “bishop,” “angel,” or some other kind of special messenger), </p>
<p>the most likely one is that adopted by the translators of the NIV, who </p>
<p>render it literally with “to the angel,” while footnoting the option “mes-</p>
<p>senger.” e reason for going this route seems quite simple, and is re-</p>
<p>lated to the apocalyptic genre itself. Nowhere in these documents are </p>
<p>“angels” thought of as anything other than angels. What John appears </p>
<p>to do, therefore, is to keep the apocalyptic genre alive by the use of this </p>
<p>word, since what follows in each case is the least apocalyptic material in </p>
<p>the entire document. Most likely it is John’s need to address the seven </p>
<p>churches in a basically straightforward manner, accompanied by his </p>
<p>desire to keep intact the apocalyptic nature of the book as a whole, that </p>
<p>has brought about this unusual way of speaking to the seven churches. </p>
<p>Aer all, angels reappear throughout the book as presenting or carrying </p>
out the divine plan. Even so, throughout John’s entire vision angels are
<p>consistently placed in a secondary position to Christ (on which matter, </p>
<p>cf. Hebrews 1:5–14).</p>
<p>A contemporary visitor to the site of the ruins of Ephesus can only </p>
<p>be amazed to learn that in John’s day the city was located on the coast-</p>
<p>line itself, since its harbor has long been silted by years of ow from </p>
<p>the Cayster River, so that its ruins are now some miles inland. But in </p>
<p>John’s day it was the foremost city of the Roman province of Asia, the </p>
<p>ower of Asia if you will, and one of the leading cities in the entire </p>
<p>Mediterranean world. An important commercial center, it thus became </p>
<p>a haven for a large number of diaspora Jews, many of whom had also </p>
<p>secured citizenship. Moreover, it was also both a religious tourist site </p>
<p>(home of the famous temple of Artemis) and one of the well-known </p>
<p>places of asylum (like the Old Testament “cities of refuge”). It comes </p>
<p>as no surprise, therefore, that the church in Ephesus holds pride of </p>
<p>place among the seven churches. Furthermore, even though its failure </p>
<p>(traditionally, “you have forsaken your rst love”) is perhaps the best </p>
<p>known of all, it is also the church that is given some of the most lavish </p>
<p>commendation.</p>
