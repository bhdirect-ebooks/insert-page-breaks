<p>Interlude 2: e Temple and the Two Witnesses</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>nothing that follows in the present vision gives the reader any certain </p>
<p>clues, the interpretation of this part of the imagery should probably </p>
<p>remain on hold.</p>
<p>Most likely, we are to understand all of verse 1 as presenting a </p>
<p>positive image, which is then given its counterpart in verse 2, where </p>
<p>what eventually came to be known as “the court of the Gentiles” has </p>
<p>now “been given to the Gentiles” (= the Roman Empire), who in turn </p>
<p>“will trample on the holy city for 42 month s .”</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>If so, then one should</p>
<p>not think of verses 1–2 as a separate vision of some kind, but rather as </p>
<p>an introduction to the whole of the present vision. Using imagery from </p>
<p>Ezekiel’s measuring of the eschatological temple, John is now positing </p>
<p>the church as God’s temple, in this case pointing also to the church’s </p>
<p>eschatological grandeur. But then, turning to the outer court, which </p>
<p>is not a part of God’s eschatological temple, he sees it as trampled by </p>
<p>the Gentiles (= Romans) for a limited time of great woe. If so, then </p>
<p>with a rapid ow of images, where one image merges easily into the </p>
<p>next, God’s newly constituted people are now “the holy city,” which as </p>
<p>throughout the Old Testament is an interchangeable synecdoche for the </p>
<p>temple. If this is in fact what John is here picturing, then God’s newly </p>
<p>formed people are going to be trampled on by the Roman Empire for </p>
<p>“42 months,” which becomes 1,260 days in the next sentence, and turns </p>
<p>into “time, time, and half a time” in 12:14. Nonetheless, even though </p>
<p>there will be much pain and sorrow, the time of the Gentiles is to be </p>
<p>understood as limited in scope.</p>
<p>us, picking up language about the “seventieth week” in Daniel </p>
<p>9:25–27, John is asserting that the time of the Gentiles, the time of the </p>
<p>“two witnesses,” and the time of the “dragon” all coincide. In apocalyp-</p>
<p>tic literature such imagery refers to a time of national distress, which </p>
<p>pointed originally (in Daniel) to the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes. </p>
<p>John seems now to be using it to point to the limited time of suering </p>
<p>on the part of God’s people at the hands of the Roman Empire, which </p>
<p>precedes the coming of the nal glorious kingdom of God.</p>
<p>From the measuring of the temple and its being trampled by the </p>
<p>Gentiles, John moves on in verse 3 to introduce his readers/hearers to </p>
<p>the two witnesses, whom the speaker (almost certainly Christ) now </p>
<p>will appoint. us they are designated my “two witnesses,” who are </p>
<p>35. Cf. Isa 63:18: “For a little while your people possessed your holy place, but now </p>
<p>our enemies have trampled down your sanctuary.”</p>
