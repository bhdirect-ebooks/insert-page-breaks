<p>Introduction</p>
<p>xvi</p>
<p>sight to recognize that the martyrdom of Antipas of Pergamum (2:13) </p>
<p>is but the beginning of a holocaust that will soon overtake those who </p>
<p>proclaim as Lord not only someone other than Caesar himself, but One </p>
<p>whom a former Caesar had executed as a criminal of the state. At the </p>
<p>same time—and this is John’s greater urgency—chapters 2 and 3 make </p>
<p>it plain that there are some internal disorders that make him not at all </p>
<p>certain God’s people are ready for the great onslaught that is about to </p>
<p>come upon them. Indeed, at issue for him is a church that is on the </p>
<p>brink of disaster—concern over the issue of sovereignty and oppression </p>
<p>by the Empire, on the one hand, and fear lest the church not be able to </p>
<p>resist it, on the other.</p>
<p>is especially accounts for the words found in the opening and </p>
<p>closing inclusio. In 1:3 God’s blessing rests on those who “keep” (NIV </p>
<p>“take to heart”) what is said in this book; in 22:7 the closing benediction </p>
<p>rests on “those who keep the words of the prophecy in this scroll.” is </p>
<p>also accounts for the (otherwise strange) collocation of verses 11 to 15 </p>
<p>at the very end:</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Let those who do wrong continue to do wrong; let those who are </p>
<p>vile continue to be vile; let those who do right continue to do right; </p>
<p>and let those who are holy continue to be holy.”</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>“Look, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I </p>
<p>will give to everyone according to what they have done. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>I am </p>
<p>the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning </p>
<p>and the End.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>“Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may </p>
<p>have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into </p>
<p>the city. </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the </p>
<p>sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who </p>
<p>loves and practices falsehood.</p>
<p>Here is a sudden, concluding appeal for faithfulness and watchfulness, </p>
<p>with a beatitude for God’s faithful ones and an (assumed) curse on all </p>
<p>the others.</p>
<p>Such a view of things further accounts for the repeated warnings </p>
<p>throughout the book; especially those in connection with the plagues </p>
<p>and, in chapters 13–14, about going along with the beast. us when </p>
<p>John sings his funeral dirge over Rome in chapter 18—one of the truly </p>
<p>great moments in all of Scripture—it is accompanied by this nal warn-</p>
<p>ing (v. 4):</p>
