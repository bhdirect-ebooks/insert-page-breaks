<p>e Fall of Babylon the Great</p>
<p>245</p>
<p>by his splendor. is kind of introductory description is John’s way of </p>
<p>giving his readers a heads-up that what follows will be something of </p>
<p>special signicance. us the angel’s task in this introductory scene is </p>
<p>to shout with a mighty voice that Rome’s days are numbered, not with </p>
<p>some kind of timeline in view, but rather as to the absolute certainty of </p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>What follows is another signicant moment in the book, wherein </p>
<p>this angel was commissioned to sing a dirge over “invincible” Rome, </p>
<p>thus announcing prophetically her ultimate demise. In typical fashion </p>
<p>for John, the present dirge had already been anticipated by the second </p>
<p>of the three angels in chapter 14 (see 14:8), where Rome was denounced </p>
<p>for making “all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries.” </p>
<p>at denunciation is repeated here (in v. 3) aer a full description of the </p>
<p>totality of her destruction. us the mighty voice begins, in the past </p>
<p>tense, Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great! As elsewhere this doom or-</p>
<p>acle is constructed from several Old Testament passages. e language </p>
<p>“Babylon the Great” comes from Daniel 4:30, where Nebuchadnezzar </p>
<p>boasted haughtily, “Is this not the great Babylon I have built?” e dirge </p>
<p>itself comes directly from Isaiah 21:9, where a charioteer calls out these </p>
<p>very words to the lookout in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>e Isaiah passage then serves further as the source of John’s de-</p>
<p>scription of “Babylon’s” demise, although he (typically) oers his own </p>
<p>considerable elaboration. Echoing but not citing the Prophets,</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>John</p>
<p>oers a pair of doublets, in which he rst oers his theological take on </p>
<p>things, followed by the imagery itself. us the “great city,” the harlot, is </p>
<p>doomed for destruction, and will become a dwelling for demons and </p>
<p>a haunt for every impure spirit. One should not miss the theological </p>
<p>signicance of his starting here rather than with the prophetic imagery </p>
<p>itself. at is, John begins by calling the “great city” for what it is from </p>
<p>his theological perspective, “a dwelling for demons,” which is then fol-</p>
<p>lowed by the prophetic imagery itself : a haunt for every unclean bird, </p>
<p>a haunt for every unclean and detestable animal. ere is a sense, </p>
<p>of course, in which all of this was already true of Rome from John’s </p>
<p>perspective; but his ultimate interest here is with the city’s future, not </p>
<p>its present luxurious lifestyle.</p>
<p>9. See, e.g., Isa 13:19–22, where among other things the prophet declares that </p>
<p>“Babylon, the glory of kingdoms,” will become a place where “desert creatures will lie </p>
<p>. . . [and] hyenas will howl in strongholds, jackals in her luxurious palaces.”</p>
