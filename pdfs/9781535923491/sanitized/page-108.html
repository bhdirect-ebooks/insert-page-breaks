<p>Revelation 5:7–13</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>whose number was so huge that the Greek language had no congura-</p>
<p>tion for it. us their number was innumerable: thousands upon thou-</p>
<p>sands, and ten thousand times ten thousand.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>And with what follows,</p>
<p>one’s ability to visualize this dramatic scene becomes even more dif-</p>
<p>cult, for this innumerable host of heaven is seen to encircle the throne </p>
<p>and the living creatures and the elders. Such scenes as this are drama </p>
<p>in verbal form and speak to the reader’s imagination; a textual “photo-</p>
<p>graph” here would spoil everything.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>ese millions of angels, the entire host of heaven who encircled </p>
<p>the throne, were speaking in a loud voice, probably not meaning that </p>
<p>each of them was shouting, as it were, but that by all speaking at the </p>
<p>same time they were heard as one loud voice. But John’s own concern </p>
<p>is not with volume as such, but with the content of what they were say-</p>
ing; and here especially is a place where our chapter and verse divisions
<p>can easily get in the way of our “hearing” the text well. To get at what </p>
<p>John himself is seeing/hearing, the reader may be helped by having the </p>
<p>two adorations of our chapters 4 and 5 set side by side. One should </p>
<p>especially note the similarities and the dierences, which are extremely </p>
<p>important theologically, both for John himself and for those who read </p>
<p>what he has written.</p>
<p>You are worthy, our Lord and God, Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain,</p>
<p>to receive glory and honor and power, to receive power and wea<span class="_ _1" />lth a<span class="_ _1" />nd wisdom</p>
<p>for you created all things, and strength and honor and glory and praise</p>
<p>and by your will they were created</p>
<p>and have their being</p>
One can scarcely miss the individual emphases. Even though in
<p>John’s Gospel, God created all things through the Word (the Son), here </p>
<p>that emphasis rests with the Father alone; and in giving praise to the </p>
<p>Lamb (the Son), the focus is not on creation, but altogether on redemp-</p>
<p>tion (“because you were slain”). And with this the heavenly picture is </p>
<p>complete. e eternal God—Father, Son, and Spirit—is both Creator </p>
<p>25. e Greek is as ambiguous as the English translations: myriades myriadōn kai </p>
<p>chilades chiliadōn. e language itself is borrowed from Dan 7:10, where in Daniel’s </p>
<p>vision “thousands of thousands attended him [the Ancient of Days]; ten thousand </p>
<p>times ten thousand stood before him.”</p>
<p>26. In the same way as is anyone’s attempt to paint such a scene for the sake of oth-</p>
<p>ers, since people’s visual imaginations dier from one another. us everyone’s own </p>
<p>visual image is “right” in such an instance.</p>
