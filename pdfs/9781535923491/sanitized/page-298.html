<p>Revelation 19:11–21</p>
<p>276</p>
<p>to identify Christ with language familiar to later readers from John’s </p>
<p>Gospel: and his name—besides “Faithful and True”—is the Word of </p>
<p>God. is last descriptor is the clear evidence of the close relationship </p>
<p>between the present Revelation and the Fourth Gospel, which also his-</p>
<p>torically (and almost certainly correctly so) bears the name of John. </p>
<p>Understandably, given the emphases in the present description, the </p>
<p>heavenly cavalry that Christ is leading were also riding on white horses </p>
<p>and dressed in ne linen, white and clean. Here is the certain evidence </p>
<p>that John’s present interest is not on the coming battle as such, but on </p>
the character of the divine combatants, since warriors go into battle ar-
<p>rayed in heavy armor, not “ne linen.” And since the description of the </p>
<p>combatants here so clearly echoes verse 8 above (“ne linen, bright and </p>
<p>clean”), one would be hard pressed indeed to see the present cavalry </p>
<p>as anything other than the redeemed—the bride of the Lamb—as now </p>
<p>joining the Warrior Christ in the Final Battle.</p>
<p>What follows this identication is a set of two sentences that de-</p>
scribe Christ as the divine warrior, the “Lion of the tribe of Judah” who
<p>has triumphed (5:5), and who now leads the heavenly host in the Last </p>
<p>Battle against Satan and his earthly minions, the Empire and its allies. </p>
<p>First, and picking up imagery from his opening presentation of Christ </p>
<p>in 1:15, the reader is told that coming out of his mouth is a sharp </p>
<p>sword, whose purpose is to strike down the nations. is plural, “na-</p>
<p>tions,” is a reminder that Rome was not alone in this enmity against </p>
<p>God and God’s people. us one is taken back to chapter 13, where the </p>
<p>beast that came out of the sea (Rome and its Empire) had seven heads </p>
<p>and ten diadems, images picked up again in chapter 17, and referring to </p>
<p>the various kingdoms (Egypt, Babylon, etc.) under Roman dominion. </p>
<p>Now in the Last Battle Christ leads the heavenly forces that will “strike </p>
<p>them down.” To emphasize this point John cites from Psalm 2, which </p>
<p>had long held special meaning for the beleaguered Jewish communities </p>
<p>worldwide as they looked for a Messiah who would come and deliver </p>
<p>them from their former (Babylonian) and current (Roman) enslave-</p>
<p>ment. is is followed in turn by one of the rare moments in the book, </p>
<p>where John actually cites an Old Testament text so that his readers will </p>
<p>recognize Christ’s coming defeat of the Empire as fulllment of Psalm </p>
<p>2:7. us John prophesies that as a result of the Last Battle, Christ will </p>
<p>rule them [the nations] with an iron scepter.</p>
