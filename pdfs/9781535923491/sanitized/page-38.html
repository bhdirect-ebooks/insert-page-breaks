<p>Revelation 1:12–16</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>lampstands was someone like a son of man, </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>dressed in a robe</p>
<p>reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>e hair on his head was white like wool, as white as snow, and </p>
<p>his eyes were like blazing re. </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>His feet were like bronze glowing </p>
<p>in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters. </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>In his right hand he held seven stars, and coming out of his </p>
<p>mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword. His face was like the sun </p>
<p>shining in all its brilliance.</p>
<p>Aer describing his response to the booming voice he had heard, John </p>
<p>then turned around to look at the gure himself, expressed in abbre-</p>
<p>viated form: I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to </p>
<p>me. What John oers rst, however, is the setting: I saw seven golden </p>
<p>lampstands,</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> which are almost certainly to be understood as the meno-</p>
<p>rah, a lampstand with seven candles burning brightly. e “lampstands” </p>
<p>themselves will be identied at the end (v. 20) as the seven churches to </p>
<p>be addressed by letter in chapters 2 and 3. But John’s immediate interest </p>
<p>is not in the lampstands as such, but in the gure who is standing in the </p>
<p>midst of them, whom John will go on to describe by way of elements </p>
<p>from Daniel 7 and 10 (plus Ezekiel 1).</p>
<p>e description includes seven particulars (hair, eyes, feet, voice, </p>
<p>right hand, mouth, and face), ve of which have to do with the head; </p>
<p>only the feet and right hand are from elsewhere on the body. e gure, </p>
<p>John says, was like</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>a son of man, which all of his readers will know</p>
<p>from the Gospel narratives is the title Jesus used of himself. But it does </p>
<p>not appear here in titular form; rather it is expressed in the precise lan-</p>
<p>guage of Daniel 7:13, where the mysterious gure (from the perspective </p>
<p>of the readers of the OT) who stood before Daniel was described as </p>
<p>“one like a son of man.” For Daniel this would have meant simply “a </p>
<p>human gure,” almost certainly intended to describe Israel’s hoped-for </p>
<p>Messiah. But at the same time, and thus creating a unique collage of </p>
<p>12. See Daniel 7:13</p>
<p>13. Although the number of lampstands is Johannine, the description of them as </p>
<p>“golden” reects both Israel’s original lampstands in Exod 25:31–40 and that appear-</p>
<p>ing in Zechariah’s vision in 4:2.</p>
<p>14. Greek ὅμοιον. is is the rst of 21 occurrences of this word in the </p>
<p>Revelation—47 percent of the total in the NT. But since 14 of the others occur in </p>
<p>Matthew and Luke, all in parables and three of which they have in common (in the </p>
<p>so-called Q source), John in reality has over 50 percent of its NT uses (understandably </p>
<p>so, given the parabolic nature of this text).</p>
