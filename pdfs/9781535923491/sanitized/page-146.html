<p>Revelation 8:6–13</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>source is made certain. Yet it is not attributed directly to God—as in </p>
<p>modern parlance where such phenomena are oen described as “acts of </p>
<p>God”—even though no such hesitation existed in the Exodus account </p>
<p>itself.</p>
<p>e destruction in this case is then expressed in a way that is </p>
<p>a bit more dicult for one to grasp visually. It begins with the more </p>
<p>generalized reality that a third of the earth was burned up. e ul-</p>
<p>timate intent of such destruction is then specied in two ways. First, </p>
<p>a third of the trees were burned up. at this pictures the nature of </p>
<p>the destruction as over against its reality as such is made certain by the </p>
<p>concluding description, and all the green grass was burned up. us </p>
<p>what the preceding “winds” could not do (see 7:3) the present “hail </p>
<p>and re” achieve—a complete destruction of the land’s primary growth, </p>
<p>“green grass.”</p>
<p>No one living in Rome at the time of this writing could have missed </p>
<p>the implications of what happened when the second angel sounded </p>
<p>his trumpet, since it is a rather precise description of the eruption of </p>
<p>Mount Vesuvius on the coast of the Bay of Naples, which a few years </p>
<p>earlier (79 CE) had destroyed the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum. </p>
<p>As it turns out, this is also the only one of these plagues that has its ori-</p>
<p>gins on the earth itself. us what is pictured is something like a huge </p>
<p>mountain, all ablaze, which is seen to have been thrown into the sea.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e eects of this eruption continue the partial nature of the judgment </p>
<p>from the rst plague, so that what happened above to “a third of the </p>
<p>earth” happens now to a third of the sea, in this case being turned to </p>
<p>blood, as did the Nile in the rst plague in Exodus 7:17–20. “e sea,” </p>
<p>of course, is the Mediterranean; but this rather impossible event indi-</p>
<p>cates how much these pictures are intended to address the imagination </p>
<p>and are not to be pictured literally; aer all, it is exceedingly dicult </p>
<p>even to imagine visually a third of the sea turning to blood. At any rate, </p>
<p>John is well aware of the disastrous eects of such marine contamina-</p>
<p>tion, since he follows by noting that a third of all the living creatures </p>
<p>in the sea died. Here again his interest is in the partial destruction of </p>
<p>the sea; only one third of its marine population died. e third result </p>
<p>of this second plague is aimed directly at Rome itself, since at the time </p>
<p>4. is latter feature (“thrown into the sea”) is also a reection of what happened to </p>
<p>Vesuvius, since its lava ow went a considerable distance into the sea—even though the </p>
<p>whole mountain was not destroyed, which apocalyptic license allows John to picture.</p>
