<p>e Grain Harvest</p>
<p>203</p>
<p>like a son of man” takes instruction from another angel (meaning not </p>
<p>another one with regard to this one, but yet another angel from heaven) </p>
<p>who in this case came out of the temple and called in a loud voice </p>
<p>to him who was sitting on the cloud. At issue nally is whether John </p>
<p>intended his “one like a son of man” here to be titular at all, as over </p>
<p>against putting emphasis altogether on the human likeness of the one </p>
<p>sitting on the cloud.</p>
<p>To resolve this issue it must be noted rst of all that this is apoca-</p>
<p>lyptic imagery, not narrative history, and that for John especially, angels </p>
either “do” almost everything divine or set in motion such matters.
<p>e real diculty for most Christian readers, therefore, is a preformed </p>
<p>theological conclusion as to whether or not an angel can rightly signal </p>
<p>the Risen Lord regarding the “harvest of the earth”; but in an apoca-</p>
<p>lyptic book that seems like a small matter when set in the context of </p>
<p>the overall imagery on its own. at John intends this as a reference </p>
<p>to Christ seems to be made certain by the rest of what is said: rst, the </p>
<p>“one like a son of man” is seated “on the [white] cloud,” thus indicat-</p>
<p>ing his present heavenly existence; second, and far more importantly, </p>
<p>this “one like a son of man” has “a gold crown on his head.” It is hard </p>
<p>to imagine that with this imagery John intended anything other than </p>
<p>royalty. Why, if this is not so, such imagery at all, one wonders? And </p>
<p>one also wonders, what other royalty exists in heaven apart from the </p>
<p>Risen Lord himself? And nally, one wonders still further, who else </p>
<p>could possibly be intended by such imagery if not Christ—an angel, for </p>
<p>example, who elsewhere in this book are never confused with human </p>
<p>beings? To the contrary, everything else about the imagery except one’s </p>
<p>theological predilections suggests that this is simply an apocalyptic way </p>
<p>of describing Christ. e crucial point to all of this in the narrative, of </p>
<p>course, is the nal one: “the one like a son of man . . . had a sharp sickle </p>
<p>in his hand,” which is the immediate point of everything.</p>
<p>e fact that John starts the next sentence (v. 15) with then an-</p>
<p>other angel likewise points away from Christ to simply “another angel” </p>
<p>among the many in this book. ey are, aer all, the heavenly beings </p>
<p>whose activity keeps the narrative moving along—not to mention that </p>
<p>the preceding description is precisely not that of any angel known in the </p>
<p>biblical text. is angel is seen as having come out of the temple, prob-</p>
<p>ably intending the heavenly temple rst noted in 11:19, which will now </p>
<p>appear with some regularity in the rest of the narrative, but explicitly </p>
