<p>Revelation 12:13–17</p>
<p>176</p>
<p>the wilderness, where she would be taken care of for a time, times </p>
<p>and half a time, out of the serpent’s reach. Although there is some </p>
<p>debate as to what John intended by this imagery, it seems very likely </p>
<p>that he is indirectly referring to the early Jewish Christian community </p>
<p>that had ed to Pella, but whose further existence is shrouded in mys-</p>
<p>tery.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Even so, John’s interest has not to do with that bit of history as</p>
<p>such, but with what this imagery now means for the “new diaspora” </p>
<p>of followers of the Lamb, whose present story is being told by this re-</p>
<p>telling of the Israel’s exodus from Egypt with apocalyptic imagery. e </p>
<p>temporal signal “time, times, and half a time” probably points to its </p>
<p>limited duration. One should especially note, rst, that the location </p>
<p>is “the wilderness,” which was the location of the rst exodus and is </p>
<p>regularly repeated in Isaiah in anticipation of the second exodus; and </p>
<p>second, that they are miraculously delivered from the river, in this case </p>
<p>by the earth . . . opening its mouth and swallowing the river.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>us,</p>
<p>whatever John ultimately intended by this imagery, it is now expressed </p>
<p>with clear echoes from the Exodus narrative.</p>
<p>Of present interest, then, is John’s use of the imagery of Israel’s ight </p>
<p>from Egypt in the rst part of the paragraph (vv. 14–16), where Satan </p>
<p>now pursues God’s people by means of water like a river . . . spewed . . . </p>
<p>from the serpent’s mouth. ese echoes from the rst exodus of God’s </p>
<p>people are now being replayed as Rome’s attempt to destroy God’s new </p>
<p>covenant people, despite the fact that many of the details lie in the area </p>
<p>of mystery. at is, even though John’s overall point seems easy enough </p>
<p>to handle, one is less certain as to whether many—if any—of the details </p>
<p>have specic referents, or whether they are simply part of a picture that </p>
<p>is now being reframed so as to show the similarities between Rome’s </p>
<p>present pursuit of the church in Asia Minor and Pharaoh’s earlier pur-</p>
<p>suit of Israel aer they had le Egypt.</p>
<p>In any case, all of this reminiscing about Pharaoh’s pursuit of Israel </p>
<p>in the past is intended to serve as a biblical analogy for what Rome </p>
<p>is about to do to the churches of western Asia Minor, the point John </p>
<p>makes at the end of the paragraph. is sentence (v. 17) clearly signals </p>
<p>to John’s readers that the time of toleration is coming to an end. e </p>
<p>17. On this bit of history see, e.g., Robert Houston Smith’s entry on Pella in the </p>
<p>Anchor Bible Dictionary (New York: Doubleday, 1992) 5:220–21.</p>
<p>18. See, inter alia, Isa 40:3 (the best known of these); cf. 41:18; 43:19–20; </p>
<p>48:20–21.</p>
