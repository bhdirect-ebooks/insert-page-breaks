<p>Revelation 12:7–12</p>
<p>168</p>
<p>But woe to the earth and the sea,</p>
<p> because the devil has gone down to you!</p>
<p>He is full of fury,</p>
<p> because he knows his time is short.”</p>
<p>On the basis of how this part of the narrative begins, one might be </p>
<p>tempted to refer to this section under the heading “War in Heaven.” But </p>
<p>that would be to mislead the reader by a large margin, since John’s inter-</p>
<p>est lies not with the war as such, but with the defeat of the dragon and </p>
<p>his eventually being “hurled to the earth.” e narrative thus comes in </p>
<p>two clear parts: verses 7–9, which concentrate altogether on the defeat </p>
<p>of the dragon; and verses 10–12, which by way of poetry announce the </p>
<p>twofold eect of his defeat for the people of God on earth. In so doing </p>
<p>it tells the essential Christian story in four parts, beginning with an </p>
<p>announcement of the outcome (v. 10a) and its cause (v. 10b), followed </p>
<p>by the believers’ own involvement (v. 11), with a concluding note of </p>
<p>rejoicing in heaven and woe on earth (v. 12).</p>
<p>e narrative begins with the simple announcement, War broke </p>
<p>out in heaven. In John’s narrative this responds directly to verse 5, </p>
<p>where the Messiah has been exalted to heaven. us “her child was </p>
<p>snatched up to God and to his throne . . . and war broke out in heaven.” </p>
<p>Nonetheless, even though the narrative that follows in this case neces-</p>
<p>sarily succeeds the imagery of Christ’s ascension, it is ultimately more </p>
<p>cosmic in its overall scope. So John begins by using imagery that as-</p>
<p>sumes time past (aer all, the snake was present in the garden of Eden); </p>
<p>but in the present narrative everything hinges on Christ’s death, resur-</p>
<p>rection, and ascension. e awkwardness is simply a natural result of </p>
<p>our being time-bound, and necessarily seeing everything in temporal </p>
terms with one moment succeeding another. But from the divine per-
<p>spective in which John is here seeing things, the ultimate defeat of Satan </p>
<p>took place through the death and resurrection of the Slain Lamb—and </p>
<p>that is the perspective from which the reader is expected to understand </p>
<p>the present imagery.</p>
<p>us the “war in heaven” is here pictured in cosmic terms, as be-</p>
<p>tween Michael and his angels and the dragon . . . and his angels. is </p>
<p>unusual moment wherein John actually names the archangel Michael </p>
<p>belongs to a somewhat foggy history that developed in the intertesta-</p>
<p>mental period, where the various angels were ranked and given names. </p>
<p>In most of these cases Michael is understood to be the leading angel </p>
