<p>To the Church in yatira</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>and his people. Aer all, how could the next sentence have meaning for </p>
<p>the rest, if this were not so?</p>
<p>In any case, the goal of this judgment on Jezebel and her children </p>
<p>is that all the churches will know (clear evidence that the letters are </p>
<p>intended for all to read) two realities about the risen Christ. First, he </p>
<p>is the one who searches hearts and minds. One can scarcely miss the </p>
<p>very high Christology that is assumed by this declaration on the part of </p>
<p>our Lord. Whatever else Israel understood about their God, they knew </p>
<p>that ultimately it was not just the creation of the physical world, nor </p>
<p>the fact that he could see what people did, that made Yahweh unlike </p>
<p>the gods of the surrounding peoples. Rather, one of the major things </p>
<p>that set Yahweh apart from others was the fact that Israel’s God saw into </p>
<p>people’s hearts, and thus understood their thinking and deepest mo-</p>
<p>tives. us the psalmist cried out, “search me . . . and know my heart” </p>
<p>(Psalm 139:23), and through Jeremiah Yahweh himself spoke to his </p>
<p>people, “I the LORD search the heart and examine the mind” (Jeremiah </p>
<p>17:10). us in the present context, the judgments to be meted out on </p>
<p>“Jezebel” and her “children” will mean that “all the churches” will know </p>
that Christ himself assumes this highest of divine characteristics.
<p>Moreover, and precisely because Christ can “search the hearts and </p>
<p>minds,” he will repay each of you according to your deeds. One should </p>
<p>not miss the sudden change of personal pronouns at this point in the </p>
<p>letter. What began as “unless they repent of her ways” is then followed </p>
<p>with “all the churches will know,” which in turn is followed by “I will </p>
<p>repay each of you according to your deeds.” us, whether intended so </p>
<p>by John or not, lying at the center of the letters to the seven churches is </p>
<p>this word of both comfort and warning to them all. Now the appellation </p>
<p>at the beginning of the letter, “the words of the Son of God,” also makes </p>
<p>good sense. e one speaking these words to the believers in yatira </p>
<p>is at the same time speaking them to all the churches, and thus through </p>
<p>John to all the subsequent readers of this document. So also while it is </p>
<p>true that this clause comes at the end of the section of admonition, it </p>
<p>further serves as the appropriate lead-in to the words of encouragement </p>
<p>that follow.</p>
<p>To this point John’s concern has been with the inuence of </p>
<p>“Jezebel” on this community as a whole, and the description has been </p>
<p>all about her, both her false teaching and the Lord’s judgment on her; </p>
<p>and all of this for the sake of “all the churches.” But with verse 24 the </p>
