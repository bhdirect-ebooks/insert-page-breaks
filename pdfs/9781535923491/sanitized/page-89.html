<p>e rone in Heaven</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>The Throne in Heaven (4:1–6a)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Aer this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open </p>
<p>in heaven. And the voice I had rst heard speaking to me like a </p>
<p>trumpet said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take </p>
<p>place aer this.” </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me </p>
<p>was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>And the one </p>
<p>who sat there had the appearance of jasper and ruby. A rainbow </p>
<p>that shone like an emerald encircled the throne. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Surrounding the </p>
<p>throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were </p>
<p>twenty-four elders. ey were dressed in white and had crowns of </p>
<p>gold on their heads. </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>From the throne came ashes of lightning, </p>
<p>rumblings and peals of thunder. Before the throne, seven lamps </p>
<p>were blazing. ese are the seven spirits</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>of God.</p>
<p>6a</p>
<p>Also in front </p>
<p>of the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as </p>
<p>crystal.</p>
<p>Our chapter 4 is most oen referred to as “the vision of God,” and in truth </p>
<p>that is what it sets out to be. But in keeping with the Old Testament, and </p>
<p>especially the second commandment, John is careful not to try either </p>
<p>to describe or to imagine what God looks like. at is le totally to the </p>
<p>imagination—and the incarnation. In fact John does not say anything </p>
<p>about God as such, not even using language such as Daniel’s “Ancient of </p>
<p>Days.” Rather he speaks only of someone “sitting on [the throne]” (v. 2; </p>
<p>cf. vv. 9–10). at this is a stand-in for the eternal God is made known </p>
<p>by several features: rst, the One sitting on the throne is the central </p>
<p>reality in the entire vision; second, the heavenly beings in worship use </p>
<p>the language of “the Lord God Almighty,” acclaiming, “you are worthy, </p>
<p>our Lord and God” (v. 11); and third, in the second part of the vision </p>
<p>(ch. 5) the scroll that will unveil the future is “in the right hand of him </p>
<p>who sat on the throne.” us despite John’s reluctance to describe God, </p>
<p>God’s presence predominates in every way.</p>
<p>e primary Old Testament background for the way the present </p>
<p>vision is presented can be found in Isaiah 6:1–3 and Ezekiel 1:4–14 </p>
<p>and 22–28. e key to one’s hearing/seeing the vision, as well as to the </p>
<p>structure of the whole chapter, is a series of prepositions, all of which </p>
<p>are related in some way to the “throne”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>and “him who sits on” it: on</p>
<p>1. at is, the sevenfold Spirit.</p>
<p>2. is noun occurs 17 times in chs. 4–5, thus making it clear that it is the central </p>
<p>visual reality in this series of visions.</p>
