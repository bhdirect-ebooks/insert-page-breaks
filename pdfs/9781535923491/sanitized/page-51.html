<p>To the Church in Ephesus</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>what Adam and Eve were forbidden to do because of their failure to obey, </p>
<p>God’s redeemed people will experience as a restored Eden, where they </p>
<p>are now allowed to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise </p>
<p>of God. It is dicult to imagine a more striking and powerful imagery </p>
<p>than this one, with which John sets the tone for what he understood as </p>
<p>the ultimate concern of his Revelation. And again, even though this is </p>
<p>addressed to the believers in Ephesus, by the very nature of the book it </p>
<p>is equally intended for the others who were to read it.</p>
<p>To the Church in Smyrna (2:8–11)</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>“To the angel of the church in Smyrna write:</p>
<p>ese are the words of him who is the First and the Last, who </p>
<p>died and came to life again. </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>I know your aictions and your </p>
<p>poverty—yet you are rich! I know about the slander of those who </p>
<p>say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Do </p>
<p>not be afraid of what you are about to suer. I tell you, the devil </p>
<p>will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suer per-</p>
<p>secution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I </p>
<p>will give you life as your victor’s crown.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the </p>
<p>churches. ose who are victorious will not be hurt at all by the </p>
<p>second death.</p>
<p>John’s second letter is directed to the church in Smyrna, a city about </p>
<p>y miles north of Ephesus at the head of a deep gulf, and therefore with </p>
<p>an excellent harbor. In wealth, commercial importance, and splendor, it </p>
<p>was one of the foremost cities of Asia Minor. A temple in honor of the </p>
<p>emperor Tiberius had been granted the city in 20 CE; hence it had also </p>
<p>become a leading site for emperor worship. e origin of the church </p>
<p>itself is unknown, but is probably related to Paul’s mission to Ephesus </p>
<p>on one of his several stays there. e church in Smyrna is better known </p>
<p>to us in the years just beyond John’s time, through the letters of Ignatius </p>
<p>of Antioch. On his way to Rome for martyrdom Ignatius had stopped </p>
<p>for a short stay in Smyrna, where he also wrote four of his seven pre-</p>
<p>served letters. e letter he wrote back to the church in Smyrna and to </p>
<p>Polycarp, its “bishop,”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>when he traveled further north to Troas, on the</p>
<p>7. Polycarp himself was martyred for his faith ca. 155 CE.</p>
