<p>head. For John, therefore, the three functioned as a kind of a demonic </p>
parody of the divine Trinity.
<p>e Beast out of the Sea (13:1–10)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>e dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast com-</p>
<p>ing out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten </p>
<p>crowns on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>e </p>
<p>beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear </p>
<p>and a mouth like that of a lion. e dragon gave the beast his </p>
<p>power and his throne and great authority. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>One of the heads of the </p>
<p>beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had </p>
<p>been healed. e whole world was lled with wonder and followed </p>
<p>the beast. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p>People worshiped the dragon because he had given au-</p>
<p>thority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, </p>
<p>“Who is like the beast? Who can make war against it?”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>e beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and </p>
<p>blasphemies and to exercise its authority for forty-two months. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>It opened its mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander his name </p>
<p>and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven. </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>It was given </p>
<p>power to make war against God’s people and to conquer them. </p>
<p>And it was given authority over every tribe, people, language and </p>
<p>nation. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast—all </p>
<p>whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the </p>
<p>Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Whoever has ears, let them hear.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>“If anyone goes into captivity,</p>
<p> into captivity they will go.</p>
<p>If anyone is killed with the sword,</p>
<p> with the sword they will be killed.”</p>
<p>is calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of </p>
<p>God’s people.</p>
<p>Aer the considerable introduction with the two scenes in chapter 12, </p>
<p>and now picking up some of its imagery, John notes that the dragon, </p>
<p>introduced in 12:3 and identied as Satan in verse 9, stood on the shore </p>
<p>of the sea. He is positioned there because what John will see next is a </p>
<p>beast coming out of the sea, just as the second beast will “come out of </p>
<p>the earth.” is is a moment for which John has already been prepared </p>
<p>by the great angel in chapter 10, who stood with “his right foot on the </p>
