<p>ness in which an event occurs; nonetheless at the same time it carries a </p>
<p>temporal sense as well, so that one can be led by this word to think that </p>
<p>John expected the “coming” to be in the near future. And very likely </p>
<p>that is what he did indeed understand by it; aer all he is probably the </p>
<p>last living link to Christ himself, and the earliest churches apparently </p>
<p>looked on the Christ’s return as an event “just around the corner,” as it </p>
<p>were. And thus it continues to be “just around the corner” for all of us </p>
<p>who believe. For this reason, our continuing response should be that of </p>
<p>the apostle himself: Amen [so be it!]. Come, Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>With everything regarding the prophetic and apocalyptic nature of </p>
<p>the book now written, John concludes with the very common Christian </p>
<p>sign-o for letters: e grace of the Lord Jesus be with God’s people. </p>
<p>Amen. As always, “grace” is the basis of Christian faith and experience, </p>
<p>and therefore is what is desired for those to whom one writes, as was the </p>
<p>case regularly with the Apostle Paul, who signed o his earliest letter (1 </p>
<p>essalonians) with “e grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you,” </p>
<p>and the latest one attributed to him (2 Timothy) with “Grace be with </p>
<p>you all.” And so too does the writer of this commentary, to any who </p>
<p>would take the time to read this far into it. “May the grace of the Lord </p>
<p>Jesus be with all of God’s people. Amen.”</p>
