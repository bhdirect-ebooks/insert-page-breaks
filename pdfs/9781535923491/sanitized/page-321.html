<p>e New Jerusalem, the Bride of the Lamb</p>
<p>299</p>
<p>could be entered only once a year, and that only by the chief priest who </p>
<p>had to have a special ritual and take proper precautions, so as not to be </p>
<p>slain. Pictured here at last is the dwelling place of God with human be-</p>
<p>ings, as the “new Jerusalem” itself becomes the holy place, now available </p>
<p>to all of God’s people and for all time.</p>
<p>John then goes on to describe the precious stones of which the city </p>
<p>was constituted—no bricks and mortar here, but jewels of every imagin-</p>
<p>able kind. He begins by repeating what he had already noted about the </p>
<p>city’s appearance in verse 11, that the wall was made of jasper, whereas </p>
<p>the city itself was made of pure gold, as pure as glass (thus translucent </p>
<p>gold?). But at this point John’s real interests lie with the foundations, </p>
<p>since the “new Jerusalem” rests ultimately on the twelve apostles of the </p>
<p>Lamb. Nonetheless they are now imaged as decorated with every kind </p>
<p>of precious stone. By so doing, John has created a marvelous collage </p>
<p>out of the promise of a restored Jerusalem in Isaiah 54:11–12 and the </p>
<p>precious stones on the breastplate of the high priest in Exodus 28:17–20. </p>
<p>e Isaiah passage reads:</p>
<p>I will rebuild you with stones of turquoise,</p>
<p> your foundations with lapis lazuli.</p>
<p>I will make your battlements of rubies,</p>
<p> your gates of sparkling jewels</p>
<p> and all your walls of precious stones.</p>
<p>But in his listing of the precious stones that make up the foundation of </p>
<p>the “new Jerusalem,” John seems to have created another collage out </p>
<p>of the Septuagint and his own knowledge of the Hebrew. Perhaps the </p>
<p>easiest way for the contemporary reader to see what John has done is to </p>
<p>set his list side by side with that of the Exodus passage in the Septuagint. </p>
<p>us, with the order of appearance in the LXX in parentheses:</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>1) jasper (12)</p>
<p>2) sapphire</p>
<p>3) agate (8)</p>
<p>4) emerald (6)</p>
<p>5) onyx (11)</p>
<p>6) ruby</p>
<p>13. e two that dier are the present sapphire and ruby, where the LXX has car-</p>
<p>nelian and lapiz lazuli.</p>
