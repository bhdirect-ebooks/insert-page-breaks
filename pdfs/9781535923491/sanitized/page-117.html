<p>e Opening of the First Six Seals</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>vines were spared. If indeed this is the historical situation behind John’s </p>
<p>nal note, then this is now a word spoken directly to the emperor him-</p>
<p>self as to what not to do in a famine of grain. us the trees (producers </p>
<p>of olive oil) and the vines (producers of wine) are to be spared.</p>
<p>e climax of this series is nally reached when the Lamb opened </p>
<p>the fourth seal, and as one now expects, the nal voice, that of the </p>
<p>fourth living creature, signals for John to come! As John looked this </p>
<p>time, there before him was a pale horse. And to make sure that no </p>
<p>one misses the inevitable nal result of the sequence to this point, John </p>
<p>identies its rider’s name as Death. en, in keeping with the personi-</p>
<p>cation throughout, Hades was following close behind him. us the </p>
<p>picture is not that of people such as those in John’s Christian community </p>
<p>who had died, and would be in their graves awaiting resurrection, but </p>
<p>of those who have rejected Christ and have been assigned to “Hades.”</p>
<p>At the end of the scene John notes that the four riders</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>were</p>
<p>given power to bring death over a fourth of the earth. In apocalyptic </p>
<p>literature such a numerical gure is not intended to be precise; rather </p>
<p>it represents a large, but not complete, devastation that would be cre-</p>
<p>ated by God’s ultimate enemy, Satan. e deaths are then attributed to </p>
<p>three sources, thus picking up the devastations caused by the nal three </p>
<p>horses: human destruction (to kill by the sword), so-called natural di-</p>
<p>sasters (famine and plague—note especially how the latter follows the </p>
<p>former), and becoming prey to the wild beasts of the earth.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Although</p>
<p>one cannot be sure why John added this nal dimension to the devasta-</p>
<p>tion, it most likely simply points to reality; in a famine the “wild beasts </p>
<p>of the earth” will feed on human beings themselves.</p>
<p>One should note at the end that the alleged theological problem </p>
<p>raised by the preceding description—the four horsemen as being called </p>
<p>forth by Christ—is more of our own making than John’s. His pictures </p>
<p>are not intended to be a precise, blow-by-blow account of the future. </p>
<p>Rather, he is trying to portray the larger realities that will one day take </p>
<p>place on the earth; and in order to get there, John uses this vivid imag-</p>
<p>34. At least that seems to be the most likely option with regard to John’s ambigu-</p>
<p>ous “they,” which could also be limited simply to “Death and Hades,” as the NIV itself </p>
<p>seems to imply.</p>
<p>35. With these disasters John is once more borrowing from Ezekiel, this time 14:21: </p>
<p>“when I send against Jerusalem my four dreadful judgments—sword and famine and </p>
<p>wild beasts and plague.”</p>
