<p>Revelation 1:9–11</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>of Rome, since the latter’s rule is only temporal, and thus temporary. </p>
<p>Finally, John is also their companion in patient endurance, another </p>
<p>word that will recur in the letters to the seven churches (2:2–3; 2:19; </p>
<p>3:10) and will be part of the reminder vis-à-vis emperor worship in </p>
<p>14:12.</p>
<p>Notably, each of these realities (suering, the kingdom, and endur-</p>
<p>ance) nds its place and signicance as ours in Jesus. us whatever else </p>
<p>may be true of John as a Christian prophet, he is also part of a believing </p>
<p>community with whom he shares both the life of the kingdom and the </p>
<p>associated hostility from the same Empire that executed their Lord. It is </p>
<p>of further interest that this designation of our Lord by his earthly name </p>
<p>alone, which will recur at the end of the verse, will appear seven more </p>
<p>times in the Revelation,</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>and in each instance it has to do with his own</p>
<p>“witness,” or “testimony,” as in the rest of the present sentence.</p>
<p>At the same time John also locates himself geographically: I . . . </p>
<p>was on the island of Patmos. is is a little piece of land in the Aegean </p>
<p>Sea about forty miles southwest of Ephesus. Whether it was otherwise </p>
<p>inhabited in John’s day cannot be known, since it is basically a moun-</p>
<p>tain crest jutting up out of the sea, about eight miles long and ve miles </p>
<p>wide and shaped like an elongated C. John’s presence there suggests that </p>
<p>it was probably used by the Romans as a penal colony, whose amenities </p>
<p>in John’s day simply cannot be known. It was almost certainly under the </p>
<p>political jurisdiction of the province of Asia, and thus of Ephesus. e </p>
<p>reason John was a prisoner on Patmos is clear enough—because he was </p>
<p>a follower of the risen Christ. His way of putting it is simply to repeat </p>
<p>what he says about the present book in verse 2 (q.v.): because of the </p>
<p>word of God and the testimony of Jesus.</p>
<p>Finally, John locates himself temporally and spiritually, as being in </p>
<p>the Spirit on the Lord’s Day. is is the rst known instance in writ-</p>
<p>ten history of the term “the Lord’s Day,” which only by the mid-second </p>
<p>century</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>is used undoubtedly as a term to refer to Sunday, as the day</p>
<p>on which the resurrection took place—or at least the day the tomb was </p>
<p>discovered to be empty, since we do not know when the resurrection </p>
<p>itself happened. Two items are especially noteworthy here. First, the </p>
<p>English possessive “the Lord’s” is not in the Greek genitive (possessive) </p>
<p>9. See at the end of this verse, plus 12:17; 14:12; 17:6; 19:10 (2x); 20:4; and 21:16.</p>
<p>10. In the apocryphal Gospel of Peter 35 and 50, although it might appear earlier in </p>
<p>Ignatius’s Letter to the Magnesians, in a reference that is in considerable dispute.</p>
