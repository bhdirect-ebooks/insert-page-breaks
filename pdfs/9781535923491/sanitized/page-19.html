<p>Gospel and three Epistles, but they disliked the Revelation and so found </p>
<p>reasons to deny it to him.</p>
<p>Although this matter will never be settled to everyone’s satisfac-</p>
<p>tion, the position assumed in this commentary is that the John who </p>
<p>identies himself in 1:4 simply as “John” is in fact the apostle we meet in </p>
<p>the Synoptic Gospels. Furthermore, along with the majority of believers </p>
<p>through all the early Christian centuries, the assumption made here is </p>
<p>that he is the same John who authored the Gospel and the three letters </p>
<p>attributed to him. e primary reason one might think otherwise is that </p>
<p>while the Greek of this document is basically (even overwhelmingly, </p>
<p>from my perspective) like that of the Fourth Gospel, it has just enough </p>
<p>small dierences from the other four documents to cause some to have </p>
<p>doubts. Although these dierences are noteworthy, and must be dealt </p>
<p>with, they are scarcely of the same nature as the dierences between the </p>
<p>three Pastoral Epistles and the other ten letters in the Pauline corpus. It </p>
<p>may therefore be said with some degree of assurance that the real rea-</p>
<p>son some early church fathers rejected authorship of this book by the </p>
<p>Apostle John is that noted above—they thoroughly disliked its content </p>
<p>(mostly because they simply did not understand it) and therefore were </p>
<p>glad to distance the Apocalypse from the apostle.</p>
<p>What makes one nally move in the direction of apostolic author-</p>
<p>ship is the twofold reality, rst, that this very unusual document was </p>
<p>preserved in the early church as something apostolic, and second, that </p>
<p>even though it has several linguistic and grammatical dierences from </p>
<p>the Gospel and Epistles that bear John’s name, these dierences are no </p>
<p>more severe than those between Galatians and Romans, both of which </p>
<p>almost all living scholars assume to be Pauline. And with regard to the </p>
<p>Revelation, one could argue further that the small dierences between </p>
<p>it and the Gospel of John can easily be attributed to John’s exile on </p>
<p>Patmos, where he probably had to write on his own without an amanu-</p>
<p>ensis. In any case, the strongest historical argument in favor of apostolic </p>
<p>authorship is the very preservation of the document by the early church </p>
<p>at all. For a document as dierent from the rest of the New Testament </p>
<p>writings as this one to have been preserved in such a way as to eventu-</p>
<p>ally be included in the canon of New Testament writings suggests that </p>
<p>the preservation was done by those who revered the Apostle John, and </p>
<p>kept it and copied it basically for that reason.</p>
