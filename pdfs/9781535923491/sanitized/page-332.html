<p>Revelation 22:6–11</p>
<p>310</p>
<p>book, that in light of what followers of the Slain Lamb are currently </p>
<p>experiencing at the hands of the Empire, matters for them are going to </p>
<p>continue to get worse, far worse, before God makes them better. </p>
<p>Hence the concluding admonition is to the wicked, rst regarding </p>
<p>their conduct (let those who do wrong continue to do wrong), and </p>
<p>then regarding their character (let those who are vile continue to be </p>
<p>vile), since their future is spelled out 20:7–15: they are headed for the </p>
<p>Last Battle, aer which they will join Satan and the Empire in the lake </p>
<p>of re. is is followed by similar words to believers, having to do rst </p>
<p>with their conduct (let those who do right continue to do right) and </p>
<p>then with their character (let those who are holy continue to be holy); </p>
<p>all of which is quite in keeping with John’s Gospel, where the true fol-</p>
<p>lowers of the Lamb live in keeping with the life and character of the </p>
<p>Lamb.</p>
<p>The Last Words of Christ (22:12–16)</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>“Look, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will </p>
<p>give to everyone according to what they have done. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>I am the </p>
<p>Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and </p>
<p>the End.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>“Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have </p>
<p>the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the </p>
<p>city. </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the </p>
<p>sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who </p>
<p>loves and practices falsehood.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>“I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for </p>
<p>the churches. I am the Root and the Ospring of David, and the </p>
<p>bright Morning Star.”</p>
<p>Before John’s own nal wrap-up of his Apocalypse, the “last words” in </p>
<p>the narrative itself belong to the Risen Savior, which are also the rst </p>
<p>words he has spoken since 1:17–20. As with the immediately preceding </p>
<p>materials, these “words” also come to us in three parts. In verses 12–13 </p>
<p>Christ announces his coming, part of the reason for which now is to re-</p>
<p>ward his own. Verses 14–15 then oer the nal beatitude, which in this </p>
<p>case has inherent in it the nal curse as well. Verse 16 then returns the </p>
<p>readers (“you” in this verse is plural) to two of the earlier identications </p>
<p>of Christ: as the one who sent his angel to John for this vision (1:1), and </p>
<p>as the Davidic Messiah in 1:3 and 2:28.</p>
