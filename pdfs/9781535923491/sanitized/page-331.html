<p>John and the Angel</p>
<p>309</p>
<p>He then follows the armation with the sixth of the seven beati-</p>
<p>tudes in the book.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>e armation also serves as a further inclusio with</p>
<p>the content of the opening beatitude in 1:3. ere the blessing was for </p>
<p>those “who hear [the words of this prophecy] and take to heart what is </p>
<p>written in it”; here it is blessed are those who keep the words of the </p>
<p>prophecy in this scroll. “Keep,” of course, is the crucial verb, but it is </p>
<p>also as nicely ambiguous in Greek as it is in English, since it can mean </p>
<p>either “preserve” these words or “live in obedience to” them. Most </p>
<p>likely John is here concerned about the latter, since by the very nature </p>
<p>of things that would also include the former.</p>
<p>e next word in this set of conclusions is the author’s own, which </p>
<p>is rst of all an armation: I, John, am the one who heard and saw </p>
<p>these things. ese two verbs, “heard” and “saw,” cover all the ground </p>
<p>in the preceding narrative, and oen, as here, occur together. “ese </p>
<p>things” in this case almost certainly includes all the visions that have </p>
<p>preceded, which are now condensed into a panoramic vision of the </p>
<p>whole. en, with a near repetition of 19:10 (q.v.), John does it again—</p>
<p>he oers worship at the wrong place and to the wrong being. us, aer </p>
<p>he had heard and seen them, he once more fell down to worship at </p>
<p>the feet of the angel who had been showing these things to him. And </p>
<p>once more he gets the same response from the angel: Don’t do that!, </p>
<p>followed again by I am a fellow servant with you; but this time, instead </p>
<p>of “and with your brothers and sisters,” the angel adds, and with your </p>
<p>fellow prophets, to which he further adds, and of all who keep the </p>
<p>words of this scroll, concluding again with the command to worship </p>
<p>God. us the angel recognizes his own role as “a fellow servant” with </p>
<p>John and (reaching out to John’s readers) with “all who keep the words </p>
<p>of this scroll.”</p>
<p>To this the angel adds yet a further word, which at the same time </p>
<p>anticipates the rest of the epilogue. John is rst commanded, Do not </p>
<p>seal up the words of the prophecy of this scroll, the reason being be-</p>
<p>cause the time is near. Here is a word (“near”) that has tended to fall </p>
<p>on bad days among later interpreters, who tend to read it in light of </p>
<p>what has most recently preceded (19:11–20:15 plus the eschatological </p>
<p>pictures of 21:1–22:5). But in light of the whole book, that seems to be </p>
<p>a misreading. What is near are the events prophesied throughout the </p>
<p>1. For the others see 1:3; 14:13; 16:15; 19:9; 20:6; and 22:14.</p>
