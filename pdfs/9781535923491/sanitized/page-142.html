<p>Revelation 8:1–5</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>previously mentioned seven angels.” A goodly number of interpreters </p>
<p>have regarded them as having a backward look, thus as referring to the </p>
<p>seven lamps, but that seems to founder on any number of exegetical </p>
<p>problems. More likely John is here referring to the seven archangels, </p>
<p>who were well known in late Jewish antiquity, and who are actually </p>
<p>named in 1 Enoch 20.</p>
<p>Although the meaning—and background—of the “seven trum-</p>
<p>pets” has also been a point of some dierence among interpreters, the </p>
<p>most likely option is to be found in several texts in the Prophets, where </p>
<p>warnings of judgment are accompanied by a trumpet blast. us, for </p>
<p>example, in Ezekiel 33:1–5 the watchman will “blow the trumpet to </p>
<p>warn the people”; and in Zephaniah 1:14–16 the “great day of the Lord” </p>
<p>will be “a day of trumpet and battle cry” (cf. Joel 2:1; 2 Esdras 5:23). If </p>
<p>this is the way forward, then the dierence between the trumpets and </p>
<p>the coming “seven bowls” (ch. 16) is that the former only announce the </p>
<p>coming judgments, and inherent in them is the opportunity to hear </p>
<p>them as warning. What further supports this view is that when the </p>
<p>trumpets are sounded only one third of the earth will be aected and </p>
<p>people are regularly oered opportunity to repent, even though they do </p>
<p>not (e.g., 9:20–21); while the later “bowls of wrath” are poured out as </p>
divine judgment, with no relief of any kind.
<p>e seven angels are then followed by another angel, who has </p>
<p>sometimes been interpreted as referring to Christ, a view that has al-</p>
<p>most nothing in its favor. In this book, “angels” are angels, and Christ </p>
<p>appears either in his incarnate form or as the Lion or the Lamb. Indeed, </p>
<p>as with the seven seals, the seven trumpets originate from the heavenly </p>
<p>throne. What has now changed is the imagery itself: heaven now ap-</p>
<p>pears as a temple, an image that was anticipated in 5:8; the bowls of </p>
<p>incense are the prayers of the saints; and in 6:9 John sees “under the </p>
<p>altar the souls of the martyrs.” In the present scene the angel who had a </p>
<p>golden censer came as a priest ministering in the temple and stood at . . </p>
<p>. the golden altar in front of the throne. e angel had also been given </p>
<p>much incense to oer, which is intended to accompany the prayers of </p>
<p>God’s people.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Although this sentence reads quite naturally, presenting</p>
<p>1. John here seems to be echoing Ps 141:2, where the psalmist prays, “May my </p>
<p>prayer be set before you like incense.” e term “God’s people” at this point is the </p>
<p>NIV’s mediating compromise between the traditional rendering of this phrase as “the </p>
<p>saints” and the more precise term “God’s holy ones,” both of which are terms loaded </p>
