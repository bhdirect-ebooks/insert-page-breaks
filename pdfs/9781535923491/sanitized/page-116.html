<p>Revelation 6:1–17</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>When the Lamb opened the second seal, John heard the second </p>
<p>living creature say, “Come!” What follows in this second instance is </p>
<p>unique to the series. Instead of the repeated, “I looked, and there be-</p>
<p>fore me,” John says simply, then another horse came out, whose rider, </p>
<p>in keeping with the scheme of color identications, is atop a ery red </p>
<p>horse. e further description of him makes it clear that he represents </p>
<p>war itself, since he was given power to take peace from the earth by </p>
<p>making people kill each other. Almost as an aerthought, John adds </p>
<p>a note about the weapon by which he was identied as the ultimate </p>
<p>human power: To him was given a large sword. One would not need </p>
<p>to know much about “ancient history”</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>to recognize these rst two</p>
<p>horsemen as representing the Roman Empire, which was at its peak of </p>
<p>conquest and domination of the Western world at the time John was </p>
<p>writing from Patmos as a prisoner of the state.</p>
<p>With the opening of the third seal and the invitation to come! </p>
<p>from the third living creature, John moves toward something pro-</p>
<p>phetic, as he sees the inevitable outcome of the activities of the previ-</p>
<p>ous riders. e next rider therefore sits atop a black horse, imagery </p>
<p>that depicts famine at its worst. In what evolves into the longest of the </p>
<p>four descriptions, John elaborates on the inevitable outcome of Rome’s </p>
<p>greed and exploitation, expressed here with especially poignant imag-</p>
<p>ery: Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand. At rst reading </p>
<p>one might be tempted to think that here the Empire itself was to be </p>
<p>“weighed and found wanting”; but what rather seems intended by this </p>
<p>description is a prophetic judgment on Rome for its scal and imperial </p>
<p>ways. Indeed, what is prophesied is a famine of such severity that one </p>
<p>“denarius,” which elsewhere in the New Testament represents a day ’s </p>
<p>wages, will buy only a small amount or wheat or barley. e picture is </p>
<p>therefore one of severe famine, which is moderated only slightly by the </p>
<p>nal, especially puzzling imperative, do not damage the oil and wine. </p>
<p>Among the many options that interpreters have oered for this unusual </p>
<p>moment, the most likely would seem to be a historical reection on </p>
<p>the furor created by the emperor Domitian in 92 CE when he ordered </p>
<p>half the vineyards in the province of Asia (of which Ephesus was the </p>
<p>capital) to be cut down so that he could increase the wheat supply for </p>
<p>the Empire. Fortunately the good sense of others prevailed, so that the </p>

<p>classes when I matriculated in college some 55 years ago.</p>
