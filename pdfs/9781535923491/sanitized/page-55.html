<p>To the Church in Pergamum</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>ese are the words of him who has the sharp, double-edged </p>
<p>sword. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>I know where you live—where Satan has his throne. Yet </p>
<p>you remain true to my name. You did not renounce your faith in </p>
<p>me, even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put </p>
<p>to death in your city—where Satan lives.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: ere are </p>
<p>some among you who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught </p>
<p>Balak to entice the Israelites to sin so that they ate food sacriced </p>
<p>to idols and committed sexual immorality. </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Likewise, you also </p>
<p>have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans. </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Repent </p>
<p>therefore! Otherwise, I will soon come to you and will ght against </p>
<p>them with the sword of my mouth.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the </p>
<p>churches. To those who are victorious, I will give some of the hid-</p>
<p>den manna. I will also give each of them a white stone with a new </p>
<p>name written on it, known only to the one who receives it.</p>
<p>By John’s time Pergamum had been a city of considerable importance </p>
<p>for at least the four preceding centuries. Perched atop a considerable </p>
<p>acropolis twelve miles inland from the Aegean Sea, it served as the seat </p>
<p>of the Attalid empire, whose kings were major players in the events </p>
<p>of Asia Minor during the latter period of the Hellenistic empire and </p>
<p>on into the Roman. Its last Attalid kings had bequeathed their city to </p>
<p>Rome, who made it their seat of government for the province of Asia </p>
<p>(although this was always being contested by Ephesus). A temple to </p>
<p>the imperial cult was built in 29 BCE in honor of Rome and Caesar </p>
<p>Augustus; eventually, shortly aer John’s time, a splendid temple to </p>
<p>Trajan had been constructed, thus ensuring the ongoing worship of the </p>
<p>emperor. Before that the city already had signicant temples dedicated </p>
<p>to Zeus, Athena, Dionysius, and Asclepius; the temple of the latter, be-</p>
<p>ing the “god of healing,” was a special attraction, vying in importance </p>
<p>with the Ascelpion in Corinth.</p>
<p>In this, the second of only two of the letters where Christ’s words </p>
<p>do not begin with “I know your deeds,” what is expressed rather is I </p>
<p>know where you live. In his description of Pergamum John uses lan-</p>
<p>guage (twice in v. 13) to emphasize its satanic nature: where Satan has </p>
<p>his throne and your city where Satan lives. ese appellations seem to </p>
<p>be intentionally related to one or more of the phenomena noted above, </p>
<p>referring either to the temple of Zeus with its imposing altar-platform </p>
<p>(still an imposing sight even in ruins), or to its being a conspicuous seat </p>
