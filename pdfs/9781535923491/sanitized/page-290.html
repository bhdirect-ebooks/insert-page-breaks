<p>Revelation 18:1—19:10</p>
<p>268</p>
<p>signicantly, “the angel” who is now speaking to John is the same one </p>
<p>who spoke to him in 17:1, identied there as “one of the seven angels </p>
<p>who had the seven bowls.” e signicance, of course, rests with the fact </p>
<p>that this beatitude, which has to do with an invitation to the wedding </p>
<p>supper of the Lamb, stands at the conclusion of a narrative that began </p>
<p>with the harlot holding in her hands a golden cup that was “lled with </p>
<p>abominable things.”</p>
<p>Here, then, is the true royal wedding banquet, and the benediction </p>
<p>is for those who have been invited, namely, John’s own readers in the </p>
<p>seven churches—and by extension all others who in all generations are </p>
<p>followers of the Lamb. Here at last is the eschatological feast to which </p>
<p>the many meals in the life of Jesus pointed, as does the Lord’s Supper </p>
<p>itself, which is to be eaten as an ongoing reminder of “his death, until </p>
<p>he comes.”</p>
<p>But an invitation to the eschatological banquet is not the nal word; </p>
<p>rather the angel added, “ese are the true words of God.” Although </p>
<p>this addition is primarily intended to bring closure to the vision that </p>
<p>began in 17:1, at the same time it takes the reader back to the beginning </p>
<p>of the book, where John introduces his narrative as “the word of God,” </p>
<p>which almost certainly means “the word from God.” John’s point, then, </p>
<p>is that here as throughout what he has seen and written down is to be </p>
<p>taken seriously as “the true words of God,” that is, words that God has </p>
<p>spoken, and therefore by the very nature of things are true.</p>
<p>In typical fashion, but also to stress a point made earlier, John </p>
<p>narrates that at this I fell at his feet to worship him, a verb that in </p>
<p>this case would have meant something like “do him homage.” Since this </p>
<p>little piece of narrative is so completely unnecessary to the story itself, </p>
<p>one may perhaps rightly wonder whether this serves also to warn his </p>
<p>readers against any form of “the worship of angels,” of the kind that the </p>
<p>Apostle Paul had encountered in Colossae (Col 3:18), a neighboring </p>
<p>town to the Laodicea to whose believers John is writing. In any case, </p>
<p>John is scolded by the angel, Don’t do that! e Creator alone is to be </p>
<p>worshiped; every other being, heavenly and earthly, is to be recognized </p>
<p>as a fellow servant with you, which in this case is elaborated for John’s </p>
<p>sake to include your brothers and sisters who hold to Jesus’ testimo-</p>
<p>ny. e latter phrase, which is ambiguous in both Greek and English, </p>
<p>almost certainly refers not to a second party’s bearing witness to Christ, </p>
<p>but to the witness that he himself bore, both by word and (ultimately) </p>
