<p>e Opening of the First Six Seals</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>from sight to sound, as one of the four living creatures speaks in a </p>
<p>voice like thunder, inviting John to come!</p>
<p>Next, moving back from sound to sight, John looked, and there </p>
<p>before me was a white horse, followed by a description of its rider. e </p>
<p>description is in three parts, and with these, combined with the “white </p>
<p>horse,” most of the diculties begin for later readers. John begins by </p>
<p>noting that in his hand the horseman held a bow, which is elaborated </p>
<p>by the third descriptor: he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest. </p>
<p>ese two surround the more dicult one, that he was given a crown, </p>
<p>the rst of two such passives (for this and the next horseman). But in </p>
<p>light of the summary sentence at the end (v. 8b) the passives seem to </p>
<p>include all four riders. Although this may be nothing more than a way </p>
<p>of indicating that the horsemen had power to conquer, it seems highly </p>
<p>likely, in light of 13:2, that John assumes Satan to be the actual giver of </p>
<p>power; yet it is expressed in passives because nothing lies outside God’s </p>
<p>own eternal sovereignty.</p>
<p>e ultimate question here has to do with who this rider is in-</p>
<p>tended to represent, a diculty that stems from the combination of the </p>
<p>color white and the fact that “he was given a crown.” Since the latter </p>
<p>seems intended to identify him as someone with ruling authority, the </p>
<p>real issue has to do with the color white, which elsewhere is either the </p>
<p>color of eschatological victory (see 3:4–5, 18; 6:11; 7:9, 13) or the color </p>
<p>reserved for Christ (1:14; and esp. 19:11). But in the present narrative </p>
<p>this can hardly be a picture of Christ; aer all, Christ is the Lamb who </p>
<p>opens the seals, and therefore even in apocalyptic literature cannot at </p>
<p>the same time be this horseman. Moreover, this horseman belongs to </p>
<p>a sequence that nally ends in death and leads to the martyrs’ cry in </p>
<p>verses 9–10. But if he not Christ, who then? e best answer seems to </p>
<p>be that John intends this gure to be a demonic parody of Christ, just as </p>
<p>the beast in chapter 12 is presented as a parody of the Lamb. If so, then </p>
<p>this rst gure, which points ultimately to the Roman Empire, is part </p>
<p>of the overture that depicts, and thus anticipates, the awful events that </p>
<p>are to follow. Such an understanding seems conrmed by the h and </p>
<p>sixth seals, which anticipate the two major concerns of the whole book: </p>
<p>the persecution and suering of God’s people, and God’s judgment on </p>
<p>their persecutors. us these four horsemen logically precede the next </p>
<p>two seals as the cause of the martyrs’ suering.</p>
