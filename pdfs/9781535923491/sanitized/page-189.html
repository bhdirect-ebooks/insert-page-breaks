<p>e Sun-Clothed Woman and the Dragon</p>
<p>167</p>
<p>whom Satan would devour is instead protected by God his Father, and </p>
<p>he eventually defeats Satan through his death and resurrection.</p>
<p>But the story is not over with the ascension—indeed, for the fol-</p>
<p>lowers of the Lamb it is only the beginning, as it were. us the present </p>
<p>scene concludes with the ight of the woman . . . into the wilderness </p>
<p>to a place prepared for her by God. e more puzzling feature of this </p>
<p>part of the narrative lies with the conclusion, that in the wilderness she </p>
<p>might be taken care of for 1,260 days (three and a half years), which </p>
<p>is the same time frame as that of the trampling of the Holy City and the </p>
<p>period in which the two witnesses will prophesy in 11:2–3. As before, </p>
<p>this is probably a reference to the period for the newly formed people of </p>
<p>God to bear witness to the Israel that gave birth to the Messiah.</p>
<p>The Defeat of the Dragon in Heaven (12:7–12)</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>War</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the</p>
<p>dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>But he was </p>
<p>not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>e great </p>
<p>dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, </p>
<p>or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the </p>
<p>earth, and his angels with him.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>en I heard a loud voice in heaven say:</p>
<p>“Now have come the salvation and the power </p>
<p> and the kingdom of our God,</p>
<p> and the authority of his Messiah.</p>
<p>For the accuser of our brothers and sisters,</p>
<p> who accuses them before our God day and night,</p>
<p> has been hurled down.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>ey triumphed over him </p>
<p> by the blood of the Lamb</p>
<p> and by the word of their testimony;</p>
<p>they did not love their lives so much</p>
<p> as to shrink from death.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>erefore, rejoice, you heavens</p>
<p> and you who dwell in them!</p>
<p>6. It is of some interest that the original NIV translators chose to include John’s </p>
<p>“and” at t he beginning of this sentence, since in fact every sentence in the entire chap-</p>
<p>ter (except for the song in vv. 10–11) begins with a kai (“and”). So why here only, one </p>
<p>wonders, especially since the “and” is rendered “but” (properly so) at the beginning </p>
<p>of v. 8.</p>
