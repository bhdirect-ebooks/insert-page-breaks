<p>Revelation 14:1–13</p>
<p>188</p>
<p>Two Interlude Visions (14:1–13)</p>
<p>What happens next in John’s narrative appears to be something like two </p>
<p>interlude visions between the warnings of chapter 13 and the nal set </p>
<p>of seven woes in chapters 15–16, where he spells out God’s intended </p>
<p>judgments on the Empire itself. is set of visions, therefore, which </p>
<p>rst of all respond to what has preceded, at the same time prepare the </p>
<p>reader for the nal (but original!) “tale of two cities”—the city of “man” </p>
<p>and the city of God. us these interlude visions are not as disparate as </p>
<p>they might appear at rst reading. e rst one in particular seems to </p>
<p>function as something of a postlude to the preceding judgments on the </p>
<p>Empire and emperor worship. Indeed, together with the preceding two </p>
<p>chapters they oer the theological/prophetic center of things for John. </p>
<p>Here at last are the theological explanations of God’s coming judgments, </p>
in which the martyrs are accorded their special place in the divine de-
<p>sign. In eect John is now oering his own “tale of the martyrs.”</p>
<p>In this regard, and thus in keeping with the Old Testament pro-</p>
<p>phetic tradition in general, John simply does not the let the pictures of </p>
<p>grim darkness for God’s people (ch. 13) go very long without lightening </p>
the load with equally signicant visions of divine blessedness. So just as
<p>Amos 9:11–16 follows the unrelenting judgments that had preceded it, </p>
<p>and Isaiah 1:1–31 is followed by 2:1–5 (cf. Isa 4:2–6 following 2:6–4:1), </p>
<p>so here the gruesome pictures of chapter 13 are followed by a picture of </p>
<p>eschatological victory, as the contrasts between the two kinds of marks </p>
<p>on the foreheads seem to make certain. e single great—and truly </p>
<p>signicant—dierence between what his prophetic predecessors were </p>
<p>doing and what John does is that in the former case the “bad guys” </p>
<p>were most oen the Israelites themselves, whereas in John’s case it is the </p>
<p>satanically driven policies of the Empire.</p>
<p>At the center of everything is Christ and his defeat of Satan pic-</p>
<p>tured in chapter 12. But those who follow Christ are themselves follow-</p>
<p>ers of the Slain Lamb, and therefore they may well expect that Satan, by </p>
<p>the very nature of things, will pour out his wrath on the followers of the </p>
<p>Lamb. And he will do this through his associates, the Empire and its </p>
<p>emperors who have become both rulers and objects of worship. So what </p>
<p>ensues is a series of snapshots, as it were, of coming realities. First up is </p>
<p>a prophetic vision regarding the martyrs (vv. 1–5), who are described so </p>
<p>as to stand in deliberate contrast to the preceding two scenes, and who </p>
