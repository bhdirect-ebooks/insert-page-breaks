<p>e Fall of Babylon the Great</p>
<p>255</p>
<p>olive oil (local, but by end of rst century vast imports</p>
<p> from Africa and Spain)</p>
<p> ne our (Egypt)</p>
<p> wheat (Egypt)</p>
<p> cattle (for large ranches; breeding purposes, work)</p>
<p> sheep (again, large ranches, nest breeds imported)</p>
<p>6) Horses, carriages, slaves</p>
<p> horses (from several places, for the races in the circus)</p>
<p>carriages (the word used denotes expensive horse-driven</p>
<p> carriages of the wealthy)</p>
<p>human beings sold as slaves (from conquest, foundlings;</p>
<p> for their large estates)</p>
<p>Here is a case where the list tells its own story, and little comment </p>
<p>is needed.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>What needs to be pointed out again is that this list is not</p>
<p>about the shoemaker or the baker or the household slave. is is about </p>
<p>the fabulously wealthy, those who in every culture consider themselves </p>
<p>as worth all they get, and who very oen consider the rest of the world </p>
<p>as somewhere beneath them. But John’s concern here is not with the </p>
<p>consumers themselves, but with the “merchants of the earth,” those </p>
<p>whose money comes from their dealing in such wares.</p>
<p>What happens next is something of a grammatical conundrum, </p>
<p>since it is addressed in the second-person singular, and almost certainly </p>
<p>to Rome itself, but without a notation as to the speaker. Most English </p>
<p>translations (including the NIV) understand this to be the collective </p>
<p>voice of the “merchants of the earth” who will “weep and mourn over </p>
<p>[Rome] because no one buys their cargoes any more.” But one wonders </p>
<p>whether this is not to be understood as the voice of John himself, who </p>
<p>at the end of the litany of losses speaks prophetically to the city at the </p>
<p>very height of her glory. at this is the more likely scenario is sup-</p>
<p>ported by the follow-up sentence, where John returns to the merchants </p>
<p>themselves, indicating their own woe over the loss of the city.</p>
<p>In this view John, himself moved by the litany of losses of both </p>
<p>the necessities and luxuries that marked Rome, steps into his role as </p>
<p>16. Although I have gone over this list with my classes over several years, I was </p>
<p>struck again in putting it together for the commentary how much John knew about his </p>
<p>culture, especially about the nature and dealings of the wealthy.</p>
