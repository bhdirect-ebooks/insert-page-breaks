<p>Revelation 18:1—19:10</p>
<p>266</p>
<p>whole populace of heaven to praise our God, whereas the worshipers </p>
<p>themselves are identied simply as all you his servants, you who fear </p>
<p>him, both great and small! As with such moments elsewhere in the </p>
<p>book, this interlude moment serves as a kind of formal introduction, </p>
<p>plus invitation, for John’s readers and everyone else to join in the nal </p>
<p>“hallelujah” that follows.</p>
<p>us the climax of the threefold “hallelujah” is reached with the </p>
<p>nal thing that he heard, which sounded like a great multitude. John’s </p>
<p>emphasis here, however, is not with the size of the worshiping group </p>
<p>itself, but with their acclamation; thus he introduces their contribution </p>
<p>of praise in terms of its volume: like the roar of rushing waters and </p>
<p>like loud peals of thunder (waterfalls and thunderstorms!). And to get </p>
<p>the point across, the NIV translators (correctly) rendered John’s literal </p>
<p>“saying” as shouting the third and nal hallelujah! is is followed im-</p>
<p>mediately by the reason for such praise, and then by an invitation to </p>
<p>worship, followed by a wedding announcement, the invitation to which </p>
<p>is implied in the announcement itself.</p>
<p>e reason for praise serves as a kind of heading for both this -</p>
<p>nal armation and for the coming conclusion to the book as a whole. </p>
<p>John’s primary point is that the reign of God that was understood to </p>
<p>have come historically through Christ (see on 11:15 and 12:10 above) </p>
<p>is now being pictured as coming to its eschatological conclusion. us </p>
<p>with a direct recall of these two prior moments, John announces the </p>
<p>ultimate reason for the nal hallelujah, namely, for not simply the Lord, </p>
<p>but our Lord reigns. As before, the “Lord” in this case is further identi-</p>
<p>ed as God Almighty. And precisely because God, not Caesar, reigns, </p>
<p>God’s own people are invited rst of all to rejoice and be glad, despite </p>
<p>their present circumstances. Not only so, but especially they are to give </p>
<p>him glory, which of course means not that we have something to oer </p>
<p>God as such, but that his redeemed ones have the privilege of joining </p>
<p>“the great multitude in heaven” of “giving all glory” to the One who </p>
<p>alone deserves such praise and adoration.</p>
<p>What comes next, typically so in this book, serves both as the con-</p>
<p>cluding word to the “tale of the rst city,” and as an anticipatory word </p>
<p>for the “tale of the second city” to follow shortly. John’s point for his </p>
<p>readers is almost certainly that the eventual fall of Rome is to be un-</p>
<p>derstood in light of these eschatological realities, in which God’s people </p>
<p>are major participants. us a series of hallelujahs that began with a </p>
