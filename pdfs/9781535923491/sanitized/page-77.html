<p>To the Church in Philadelphia</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>e nal word to this church (v. 10) before the concluding words of </p>
<p>promise</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>takes the form of an admonition—the only one in this letter.</p>
<p>In light of the fact that Christ is coming soon,</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>they are urged to hold</p>
<p>on to what you have, so that no one will take your crown. Although </p>
<p>this is perfectly understandable English, just as is the Greek itself, the </p>
<p>nal clause of this sentence is especially puzzling. Had the Lord said, </p>
<p>“so that you will not lose your crown,” that would have made good sense </p>
<p>in the context; but what it would mean for “no one to take your crown” </p>
<p>is not at all clear—although it is very likely that the former is what </p>
<p>John intended, despite the actual wording. Most likely this is a kind of </p>
shorthand for the fact that the divine giver is also the divine taker; or
<p>in the language of the KJV on which I was raised, God is the one who </p>
<p>“giveth” and “taketh away” (Job 1:21). Finally, as throughout the New </p>
<p>Testament, the “crown” the victor receives is not the diadem worn by </p>
<p>kings or queens, but the wreath given the victor in the games.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>e promise to the victors in this case (v. 12) is full of echoes of </p>
<p>the Philadelphians’ own history, while at the same time it altogether an-</p>
<p>ticipates chapters 21–22 at the end of the book. e rst two promises </p>
<p>are especially tting for the church in earthquake-prone Philadelphia. </p>
<p>First, Christ says, I will make them pillars in the temple of my God. </p>
<p>e very language anticipates a stability of the kind Philadelphians </p>
<p>knew but little. is is imagery, of course, since no physical temple is </p>
<p>to be expected in the Eschaton; indeed it is explicitly denied in 21:22. </p>
<p>Moreover, what the NIV renders as never again will they leave it, says </p>
<p>27. is at least is how v. 10 has been traditionally—and rightly—understood. </p>
<p>For reasons that seem clear enough, but which are questionable in terms of John’s </p>
<p>own structures, the original NIV chose to make this nal imperative begin the next </p>
<p>paragraph. But that structural arrangement seems to stand against everything else in </p>
<p>the letter itself, not to mention the common structural realities of all the other letters. </p>
<p>Beginning with v. 8, and carrying through v. 11, everything is in the second-person </p>
<p>singular (thus speaking to the church collectively). Only at v. 12 does the grammar </p>
<p>change to the third person.</p>
<p>28. is is one of the only places in the NT where the anticipated coming of Christ </p>
<p>is expressed with the unambiguous adverb “soon.” In almost all other cases, even </p>
<p>though “soon” would have been a natural part of the expectation, this adverb is not </p>
<p>used. Nonetheless there is a sense in which “soon” is always a kind of “at the door” </p>
<p>adverb, and therefore is a tting way for every generation to reect on Christ’s return.</p>
<p>29. For further elaboration of this point, see my NICNT commentary on 1 ess in </p>
<p>e First and Second Letters to the essalonians (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2009) 109 </p>
<p>(re: “the crown in which we will glory”).</p>
