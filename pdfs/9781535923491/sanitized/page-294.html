<p>Revelation 19:11–21</p>
<p>272</p>
<p>ways these echoes are a stroke of genius in their own right, since only </p>
<p>here in the entire narrative is there scarcely any echo of John’s Bible, our </p>
<p>Old Testament. Rather, he now draws together threads from what has </p>
<p>preceded in his own narrative and presents them in the lone narrative </p>
<p>where the Lamb of God looks much more like the “Lion of the tribe of </p>
<p>Judah” (both of which images appear together in the rst presentation </p>
<p>of Christ in 5:5 and 6).</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white </p>
<p>horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice he </p>
<p>judges and makes war. </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>His eyes are like blazing re, and on his </p>
<p>head are many crowns. He has a name written on him that no one </p>
<p>knows but he himself. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, </p>
<p>and his name is the Word of God. </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>e armies of heaven were </p>
<p>following him, riding on white horses and dressed in ne linen, </p>
<p>white and clean. </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Coming out of his mouth is a sharp sword </p>
<p>with which to strike down the nations. “He will rule them with an </p>
<p>iron scepter.”</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of</p>
<p>God Almighty. </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>On his robe and on his thigh he has this name </p>
<p>written:</p>
<p>KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>And I saw an angel standing in the sun, who cried in a loud </p>
<p>voice to all the birds ying in midair, “Come, gather together for </p>
<p>the great supper of God, </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>so that you may eat the esh of kings, </p>
<p>generals, and the mighty, of horses and their riders, and the esh </p>
<p>of all people, free and slave, great and small.”</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>en I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their </p>
<p>armies gathered together to make war against the rider on the </p>
<p>horse and his army. </p>
<p>20</p>
<p>But the beast was captured, and with him </p>
<p>the false prophet who had performed the signs on his behalf. With </p>
<p>these signs he had deluded those who had received the mark of the </p>
<p>beast and worshiped his image. e two of them were thrown alive </p>
<p>into the ery lake of burning sulfur. </p>
<p>21</p>
<p>e rest were killed with the </p>
<p>sword coming out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all </p>
<p>the birds gorged themselves on their esh.</p>
<p>a white horse (6:2)</p>
<p>Faithful and True (1:5; 3:14)</p>
<p>eyes like blazing re (1:14)</p>
<p>3. Psalm 2:9</p>
