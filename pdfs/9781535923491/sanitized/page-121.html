<p>which is that there will be many more martyrdoms before the end itself. </p>
<p>is is expressed in terms of the full number of their fellow servants </p>
<p>and brothers and sisters who would be killed just as they had been.</p>
<p>e combination of “fellow servants and [siblings]” is especially </p>
<p>striking, not only because it is the only biblical occurrence of such a </p>
<p>combination but also because of their order of appearance. Almost cer-</p>
<p>tainly nothing should be made of the latter observation regarding their </p>
<p>order, since John here seems to be reminding his readers that they are </p>
<p>Christ’s “servants,” whatever else, and at the same time they are also sib-</p>
<p>lings of the same heavenly Father. e greater—and immediate—issue </p>
<p>lies with the nal clause saying many more are about to be killed just </p>
<p>as the earlier martyrs had been. eir signicance will be further high-</p>
<p>lighted in the vision of the heavenly multitude that follows in 7:9–17. </p>
<p>us even though John’s ultimate concern in this book is to reassure his </p>
<p>readers of their nal destiny, despite present and anticipated increased </p>
<p>suering, he neither downplays nor enhances the latter reality. ey </p>
<p>are, aer all, followers of the Crucied One, whose own death was at </p>
<p>the hands of the Empire, even though it had been instigated by the fear </p>
<p>and hatred of the very people he came to deliver.</p>
<p>e Sixth Seal: e Great Earthquake (6:12–17)</p>

<p>I watched as he opened the sixth seal. ere was a great earth-</p>
<p>quake. e sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the </p>
<p>whole moon turned blood red, </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>and the stars in the sky fell to </p>
<p>earth, as gs drop from a g tree when shaken by a strong wind. </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>e heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every </p>
<p>mountain and island was removed from its place.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>en the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the </p>
<p>rich, the mighty, and everyone else, both slave and free, hid in </p>
<p>caves and among the rocks of the mountains. </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>ey called to the </p>
<p>mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>from the face of</p>
<p>him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb! </p>
<p>17</p>
<p>For </p>
<p>the great day of their</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>wrath has come, and who can withstand</p>
<p>it?”</p>
<p>e sixth of the seven seals is in direct response to the question posed </p>
<p>by the martyrs in the h seal, “How long, Sovereign Lord, . . . until </p>
