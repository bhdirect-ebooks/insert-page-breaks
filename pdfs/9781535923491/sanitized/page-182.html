<p>those who have lived through both of these phenomena, there is a mo-</p>
<p>ment of fright in both cases; and well there is for many who have been </p>
<p>on the road during a severe hailstorm. In the present case these “acts </p>
of God” are narrated as a kind of divine response to the worship oered
<p>by the twenty-four elders, who have just announced that the anticipated </p>
<p>time of God’s judgment has in fact come.</p>
<p>With these words, then, John brings the rst half of his “revelation </p>
<p>of Christ” (1:1) to its tting conclusion. Even so, all that has preceded is </p>
<p>merely preparatory, setting the stage and oering the reasons for both </p>
<p>God’s judgment on the Empire and God’s salvation of his own people, </p>
<p>which will be described in greater detail in the visions that follow.</p>
