<p>Revelation 3:14–22</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>is also “the rstborn over all creation.” Paul’s clause almost certainly </p>
<p>means that his relationship to creation is that of “the rstborn,” and </p>
<p>thus he is the rightful heir of all creation, just as he was the actual cre-</p>
<p>ator at the beginning.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>e apparent reason for this appellation here</p>
<p>has to do with Laodicea’s location near one of the better-known natural </p>
<p>phenomena in the ancient world.</p>
<p>What follows the introduction of Christ in verse 14b is an extended </p>
<p>description (through v. 17) of Christ’s knowledge of their deeds, whose </p>
<p>primary feature is the considerable dierence between who they think </p>
<p>they are and who Christ knows they are, which Christ reveals to them </p>
<p>in this letter. is is a comeuppance of the highest order, a revelation </p>
<p>that comes in four distinguishable steps. First (v. 15), Christ reveals </p>
their actual condition from the divine perspective: you are neither
<p>cold nor hot, which is probably a reection on the fact that they are </p>
<p>across the river from the actual hot springs, so that by the time the hot </p>
<p>water reaches them across stream it has cooled enough to be insipid, </p>
<p>useful for neither medicinal nor drinking purposes. e more remark-</p>
<p>able moment of judgment comes next: Christ would rather have them </p>
<p>either one or the other! In actuality, of course, he would prefer them to </p>
<p>be “hot”; but if they were “cold” then they could more easily recognize </p>
<p>their situation and be helped. Rather, his judgment is that because you </p>
<p>are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of </p>
<p>my mouth. Besides revealing something about the ancients’ own view </p>
<p>of drinking water, a view with which most moderns can easily identify, </p>
<p>this sentence also reveals something about Christ’s own heart toward </p>
<p>his people. e imagery is especially striking, and is common to anyone </p>
<p>who has tried to get a drink of refreshing water from a public fountain, </p>
<p>but found it tepid and spit it out instantly.</p>
<p>With verse 17 the imagery changes from drinking water to the </p>
<p>plight of the wealthy, who by nature, of course, do not think of them-</p>
<p>selves as being in a quandary of any kind. e normal response of such </p>
<p>people is I am rich, which is then elaborated in terms of having ac-</p>
<p>quired wealth and therefore not needing a thing. But as is oen the </p>
<p>case, it is all a matter of perspective, in this instance theirs vis-à-vis </p>
<p>Christ’s. Viewed from below they have everything one could want or </p>
<p>need; viewed from above—and what they do not realize—they in fact </p>
