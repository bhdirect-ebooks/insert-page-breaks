<p>e Last Battle, Part 2: e Judgment and Elimination of Satan</p>
<p>285</p>
<p>thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the </p>
<p>false prophet had been thrown. ey will be tormented day and </p>
<p>night for ever and ever.</p>
<p>e next event in the series of concluding moments follows directly </p>
<p>from the preceding one. What is pictured here is a nal (but failed) at-</p>
<p>tempt by Satan to destroy God’s people who had not otherwise become </p>
<p>martyrs. In typical fashion the brief narrative comes in two parts: in </p>
<p>verses 7–9 Satan gathers the nations as an innumerable horde to sur-</p>
<p>round God’s people, who are further described as “the city [God] loves,” </p>
<p>imagery that will be elaborated in the nal scenes of the book; then in </p>
<p>verses 9–10 the nations are destroyed from heaven, and Satan himself </p>
<p>joins the beast and the false prophet in the lake of re.</p>
<p>In order to t this necessary moment into the overall narrative of </p>
<p>the book, John places this Final Battle as happening when the thousand </p>
<p>years are over; and with this clause all attempts to make things t into </p>
<p>an ordinary time frame seemed doomed from the start. What will have </p>
<p>made such a “millennium” possible was the binding of Satan for that pe-</p>
<p>riod; thus John narrates that at the end of it there will be a nal display </p>
<p>of intense evil unlike any before it, made possible because Satan will be </p>
<p>released from his prison in order to launch the Final Battle, which in </p>
<p>turn will lead to his own demise. All of this is portrayed with a rapid-</p>
<p>re narrative, which begins with Satan’s release and concludes with his </p>
<p>ultimate, necessary demise, so that the future God has prepared for his </p>
<p>own people may nally take place. Here seems to be a clear instance </p>
<p>where one must take John for his ultimate intent, and not try to make </p>
<p>his details “walk on all fours,” as it were.</p>
<p>us upon Satan’s “release from his prison,” he will go out to de-</p>
<p>ceive the nations in the four corners of the earth, language used in 7:1 </p>
<p>to represent the entire known world.” But the further identication of </p>
<p>these “four corners” as Gog and Magog presents something of a puzzle. </p>
<p>e language itself is taken from Ezekiel 38, where Magog is the chief </p>
<p>priest of Meshek, who will come with many nations (“a great horde, a </p>
<p>mighty army”) to punish Israel. Picking up on that prophesy, but now </p>
<p>with all the godless nations in view, Satan will gather them for battle; </p>
<p>and as with Ezekiel’s “great horde,” John prophesies that in number </p>
<p>they are like the sand on the seashore. Still using the past tense, he </p>
<p>notes next that they marched across the breadth of the earth and sur-</p>
