<p>Prelude to the (Original) Tale of Two Cities</p>
<p>201</p>
<p>force in chapters 15–20—with only momentary relief in 20:1–6 for the </p>
<p>sake of the martyrs. e (positive) tale of the second city, the heavenly </p>
<p>Jerusalem that comes down to earth the replace the rst one, is then </p>
<p>told in 21:1—22:5. Whether or not John intended the overall structure </p>
<p>in quite the way here suggested, it would seem to make especially good </p>
<p>sense to see the present two brief scenes of harvest as intentional antici-</p>
<p>patory pictures of the end of human history as we know it, rather than </p>
<p>treating them as two rather random pictures of harvest, with little or no </p>
<p>connection to the narrative as a whole.</p>
<p>In any case, since the second picture picks up an Old Testament </p>
<p>metaphor expressly depicting judgment, the problems lie altogether with </p>
<p>the rst one. And here the very lack of any hint of judgment—indeed, </p>
<p>who could possibly have read it negatively had it not been followed by </p>
<p>the second one?—would seem to indicate that the two metaphors to-</p>
<p>gether, and in chiastic fashion, anticipate what follows: rst (vv. 14–16), </p>
<p>the nal “gathering” of the people of God anticipates chapters 21–22; </p>
<p>second (vv. 17–20), the nal judgment of those who are not anticipates </p>
<p>chapters 17–20. Such a view, in fact, makes sense both of the reason for </p>
<p>there being two dierent pictures at all as well as of their content and </p>
<p>dierences.</p>
<p>e Grain Harvest (14:14–16)</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and seated on </p>
<p>the cloud was one like a son of man with a crown of gold on his </p>
<p>head and a sharp sickle in his hand. </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>en another angel came </p>
<p>out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was sitting </p>
<p>on the cloud, “Take your sickle and reap, because the time to reap </p>
<p>has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.” </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>So he who was </p>
<p>seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth </p>
<p>was harvested.</p>
<p>As noted above, and despite their apparent ease of understanding, with </p>
<p>these words John let loose in the church generations of debate regarding </p>
<p>some of its particulars as well as its overall intent: whether it pictures </p>
<p>the gathering of the righteous, or the “nal harvest” of the wicked as </p>
<p>they await the judgment pictured in the next scene. But this question </p>
<p>seems too easily resolved as to require much debate. Indeed, if one had </p>
<p>only this image and not the following one, there is hardly a reader in </p>
<p>history who would have, or even could have, read it as other than posi-</p>
