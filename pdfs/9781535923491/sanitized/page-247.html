<p>e Seven Bowls Are Poured Out</p>
<p>225</p>
<p>in all of Scripture. e very ambiguity of this term has thus called forth </p>
<p>considerable speculation, none of which seems immediately pertinent </p>
<p>to John’s own point, which is not the place as such, but the greater real-</p>
<p>ity intended by the imagery. e term itself, it should be noted, simply </p>
<p>means “Mount Megiddo,” but knowing that is of little help, and in many </p>
<p>ways seems very much beside the point since what follows is not the </p>
<p>Final Battle at all. When it does appear in 19:11–21, the place itself is </p>
<p>quite irrelevant. Most likely, therefore, and without any sense of cer-</p>
<p>tainty (!), this is a play on the Hebrew term har mô‘ed (the “mount of </p>
<p>assembly”), found in Isaiah 14:13, where the king of Babylon haughtily </p>
<p>sits enthroned, but will nally be brought low by Yahweh. If so, then </p>
<p>John is possibly using this term to indicate that the Empire will eventu-</p>
<p>ally be brought low at the Final Battle by the One who will “come like a </p>
<p>thief.” But certainty at this point simply lies beyond us.</p>
<p>e Seventh Bowl (16:17–21)</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>e seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and out </p>
<p>of the temple came a loud voice from the throne, saying, “It is </p>
<p>done!” </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>en there came ashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of </p>
<p>thunder and a severe earthquake. No earthquake like it has ever </p>
<p>occurred since the human race has been on earth, so tremendous </p>
<p>was the quake. </p>
<p>19</p>
<p>e great city split into three parts, and the cit-</p>
<p>ies of the nations collapsed. God remembered Babylon the Great </p>
<p>and gave her the cup lled with the wine of the fury of his wrath. </p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Every island ed away and the mountains could not be found. </p>
<p>21</p>
<p>From the sky huge hailstones of about a hundred pounds each </p>
<p>fell upon people. And they cursed God on account of the plague of </p>
<p>hail, because the plague was so terrible.</p>
<p>With the action of the seventh angel everything comes crashing down, </p>
<p>as it were. What is striking, and in clear contrast to the other angels, </p>
<p>is that this one poured out his bowl not on the land or the sun, but </p>
<p>simply into the air. Before the results themselves are given, however, </p>
<p>John notes rst that out of the temple came a loud voice, which in this </p>
<p>case came from the throne itself; thus apparently it is the voice of God. </p>
<p>e pronouncement is a dramatic one, expressed in the Greek perfect </p>
<p>(= already accomplished) tense, which in this case is nearly untranslat-</p>
<p>able, meaning something like “it has happened”; thus, It is done! By </p>
<p>this announcement John probably meant something like, “e end of </p>
