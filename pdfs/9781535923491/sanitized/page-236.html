<p>Revelation 15:1–8</p>
<p>214</p>
<p>Immediately aer the song, John says I looked, and what he now </p>
<p>saw is expressed in an especially awkward way, even for a language that </p>
<p>had considerable exibility in the way words may be ordered.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Here</p>
<p>the NIV translators have probably come as close as one can to John’s </p>
<p>intent, for whom, one must constantly keep in mind, Greek was a sec-</p>
<p>ond language. us what he most likely “saw” in heaven was the fact </p>
<p>that the temple/tabernacle containing the covenant law</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>was opened,</p>
<p>out of which now came the seven angels with the last seven plagues. </p>
<p>However, again typical of John’s narrative art, he rst describes the an-</p>
<p>gels themselves, rather than the content of what had been opened.</p>
<p>e narrative therefore returns to the seven angels noted in verse </p>
<p>1; and again with consummate skill, John makes sure that his readers </p>
<p>hear the plagues that follow—plagues on their enemies—in the context </p>
<p>of God’s unspeakable glory. us, and in keeping with their heavenly </p>
<p>origins, John describes the angels as dressed in clean, shining linen, </p>
<p>the cloth of both priest and tabernacle in the Old Testament; and in </p>
<p>keeping with the solemnity of the occasion, along with their linen they </p>
<p>also wore golden sashes around their chests, as did Christ himself in </p>
1:13. e divine mission of these seven angels, already hinted at in verse
<p>6 (“with the seven plagues,” unveiled next in ch. 16), was to pour out </p>
<p>on this planet seven golden bowls lled with the wrath of God, the </p>
<p>Eternal One, whose eternity is expressed with who lives for ever and </p>
<p>ever.</p>
<p>Finally, and with a marvelous touch of narrative art, John concludes </p>
<p>the introduction not with focus on what enters the temple in heaven, </p>
<p>but with what proceeds from it, namely the contents of “the seven bowls </p>
<p>of God’s wrath” that will be on display in chapter 16. us the present </p>
<p>introduction concludes with echoes of Isaiah 6:4 and 3: And the temple </p>
<p>was lled with smoke [6:4] from the glory of God [6:3] and from his </p>
<p>power, which at rst blush might seem like a most unusual description </p>
<p>of heaven. But again John is reecting the historic Jewish understanding </p>
<p>of the temple as the place of the Divine Presence. In so doing he once </p>
<p>5. In their Greek order—and grammar—the sentence reads: “And aer these things </p>
<p>I looked and opened [was] the naos [temple/tabernacle] of the tent of testimony in </p>
<p>heaven, and I saw . . .”. e two genitives “temple” and “tent,” therefore, are best seen as </p>
<p>in apposition, as the NIV has it, rather than as one modifying the other in some way.</p>
<p>6. For the probable origin of John’s language here, see Exod 38:21: “. . . the materials </p>
<p>used for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the covenant law.”</p>
