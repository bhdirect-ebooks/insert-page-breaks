<p>Revelation 22:1–5</p>
<p>304</p>
<p>Next up, and continuing with the theme of a restored Eden, John </p>
<p>sees on each side of the river the once forbidden, now fruit-bearing </p>
<p>tree of life, which in a restored Eden is made available to all. Next, and </p>
<p>still picturing a reversal of the rst Eden, John pictures the life-giving </p>
<p>nature of the tree. On the one hand, it is seen as bearing twelve crops </p>
<p>of fruit, yielding its fruit every month; thus “the food of eternity” is </p>
<p>fruit found above ground in trees, not vegetables growing in or out of </p>
<p>the ground. e tree that was therefore forbidden in the rst Eden is </p>
<p>now pictured as the source of nourishment in this renewed Eden. On </p>
<p>the other hand, and in keeping with what was known medically even </p>
<p>then, the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. What </p>
<p>extraordinary imagery is this—trees with fruit for eternal nourishment </p>
and whose leaves will continue to bring healing, not to individuals
<p>in this case, but to “the nations,” those entities that have historically </p>
<p>been at odds, and oen in warfare, with one another. Here imaged is </p>
<p>the original “United Nations,” made possible through the blood of the </p>
<p>Lamb, who now sits enthroned among those whom he has redeemed. </p>
<p>Surely this is the ultimate imagery of a restored Eden, whose original </p>
<p>curse was “enmity” between the man and the woman, and between the </p>
<p>two of them and the snake, enmity that became the unfortunate legacy </p>
<p>of humankind as the result of the fall. And this healing is made possible </p>
<p>precisely because no longer will there be any curse!</p>
<p>From his description of restored Eden, John turns next to the ul-</p>
<p>timate glory aorded redeemed humanity, the Divine Presence for all </p>
<p>eternity. us the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, </p>
<p>making it the one true “Eternal City,” in which context God’s servants </p>
<p>[probably meaning his “redeemed ones” rather than angels] will serve </p>
<p>him. Noticeably missing from this description of its eternal nature is </p>
<p>“serve him day and night”! Moreover, even though nothing more is said </p>
<p>in this regard, one should not imagine here something akin to people </p>
<p>serving a king as the king’s slaves. Whatever John himself understood </p>
<p>by “serve him,” he most likely was simply using language from his cur-</p>
<p>rent worldview, where royal servants live only to serve the king. Again </p>
<p>we are confronted with the kind of language that makes sense as imag-</p>
<p>ery, but which is nearly incomprehensible in terms of its getting eshed </p>
<p>out. At this point the reader is le with imagery alone, while one is </p>
<p>again thrown back on the fact that God can be trusted, whatever else; </p>
<p>and therefore one may be sure that this “heaven on earth” will be in-</p>
