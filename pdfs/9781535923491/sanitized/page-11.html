<p>Introduction</p>
<p>e purpose of this introduction is twofold: to introduce the reader </p>
<p>both to the Book of Revelation and to this commentary on the book. </p>
<p>We begin with the former. At issue is the fourfold question of what, </p>
<p>why, who, and when.</p>
<p>The Revelation: What Is It?</p>
<p>Readers of the New Testament experience something of a shock when </p>
<p>they come to the book of Revelation—at least once they get past the </p>
<p>rst ve chapters, which are quite manageable. Even the two scenes in </p>
<p>heaven in chapters 4 and 5—which may be a bit dierent, to be sure—</p>
<p>are still manageable. At chapter 6, however, with its four colored horses, </p>
<p>souls under the altar, and great earthquake, everything changes. At this </p>
<p>point most contemporary readers have a sense of being thrown into a </p>
<p>strange new world, and those who from a sense of duty keep on reading </p>
<p>to the end nd themselves in a constant struggle to stay with it. It is not </p>
<p>dicult to understand horses or beasts as such, but colored horses and </p>
<p>beasts with seven heads and ten horns do stretch the imagination—es-</p>
<p>pecially so for those who draw mental pictures as they read.</p>
<p>So the rst task for any reader of a book is to understand (or at </p>
<p>least anticipate) the kind of literary genre of the writing; and that is </p>
<p>where in this case everything tends to break down. People understand </p>
<p>what letters are, and how they function, and so have access to the New </p>
<p>Testament Epistles. For the most part they are also able to recognize the </p>
<p>style and poetry of the Old Testament Prophets—although with a de-</p>
<p>gree of diculty at times, to be sure. us the images themselves for the </p>
<p>most part lie within the worldview of the reader, and that because the </p>
<p>images are expressions of reality. But with Jewish apocalyptic writings </p>
<p>(Daniel 7–11 and much of Ezekiel) all of that changes, since many of the </p>
<p>images are intentionally bizarre and thus their meaning is uncertain.</p>
