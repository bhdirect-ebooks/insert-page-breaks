<p>Revelation 1:1–3</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>a future aspect to this “prophecy,” but it is primarily a word spoken into </p>
<p>the present situation of the seven churches; and its primary urgency is </p>
<p>not about the nal future event (recorded in chs. 20–22), but the near </p>
<p>future for John and his readers. What makes John a truly Christian </p>
<p>prophet is that from his position at the end of the rst Christian century </p>
<p>he clearly recognizes that the church and state are on a deadly collision </p>
<p>course, wherein the church will suer in the near future, but will know </p>
<p>Christ’s triumph at the end (the “real” future). us at the outset John </p>
<p>uses apocalyptic language that is intended to merge what is seen with </p>
<p>what is spoken. at is, for him this was a “seen” word; but to commu-</p>
<p>nicate it to the church it had to become a written word, “the testimony” </p>
<p>that Jesus Christ gave by way of one vision following another.</p>
<p>e concluding benediction is on both the one who reads aloud </p>
<p>[in a culture where only about 15 percent of the people could read or </p>
<p>write] the words of this prophecy and on those who hear and keep </p>
<p>what is written in it—John’s version of being both “hearers and doers </p>
<p>of the Word.” is reading/hearing phenomenon is made urgent by the </p>
<p>nal clause, because the time is near, which has created a dierent kind </p>
<p>of urgency for later readers. But what John almost certainly intended is </p>
<p>that the pending diculties that the recipients of this Revelation were </p>
<p>about to experience already stood at the door for them—as the unfold-</p>
<p>ing of subsequent second- and third-century history actually bore out.</p>
<p>The Johannine Prescript (1:4–8)</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>John,</p>
<p>To the seven churches in the province of Asia:</p>
<p>Grace and peace to you from him who is, and who was, and </p>
<p>who is to come, and from the seven spirits</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>before his throne,</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>and </p>
<p>from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the rstborn from </p>
<p>the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.</p>
<p>To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood, </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God </p>
<p>and Father—to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen.</p>
