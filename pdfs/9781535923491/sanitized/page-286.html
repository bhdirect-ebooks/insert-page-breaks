<p>Revelation 18:1—19:10</p>
<p>264</p>
<p>two basic groups pictured in heaven in chapters 4–5: the twenty-four </p>
<p>elders (4:4) and the four living creatures (4:6b). us the “woes” of la-</p>
<p>ment over Babylon’s fall, coming from the three groups most aected </p>
<p>by it (18:9–20), are now followed by a set of three “hallelujahs” by the </p>
<p>heavenly multitude, which celebrate in turn God’s justice, the eternal </p>
nature of that justice, and the divine vindication of God’s people.
<p>us John begins with a series of I heards, which by the very nature </p>
<p>of things situate John in heaven once again, even though he no longer </p>
<p>positions himself either on earth or in heaven. Again in typical fashion </p>
<p>the rst thing up is what sounded like the roar of a great multitude in </p>
<p>heaven, who were shouting: “Hallelujah!” is rst “hallelujah” begins </p>
<p>with praise for three realities that belong to our God, namely, salva-</p>
<p>tion, which manifests God’s glory and is carried out by God’s power. </p>
<p>In so doing John thus picks up the moments of praise in 7:10, 12 and </p>
<p>12:10. And even though it is easy for the reader to read quickly past this </p>
<p>series so as to get to the reasons for it, one should pause long enough </p>
<p>to recognize that this is not a random series, but one that precisely ts </p>
the present context. At issue for John and his readers is divine justice,
<p>related to the fact that a thoroughly ungodly earthly power currently </p>
<p>has the kind of ascendancy that seems both impenetrable and eternal; </p>
<p>aer all, in time Rome came to be known as “the Eternal City.” So what </p>
<p>is at stake for followers of the Slain Lamb is whether or not the God they </p>
<p>serve is true and just in his judgments, since present realities for them </p>
<p>would seem to suggest otherwise.</p>
e reality of divine justice on their behalf, again in a way similar
<p>to that of Israel’s prophetic tradition, is therefore expressed in the past </p>
tense, as a reality already accomplished from the divine perspective.
<p>us what John’s beleaguered churches need to hear is that “our God” </p>
<p>has condemned the great prostitute; that God thus intends to mete </p>
<p>out justice on an empire that cares nothing for God and will express its </p>
contempt by slaughtering God’s own people. e divine sentence lead-
<p>ing to Rome’s demise is that “the great prostitute” has corrupted the </p>
<p>earth by her adulteries, language that simultaneously echoes the im-</p>
<p>agery of chapter 17 and God’s earlier judgments on Judah in Jeremiah </p>
<p>13:15–27, especially verses 26–27.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>But the nal word goes beyond</p>
<p>22. Which read in part, “I will pull up your skirts over your face/that your </p>
<p>shame many be seen— / your adulteries and lustful neighings, / your shameful </p>
<p>prostitution!”</p>
