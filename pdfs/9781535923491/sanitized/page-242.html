<p>Revelation 16:1–21</p>
<p>220</p>
<p>John’s nal word in all this is as they deserve—“blood for blood”—</p>
a typically biblical way of appealing to divine justice. is pronounce-
<p>ment by the “angel in charge of the waters” is at the same time both </p>
<p>reassuring “the saints” that they have not been forgotten and indicating </p>
that those responsible for shedding their blood will experience divine
<p>retribution, spelled out here as having been given . . . blood to drink. </p>
So important for John is this moment of divine justice that the altar
<p>itself now responds, in this case with language that rst appeared in </p>
<p>the introduction (1:8) and then again in the rst scene in heaven (4:8) </p>
<p>as the initial language of praise by the four living creatures, who we are </p>
<p>told “never stop saying, ‘Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who </p>
<p>was, and is, and is to come.’” Here it is simply, Yes, Lord God Almighty, </p>
<p>to which is added language from the Psalter, true and just are your </p>
<p>judgments (cf. Ps 119:137). And one should probably not read past this </p>
<p>well-known biblical language too quickly, since “truth” and “justice” go </p>
<p>hand in hand, and the eternal God cannot be or do otherwise—which </p>
<p>is the reason for the “blood for blood” judgment that these two bowls </p>
<p>represent.</p>
<p>John now follows this brief reassuring interlude with the fourth </p>
<p>angel, who poured out his bowl on the sun. As noted earlier, the heav-</p>
<p>enly body that is recognized by all ancients as the most important of all, </p>
<p>and which was darkened with the blowing of the fourth trumpet, now </p>
<p>plays a reverse role, that of a blazing hot desert sun that was allowed to </p>
<p>scorch people with re. Its severe nature is further emphasized in that </p>
<p>they were seared by the intense heat, so that whether intended so by </p>
<p>John or not, they were given a foretaste of “the lake of burning sulfur” </p>
<p>that awaits Satan and his followers (20:10). Indeed, rather than seeing </p>
<p>the hand of God in all this as a call to repentance, they rather cursed the </p>
<p>name of God, whom they instinctively recognize as the One who had </p>
<p>control over these plagues, in the sense that they originate with God. </p>
Nonetheless, this recognition of the divine origin of these plagues leads
<p>not to repentance; rather they refused to repent and glorify God. At </p>
<p>this point John is arming a common reality: that even though people </p>
<p>wish to live totally apart from God, nonetheless when things go against </p>
<p>them God is to blame, who is thus to be cursed rather than loved (be-</p>
<p>cause loved by); and this leads the reader to the next picture.</p>
