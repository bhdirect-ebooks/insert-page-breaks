<p>Revelation 5:5–6</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>For what John sees is not a lion at all, but a Lamb, looking as if it had </p>
<p>been slain, so that the only lion in heaven is in fact the Slain Lamb.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>It</p>
<p>is dicult to emphasize adequately the theological import of this dra-</p>
<p>matic replacement of images, in terms of both Johannine Christology </p>
<p>and soteriology (his understanding of the person of Christ and of his </p>
<p>saving work). In a book like the Revelation, which ultimately is inter-</p>
<p>ested above all in God’s justice,</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>no lion ever appears in heaven. But the</p>
<p>Lamb is there all the way through, even at the end (“the throne of God </p>
<p>and of the Lamb will be in the city,” 22:3).</p>
<p>With this language John uses imagery that also appears in his </p>
<p>Gospel, where John the Baptist presents Jesus as “the Lamb of God, who </p>
<p>takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29; cf. v. 36). is profound </p>
<p>representation has its roots in the most signicant—and for the early </p>
<p>Christians, the most frequently cited—of the messianic prophecies of </p>
<p>the Old Testament, Isaiah 52:13—53:12.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Equally signicant, however,</p>
<p>is the Lamb’s position in the heavenly scene. He is noted as standing </p>
<p>in the center, thus taking his rightful place before the throne along </p>
<p>with “the sevenfold Spirit,” who hereaer, and rightly, appears only on </p>
<p>earth. And because he is now not only “standing in the center,” but has </p>
<p>himself become the center of everything, the Lamb is also described as </p>
<p>encircled by the four living creatures and the elders. us, even in </p>
<p>this vision with its rich imagery, John is careful to place Father and Son </p>
<p>together on and before the throne.</p>
<p>In John’s theology, one must point out, Christ triumphs through </p>
<p>both his death and resurrection. us in the Gospel, with a marvel-</p>
<p>ous play on words that can happen in Greek in ways less available in </p>
<p>English, Christ’s saving work rests on the historical reality of his being </p>
<p>“lied up” (John 3:14–15; 12:32), a word that also carries the sense of </p>
<p>being “exalted.” us this nicely ambiguous word regularly serves as </p>
<p>a double referent for John: Christ has been “lied up” from the earth </p>
<p>onto the cross, whereby he secured salvation for all who put their trust </p>
<p>15. is imagery also has its OT roots, this time in Isa 53:7: “he was led like a lamb </p>
<p>to the slaughter.”</p>
<p>16. Indeed, God’s righteous judgments are on display throughout, which are </p>
<p>brought to dramatic expression nally by means of the One seated on the white horse </p>
<p>(19:11.).</p>
<p>17. In this case, v. 7: “He was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before </p>
<p>its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.”</p>
