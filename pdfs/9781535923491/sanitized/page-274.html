<p>their own. ey are the Herod’s and Philip’s of the earth, who strut with </p>
<p>enormous self-importance, but who ultimately lick the boots of the em-</p>
<p>peror. Nonetheless, Rome the harlot was also dependent on them, thus </p>
<p>they are pictured as having committed adultery with her and shared </p>
<p>her luxury. But in the end they were actually nobodies; thus when they </p>
<p>see the smoke of her burning, they will weep and mourn over her. </p>
<p>John’s focus, of course, is altogether on Rome; but he also recognizes </p>
<p>what her downfall will mean to these underlings. eir time is over </p>
<p>when Rome’s is over; hence they are terried at her torment, as well </p>
<p>they might be.</p>
<p>ese petty kings, therefore, are the rst to be presented as crying </p>
<p>out the same lament, Woe! Woe to you, great city, whose “greatness” </p>
<p>is then elaborated in terms of her power: You mighty city of Babylon! </p>
<p>In the following two woes the “great city” is further specied in ways </p>
<p>that are related to the speakers themselves, thus indicating that the real </p>
<p>reasons for mourning had to do with their own losses, not with Rome </p>
<p>as such. In this rst instance the loss is expressed simply in terms of the </p>
<p>suddenness of the harlot’s demise: In one hour your doom has come! </p>
<p>Even so, for doom to come to Rome will mean that countless others, </p>
<p>mostly sycophants, will also experience great loss. us it is the very </p>
<p>brevity, and lack of further elaboration, that makes this initial expres-</p>
<p>sion of woe poignant.</p>
<p>e Second Woe: e Merchants of the Earth (18:11–17a)</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>‘e merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her be-</p>
<p>cause no one buys their cargoes any more—</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>cargoes of gold, silver, </p>
<p>precious stones and pearls; ne linen, purple, silk and scarlet cloth; </p>
<p>every sort of citron wood, and articles of every kind made of ivory, </p>
<p>costly wood, bronze, iron and marble; </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>cargoes of cinnamon and </p>
<p>spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, of wine and olive oil, of </p>
<p>ne our and wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and carriages; and </p>
<p>the bodies and souls of human beings sold as slaves.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>“ey will say, ‘e fruit you longed for is gone from you. All </p>
<p>your luxury and splendor have vanished, never to be recovered.’ </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>e merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth </p>
<p>from her will stand far o, terried at her torment. ey will weep </p>
<p>and mourn </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>and cry out:</p>
