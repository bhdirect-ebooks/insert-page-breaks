<p>e First Four Trumpets and the First Eagle</p>

<p>who are “sealed” by God escape these woes, just as the children of Israel </p>
<p>escaped the plagues. e Exodus plagues themselves included the fol-</p>
<p>lowing (those that are underlined are echoed in the present account):</p>
<p>1. Waters to blood</p>
<p>2. Frogs</p>
<p>3. Gnats</p>
<p>4. Flies</p>
<p>5. Death of the livestock</p>
<p>6. Boils</p>
<p>7. Hail</p>
<p>8. Locusts</p>
<p>9. Darkness</p>
<p>10. Death of the rstborn</p>
<p>John’s own vision clearly echoes the four plagues underlined above, two </p>
<p>of which (7 and 9) come to earth from above, as do three of John’s.</p>
<p>One should note that all four of the present plagues have the same </p>
<p>pattern: (a) the angel blows the trumpet, (b) the plague is described, </p>
<p>and (c) the results are measured, all in terms of one-third destruction. </p>
<p>is latter feature is especially important, since it is John’s way of in-</p>
<p>dicating that the present plagues are merely anticipatory, announcing </p>
<p>ahead of time that the present persecutors of God’s people, just as with </p>
the Egyptians of old, will eventually be visited with divine judgments
<p>for their role in the persecutions.</p>
<p>John begins the present narrative with another introductory sen-</p>
<p>tence, en the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to </p>
<p>sound them, thus following up the introduction of the angels in verse 2. </p>
<p>What occurs next is the rst of four immediate, but partial judgments </p>
<p>directed at the Empire. e judgment itself is aimed at the land, picking </p>
<p>up the rst of the judgments of the four angels in 7:1, who were told </p>
<p>not to “harm the land or the sea or the trees.” Now all heaven opens up, </p>
<p>as it were, so that there came hail and re mixed with blood, and it </p>
<p>was hurled down to the earth. is is a description of a great electrical </p>
<p>storm, in which both hail and lightning (“re”) strike the earth. e </p>
<p>apocalyptic dimension of the scene is found in the description of the </p>
<p>lightning as “re mixed with blood.” As with all of these scenes, the </p>
present destruction is expressed in the passive voice so that its divine
