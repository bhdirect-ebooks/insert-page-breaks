<p>e Defeat of the Dragon in Heaven</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>among the (usually) seven highest-ranking angels, called “archangels.”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e name itself apparently derived from three passages in Daniel (10:13, </p>
<p>21; 12:1) where a mysterious gure so-named is the keeper of the heav-</p>
<p>enly books. It seems altogether likely that by the time John wrote his </p>
<p>Revelation this name had become a xture on the biblical landscape; </p>
<p>and in John’s case Michael is clearly the leader of the “heavenly host” </p>
<p>who engage in the Holy War on God’s behalf. Our present diculty </p>
<p>with the text has to do with timing. John’s own point, of course, is to use </p>
<p>this piece of lore to picture the defeat of Satan not at some prehistoric </p>
<p>point, but at the point of his ultimate defeat through the cross and res-</p>
<p>urrection, as is made clear in verses 10–11. What John appears to have </p>
<p>done is let the prehistoric and historic moments merge in the telling of </p>
<p>the story here.</p>
<p>What immediately follows, therefore, on the one hand seems to be </p>
<p>prehistoric altogether. us the narrative continues by noting that in </p>
<p>the war in heaven the dragon was not strong enough, resulting in his </p>
<p>defeat, so that “the dragon and his angels” lost their place in heaven. </p>
<p>On the other hand, since John goes on to describe this moment in terms </p>
<p>of its eect on the earth, and even though Eden is not mentioned, the </p>
<p>result appears to be an apocalyptic description of the events of Genesis </p>
<p>3, intended to encourage his readers in the midst of their own present </p>
<p>(and soon-to-be-increased) diculties. erefore, in the prehistoric </p>
<p>moment being described, the great dragon was hurled down, which </p>
<p>in John’s very complex sentence eventually results in his being hurled </p>
<p>to the earth, and his angels with him. But before John gets to this nal </p>
<p>result, he interrupts his narrative to make sure his readers understand </p>
<p>clearly who the dragon is by reminding them of most of the names by </p>
<p>which he had been known: that ancient serpent called the devil, or </p>
<p>Satan,</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> who leads the whole earth astray.</p>
<p>is understanding of the devil picks up on the ancient Jewish </p>
<p>tradition that viewed Satan as a fallen member of the heavenly court, </p>
<p>which ultimately derives from Old Testament prophetic oracles against </p>
<p>7. Michael appears elsewhere in the NT in Jude 9; according to 1 En. 9:1 and 23:4–8, </p>
<p>the others have the names Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Raguel, Zerachiel and Remiel.</p>
<p>8. For this as a common title for the devil, see n. 9 on p. 31, where the “name” rst </p>
<p>occurs. Later names such as Lucifer, of course, were not available to John.</p>
