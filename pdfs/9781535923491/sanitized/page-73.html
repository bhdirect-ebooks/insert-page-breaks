<p>ful can make, the emperor required grape growing empire-wide to be </p>
<p>reduced in half—most likely, it is thought by historians, as a way to </p>
<p>force the growing of corn for his armies. is rather foolish law had </p>
<p>particularly devastating eect on places like Philadelphia, which were </p>
<p>largely dependent on vineyards for their livelihood. It appears to have </p>
<p>fostered a strong sense of betrayal among the people, who had always </p>
<p>been very pro-emperor. In a variety of ways much of this history makes </p>
<p>sense of some of the data in our letter.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>e ascription about Christ in verse 7 is the rst in the series </p>
<p>that is not basically a reection of the vision in 1:16–18; yet even here </p>
<p>John’s creativity is at work, for the key word is “key,” which appeared </p>
<p>in 1:19, where Christ holds “the keys of death and Hades.” But before </p>
<p>that we are given a description of Christ that is especially signicant. </p>
<p>What the NIV has chosen to render as adjectives with who is holy and </p>
<p>true, are rather titular, since the adjectives in both cases are preceded </p>
<p>by the denite article (“the”). us Christ is here designated as “the </p>
<p>Holy One” and “the True One.” e signicance of these referents is </p>
<p>that, in the rst case, it reects Old Testament language about God, </p>
<p>who is frequently designated as “the Holy One” (see e.g., Isaiah 40:25; </p>
<p>Habakkuk 3:3). Later, in Revelation 6:10, this is the very language used </p>
<p>of God the Father—“the Holy and True One”—while in 19:11 Christ is </p>
<p>called “Faithful and True.” All of this again reects John’s assumed high </p>
<p>Christology, where titles elsewhere used for God the Father are without </p>
<p>note or argumentation used for the Son.</p>
<p>e second descriptor of Christ is that he holds the key of David, </p>
<p>which is then claried to mean that what he opens no one can shut, </p>
<p>and what he shuts no one can open. is language is taken directly </p>
<p>from Isaiah 22:22, in an oracle of judgment against Shebna, the “keeper </p>
<p>of the keys” (= the steward in charge of the royal palace), that another </p>
<p>would take his place. In John’s imagery, this royal privilege belongs not </p>
<p>to the king’s steward, but to the King himself; and it is said in anticipa-</p>
<p>tion of the promise in verse 8 that follows. All of this is again in keeping </p>
<p>with the high Christology noted above. It is of further interest that in </p>
<p>both Isaiah and the Revelation the rst task of the keeper of the keys is </p>
<p>to open what is shut, not to lock what has previously been open.</p>
<p>23. is letter and the next are also the second in length to yatira of the 7 letters </p>
