<p>Revelation 11:1–14</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>ordered to exclude the outer court . . . because it has been given to </p>
<p>the Gentiles, who in turn will trample on the holy city for 42 months. </p>
<p>e content of this command is a clear echo of Ezekiel 40–42, where </p>
<p>the measuring itself points to the greatness and grandeur of the nal, </p>
<p>eschatological temple of God, which will replace the one destroyed by </p>
<p>Babylon. Very likely John had the larger context of Ezekiel in view as </p>
<p>well.</p>
<p>For Ezekiel the destruction of Solomon’s temple was necessary </p>
<p>because it had been desecrated by God’s own people. is comes out </p>
<p>most clearly in Ezekiel 8:5–18, where the idolatry of the temple courts </p>
<p>is described, followed in turn (ch. 9) by the execution of the idola-</p>
<p>tors and (in ch. 10) the glory departing from the temple. At the end </p>
<p>of things, aer Israel is “resurrected” by the Spirit (ch. 37), Ezekiel is </p>
<p>given a picture of a great eschatological temple (chs. 40–43). John is </p>
<p>now drawing from that vision, while at the same time looking forward </p>
<p>to its nal fulllment (21:15–27), where the New Jerusalem exists </p>
<p>without a temple. us, since “measuring” is not known elsewhere as </p>
<p>a symbol for “sealing,” in this present imagery John is to call attention </p>
<p>to the people of God as God’s own eschatological dwelling place, and </p>
<p>he is to do so by measuring the temple. In real life the outer court was </p>
<p>called “the court of the Gentiles,” thus in this measuring John is told to </p>
<p>exclude that court. Most likely “the Gentiles” in this case refers to the </p>
<p>Roman Empire, which will play havoc with God’s people, but only for a </p>
<p>limited time, and which in any case is being excluded altogether from </p>
<p>the Divine Presence.</p>
<p>Of greater diculty for the contemporary reader is how the next </p>
<p>two items, the altar and the worshipers, t into the overall scene. At </p>
<p>issue are two matters: rst is the location of the altar, which belongs to </p>
<p>the inner court of the temple; second is whether the measuring of the </p>
<p>altar is a positive or negative symbol. at in turns leads to whether the </p>
<p>“worshipers” are genuine believers or are syncretists of the kind who </p>
<p>were to be cast out in Ezekiel’s vision. What might be signicant is that </p>
<p>verse 1 has no less than ve verbal echoes to the Septuagint of Ezekiel </p>
<p>8:16, where the syncretists are doomed to be banished forever. But since </p>
<p>Aer all, John has placed himself in exile on Patmos (1:9), which is one of the few in-</p>
<p>stances where nothing apocalyptic or gurative is intended. us when he “was given </p>
<p>a reed like a measuring rod” and told to “go and measure the temple of God,” this can </p>
<p>only be the imagery of apocalyptic, not something to be envisioned as literal.</p>
