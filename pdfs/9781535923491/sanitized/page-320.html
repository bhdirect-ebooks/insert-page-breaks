<p>Revelation 21:9–27</p>
<p>298</p>
<p>and found it to be 12,000 stadia</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>in length, and as wide and high</p>
<p>as it is long. </p>
<p>17</p>
<p>He measured its wall and it was 144 cubits</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> thick,</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> </p>
<p>by human measurement, which the angel was using. </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>e wall </p>
<p>was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass. </p>
<p>19</p>
<p>e foundations of the city walls were decorated with every </p>
<p>kind of precious stone. e rst foundation was jasper, the second </p>
<p>sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, </p>
<p>20</p>
<p>the h onyx, </p>
<p>the sixth ruby, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth </p>
<p>topaz, the tenth turquoise, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelh </p>
<p>amethyst.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> </p>
<p>21</p>
<p>e twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made </p>
<p>of a single pearl. e great street of the city was of gold, as pure as </p>
<p>transparent glass.</p>
<p>Again taking his cue from Ezekiel 40, John now follows his descrip-</p>
<p>tion of the “new Jerusalem” with its measurements. e measurements </p>
<p>themselves conclude with the wall (v. 17), while the rest of the descrip-</p>
<p>tion names the precious stones that make up, rst the wall, and then its </p>
<p>foundations and its gates.</p>
<p>As part of the drama, therefore, it is the angel himself, the one </p>
<p>who talked with John, who thus had a measuring rod of gold (what </p>
<p>else?) with which to measure the city, including also in this case both </p>
<p>its gates and its walls. And for the present reader who might easily get </p>
<p>lost in the measurements that follow, it needs to be pointed out at the </p>
<p>beginning that the “new Jerusalem” itself is a perfect cube, as high as it </p>
<p>is wide and long, nearly 1400 miles</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> in all three dimensions. Here es-</p>
<p>pecially one needs to abandon the kind of literalism that so many tend </p>
<p>to bring to this text and to hear it for what John himself intends. Aer </p>
<p>all, this is simply the “holy of holies,” itself a perfect cube, multiplied </p>
<p>beyond the capacity of one’s imagination. John’s own point, therefore, </p>
<p>seems especially clear, since the “holy of holies” was for Israel the sin-</p>
<p>gular place of God’s own presence on planet earth, a place so holy that it </p>
<p>8. at is, about 1,400 miles (about 2,200 kilometers).</p>
<p>9. at is, about 200 feet (about 65 meters).</p>
<p>10. Or high.</p>
<p>11. e precise identication of some of these precious stones is uncertain.</p>
<p>12. To give the reader an idea as to the immensity of what is here pictured, this </p>
<p>would stretch from my present home in Vancouver, BC, almost to San Diego in the </p>
<p>south and nearly to Winnipeg in the east; and from there one can draw a square down </p>
<p>to the Texas-Oklahoma border and back to California. And then, of course, its height </p>
<p>is equal to its length and breadth, far above the earth’s atmosphere.</p>
