<p>e Great Multitude in White Robes</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>1:5, noted above and found in the King James Version. Elsewhere in </p>
<p>Scripture blood is a metaphor for death, meaning death by means of </p>
<p>the blood being poured out. us, as noted above on 5:9, the metaphor </p>
<p>“purchased with his blood” means that people were purchased for God </p>
<p>at the cost of the life of the Son.</p>
<p>Most likely, therefore, the language “made white in the blood of </p>
<p>the Lamb,” has double entendre. Language from the Old Testament sac-</p>
<p>ricial system, used here to signify Christ’s death and understood as the </p>
<p>means of our being “purchased” for God, becomes in this book the ulti-</p>
<p>mate symbol for victory through death. at is, it is the way of triumph </p>
<p>for the martyrs, who, as Christ, will be raised to eternal glory. us, in </p>
<p>context, the imagery almost certainly has as its rst reference that these </p>
<p>are the redeemed who have been “sealed” by God, and who, second, </p>
<p>have also come to their nal rest (and glory) through great suering.</p>
<p>e present passage then concludes (vv. 15–17) with a description </p>
<p>of the martyrs’ nal eschatological rest, which of course is described </p>
<p>especially for the sake of those among John’s readers who are yet to </p>
<p>be martyred, At the same time, it oers comfort to all who belong to </p>
<p>Christ. John begins with a strong therefore, referring back to the im-</p>
<p>mediately preceding verse 14. What follows is one of the more remark-</p>
<p>able Scriptural images of the nal glory of all believers, even though </p>
<p>it is intended in its entirety to bring comfort to believers in the seven </p>
<p>churches (and beyond) who are about to undergo intense persecution </p>
<p>that will lead to many martyrdoms. eir ultimate end is to stand be-</p>
<p>fore the throne of God and serve him in his temple. Although this </p>
<p>latter term (“temple”) has not been used heretofore to describe heaven, </p>
<p>everything else in the preceding visions in chapters 4–6 has had such </p>
<p>a referent as its presupposition. is understanding is later spelled out </p>
<p>in detail in 21:22–26, where the heavenly city itself becomes the nal, </p>
<p>ultimate temple of God.</p>
<p>With yet another play on terms and ideas, what the NIV has </p>
<p>rendered as shelter them with his presence (lit. “spread his tent over </p>
<p>them”) is imagery assuring rest for God’s people. us the “tent” of the </p>
<p>Old Testament now serves in the heavenly “temple” as the means of </p>
<p>oering them eternal blessing and security. And the one who will do </p>
<p>this is he who sits on the throne, so that with the imagery of “throne” </p>
and “tent” God is envisioned as both the ultimate divine ruler and the ultimate divine protector. Since the imagery of the spread out “tent” is
