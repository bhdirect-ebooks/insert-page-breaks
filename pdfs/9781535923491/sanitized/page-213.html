<p>Two Interlude Visions</p>
<p>191</p>
<p>does not here say “the 144,000,” he probably intends the reader to un-</p>
<p>derstand this as the same group, thus using this symbolic number to re-</p>
<p>fer to the martyrs. is seems further supported by their being already </p>
<p>present in heaven. Second, and more importantly, they stand in obvious </p>
<p>contrast to those who in the preceding chapter have the “mark of the </p>
<p>beast” on their foreheads; and as before, this is the mark of ownership. </p>
<p>ird, and again in deliberate contrast to what has preceded, what is </p>
<p>written on their foreheads is not just a mark designating “belonging to </p>
<p>. . .”; rather, they bear the actual names of both the Lamb and the Father </p>
<p>on their foreheads. is is belonging of the ultimate kind.</p>
<p>In typical fashion, aer “seeing” comes the phrase and I heard. e </p>
<p>sound is then said to have come from heaven, which ordinarily would </p>
<p>make one think that John was on earth; but the rest of the scene takes </p>
<p>place only in heaven, thus indicating that this is where John continues </p>
<p>to see what unfolds. When John goes on to describe what he heard, one </p>
<p>has a sense of mixed signals, since the rst element in the description is </p>
<p>clamorous, picking up loud noises from nature, both earth and heaven. </p>
<p>us the sound is likened to the roar of rushing waters and like a loud </p>
<p>peal of thunder. e rest of the narrative indicates that these are sim-</p>
<p>ply preludes, attention-getting devices as it were, to what John further </p>
<p>heard and saw. “Prelude” seems to be the right term here since what </p>
<p>follows is the music of heaven, played on harps and sung by the martyrs </p>
<p>themselves. us John rst describes the sound I heard as like that of </p>
<p>harpists playing on their harps—the swell of many musicians playing </p>
<p>on their many-stringed instruments at once.</p>
<p>Even more signicantly, the stringed musicians were accompany-</p>
<p>ing the ultimate choir, the martyrs, now pictured as heavenly singers </p>
<p>on whose foreheads were written the names of both the Father and </p>
<p>the Lamb. Appropriate to their role and setting, John says they sang a </p>
<p>new song in the presence of the entire primary heavenly personages, </p>
<p>thus before the throne [in this case of both Father and Son, chs. 4–5] </p>
<p>and before the four living creatures and the elders (also chs. 4–5). </p>
<p>At this point the modern (especially Western) reader must give up the </p>
<p>penchant for literalism, and (especially) chronological sequencing, and </p>
<p>hear the text on its own terms, and thus for the glory that belongs to </p>
it. is is not about time; this is about who. Here is the divine response
<p>through the prophet John to assure his readers that even though mar-</p>
<p>tyrdoms will come—and there will be many—the martyrs themselves </p>
