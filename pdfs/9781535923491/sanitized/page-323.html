<p>e New Jerusalem, the Bride of the Lamb</p>
<p>301</p>
<p>does here, but in a most remarkable way: by describing the reasons for </p>
<p>the temple at all, as the place of God’s “dwelling” on earth.</p>
<p>So John begins with the eye-catching armation that I did not see </p>
<p>a temple in the city. “What?” one might ask, “Jerusalem without a tem-</p>
<p>ple?” To which the answer is “yes,” because the reason for the temple in </p>
<p>the rst place has now come to earth. e Lord God Almighty [a des-</p>
<p>ignation reserved in this book for moments of special emphasis</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>] and </p>
<p>the Lamb [a designation for Christ that rst appears in the heavenly </p>
<p>scene in chapter 5] are its temple. Here is the certain evidence of the </p>
<p>point made earlier (on v. 3 above), that the basic reason for the temple </p>
<p>was not for the sacricial system, but to serve as the place of God’s pres-</p>
<p>ence with Israel in Jerusalem, just as he had been present with them in </p>
<p>the tabernacle in the wilderness.</p>
<p>But there is more. Not only is there no need of a temple, neither </p>
<p>is there need any longer for light from the heavenly bodies. us the </p>
<p>city does not need the sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of </p>
<p>God gives</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>it light, and the Lamb is its lamp, which at the same time</p>
<p>anticipates the nal description of future glory in 22:5. us all dark-</p>
<p>ness is banished forever; in the presence of God and the Lamb there is </p>
<p>only light. Not only so, but in fulllment of Isaiah 60:3, the nations will </p>
<p>walk by its light, thus fullling the promise that Israel will be a blessing </p>
<p>to the Gentiles. Also fullled is the promise in Isaiah 60:3, 5 that the </p>
<p>kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it,</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> John’s way of pic-</p>
<p>turing the repeated prophetic promise of the eschatological gathering </p>
<p>of the nations in its positive sense. at is, in contrast to the imagery in </p>
<p>20:8, John here pictures what remains of the nations as beneciaries of </p>
<p>God’s full restoration of his own people.</p>
<p>ese two themes (the nations walking in God’s light, and the </p>
<p>earth’s “kings” bringing their splendor into the city of God) are then </p>
<p>reiterated in slightly expanded ways. John rst makes the further obser-</p>
<p>14. See previously 11:17; 15:7; 16:7; and 19:6. all but the latter as vocatives in mo-</p>
<p>ments of praise or prayer. In 19:6 the designation is at the beginning of praise, but is </p>
<p>not a vocative.</p>
<p>15. In typical fashion John has expressed this in the aorist (past) tense; what is, is </p>
<p>what God has done.</p>
<p>16. e Isaiah texts read: “Nations will come to your light, and kings to the bright-</p>
<p>ness of your dawn”; and “the wealth of the seas will be brought to you, to you the riches </p>
<p>of the nations will come.”</p>
