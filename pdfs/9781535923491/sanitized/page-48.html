<p>Revelation 2:1–7</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>gospel over against some believers who have gotten o track vis-à-vis </p>
<p>its truth.</p>
<p>First up, then, is the fact that you cannot tolerate wicked people, </p>
<p>a clause that must be kept in context or else it can become a kind of club </p>
<p>that the “righteous” might use in contending with the “unrighteous.” </p>
<p>ese people’s wickedness has altogether to do with their claim to be </p>
<p>apostles but are not. At stake for John at this point in time is the truth </p>
<p>of the gospel over against those who would twist it into a “gospel” of </p>
<p>their own making. But at issue for later readers is the ambiguous word </p>
<p>“false,” as to whether it refers to the self-designated “apostles” or wheth-</p>
<p>er it refers to their teaching as such. Probably it is a bit of both; that </p>
<p>is, they are “false” apostles precisely because they are oering a “false” </p>
<p>gospel, and that is what makes them “wicked.” Nineteen centuries later </p>
<p>one can only speculate as to the nature of the falsehood they are putting </p>
<p>forward, but in light of John’s Gospel and his First Epistle we are prob-</p>
<p>ably to understand this false teaching as some kind of doceticism, with </p>
<p>its denial of the goodness of the material world in general, and of the </p>
<p>human body in particular. How such people had been tested and found </p>
<p>. . . false cannot be known with precision from this distance in time, </p>
<p>but the emphasis in both the Gospel and First Epistle on Christ’s having </p>
<p>come “in the esh” suggests that inherent to their “gospel” was a denial </p>
<p>of the genuine physical reality of Christ’s incarnation.</p>
<p>e nal clause in Christ’s opening commendation to this church </p>
<p>comes in the form of the three Greek words that the NIV translators </p>
<p>have rendered persevered / endured hardships / not grown weary. </p>
<p>is sounds very much like John is writing to a church under siege, and </p>
<p>while it is common for us at our distance to think of these believers as </p>
<p>very near the source, as it were, in fact they are most likely at least a full </p>
<p>generation, if not two, removed from the rst believers in this part of </p>
<p>the Roman Empire. at is, if these churches were founded in the 50s, </p>
<p>as seems most likely, their present membership would be composed of </p>
<p>only a few who were there from their beginnings. us it is not dicult </p>
<p>for persons in their seventies to hear these words in light of their many </p>
<p>years of service to our Lord, who have “stayed with the stu” as it were </p>
<p>and have “not grown weary,” even though there might have been every </p>
<p>good reason for them to have done so.</p>
<p>Given this kind of commendation, one is then not quite prepared </p>
<p>for the critique and call for repentance that follow, a critique that is easy </p>
