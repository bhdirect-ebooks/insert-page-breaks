<p>Revelation 5:7–13</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>as being “read” or even “looked at.” Rather, what evolves is a series of </p>
<p>pictures, not a text with emphasis on words that make up straightfor-</p>
<p>ward prose sentences. John is addressing the readers’ imaginations and </p>
<p>wants them to see by way of vivid imagery what God will let loose in the </p>
<p>future, both theirs and that of those who are harassing and/or torment-</p>
<p>ing them.</p>
<p>With a crescendo of praise, and in some contrast to the preceding </p>
<p>scene, the distinctively Christian thing now happens in heaven when </p>
<p>the Lamb “took the scroll.” In language very much in keeping with </p>
<p>what has preceded, and which is intended to inspire both wonder and </p>
<p>praise as well as comfort and hope, the whole heavenly entourage of the </p>
<p>previous scene now oers worship to the Lamb. But John sets this out </p>
<p>carefully, both in terms of who does the singing and of the content of </p>
<p>their songs.</p>
<p>us when the Lamb had taken the scroll, the rst beings to re-</p>
<p>spond are the two groups already in heaven: the four living creatures </p>
<p>and the twenty-four elders, who fell down before the Lamb. e </p>
<p>twenty-four elders are themselves further described in the language of </p>
<p>the Levite singers in Chronicles, in that each one had a harp. en, </p>
<p>echoing Psalm 141:2 (“may my prayer be set before you like incense”), </p>
<p>they are described as holding golden bowls full of incense, which are </p>
<p>the prayers of God’s people. ese nal words should not be treated as </p>
<p>a kind of throwaway clause; rather once more they remind John’s read-</p>
<p>ers that the prayers oered in light of their present suering are being </p>
<p>heard in heaven.</p>
<p>Following this heavenly obeisance to the Lamb, and now echoing </p>
<p>Psalm 98:1, these heavenly groups sang a new song</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>—new because it </p>
<p>is now addressed to the Lamb, and sung in praise of him. At the same </p>
<p>time the “new song” begins with a deliberate echo of the song that the </p>
<p>heavenly throng had just sung “to him who sits on the throne.” Just as </p>
<p>the eternal God is “worthy to receive glory,” so too the Lamb, who above </p>
<p>was noted as “able to open the scroll”, is now praised as the One worthy </p>
<p>to take the scroll and to open its seals. And just as God the Father was </p>
<p>acclaimed worthy “because [he] created all things,” so now the Lamb </p>
<p>is acclaimed as worthy because you were slain, a death that had the </p>
<p>23. us they are “obeying” what was expressed in the Psalm by way of imperative, </p>
<p>where God’s people are urged to “sing to the Lord a new song, for he has done marvel-</p>
<p>ous things” (98:1; cf. 96:1).</p>
