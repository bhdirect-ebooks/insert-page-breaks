<p>e Two Beasts</p>
<p>185</p>
<p>begins this section of his narrative with, then I saw a second beast, this </p>
<p>one coming out of the earth. In this case, the opening description of </p>
<p>the beast himself is quite short (v. 11 only), so that John might spend </p>
<p>most of the narrative describing its activities (vv. 12–17). As with the </p>
<p>former beast, John’s major focus is on the response of the earth and its </p>
<p>inhabitants.</p>
<p>e brief description of the second beast is set forth as a parody </p>
<p>of the Lamb; thus it had two horns like a lamb. But reality is that this </p>
<p>“lamb” spoke like a dragon. Furthermore, its reason for being (as with </p>
<p>the cult of the emperor) was to exercise all the authority of the rst </p>
<p>beast on its behalf, with the singular aim of making the earth and its </p>
<p>inhabitants worship the rst beast. However, even though the sec-</p>
<p>ond beast represents the cult of the emperor in some way, it seems less </p>
<p>likely that it does so in terms of an organized priesthood as such. More </p>
<p>likely what one is dealing with here are the local ocials who elsewhere </p>
<p>are called “the kings of the earth,” who have their authority from the </p>
<p>Empire/emperor. ese petty kings would enforce emperor worship not </p>
<p>at all for religious reasons but as a form of their own allegiance to the </p>
<p>emperor, not to mention for their own purposes—to establish a kind </p>
<p>of solidarity that gives their local rule more lasting power. In any case, </p>
<p>and picking up from what was said about the rst beast, John goes on to </p>
<p>remind his readers once more that the present “power” of the beast lies </p>
<p>with the fact its fatal wound had been healed. at is, having survived </p>
<p>the dreadful year of 69 CE (dreadful as far as the Empire itself was con-</p>
<p>cerned), the Empire had recovered from this “fatal wound,” aided now </p>
<p>especially by the priests of the cult of the emperor. So three decades or </p>
<p>so later the Empire and its emperor had the sense of total invincibility.</p>
<p>What appears next in John’s narrative is one of the more puzzling </p>
<p>moments in the book, as to whether John intended something in terms </p>
<p>of specics—and if so, what?—or whether this is simply analogical in </p>
<p>some way. In any case, much of what John has had to say about the </p>
<p>current beast (Rome) also had its analogous moments with Pharaoh’s </p>
<p>Egypt, from which God had rescued Israel. is appears to be another </p>
<p>such moment, although the specics are not part of the Exodus story. </p>
<p>What is analogous is that it performed great signs just as Pharaoh’s </p>
<p>magicians were able to do—to a very limited degree. What these pres-</p>
<p>ent “signs” may have consisted of cannot be known, but one of them </p>
<p>was even to cause re to come down from heaven to earth. is seems </p>
