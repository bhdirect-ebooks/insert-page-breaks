<p>Revelation 15–16</p>
<p>208</p>
<p>is nal set of seven (cf. chs. 6, 8–9)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>is now made up of the seven</p>
<p>bowls of God’s wrath, God’s judgments on Rome, six of which echo the </p>
<p>plagues of Egypt from Exodus 7–11. e probable reason for there be-</p>
<p>ing only six of them is that John at the same time has them correspond </p>
<p>in part to the seven trumpets of chapters 8 and 9 (see p. 209). us </p>
<p>in the earlier instance, regarding their relationship to the ten plagues </p>
<p>of Egypt, there were four correspondences in John (italicized below), </p>
<p>while the present plagues have six (underlined below):</p>
<p>1) Waters to blood (#2/3)</p>
<p>2) Frogs (#6)</p>
<p>3) Gnats</p>
<p>4) Flies</p>
<p>5) Death of livestock</p>
<p>6) Boils (#1)</p>
<p>7) Hail (#7)</p>
<p>8) Locusts</p>
<p>9) Darkness (#4)</p>
<p>10) Firstborn killed</p>
<p>Only the scorching sun from the fourth bowl poured out (16:8) is not </p>
<p>directly related to one of the seven trumpets, and in this case it reects </p>
<p>the fourth trumpet (utter darkness) in reverse. e probable reason </p>
<p>they do not all do so more directly is that John also has these seven </p>
<p>bowls correspond in part to the seven trumpets. us (the single cor-</p>
<p>respondence to the seals in bold):</p>
<p>1) Boils (6th plague)</p>
<p>2) Sea turned to blood (1st plague adapted to Rome = 2nd </p>
<p>trumpet)</p>
<p>3) Fresh water to blood (1st plague = 3rd trumpet)</p>
<p>4) Scorching heat of the sun (= 4th trumpet in reverse)</p>
<p>5) Darkness (9th plague = 4th trumpet)</p>
<p>6) e Euphrates dries up (= 6th trumpet, joined to the 2nd </p>
<p>plague [frogs])</p>
<p>1. See pp. 90–99 and 122–38 above for the discussions of these two prior sets of </p>
<p>seven.</p>
