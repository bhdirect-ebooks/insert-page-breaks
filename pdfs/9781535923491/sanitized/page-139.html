<p>apocalyptic or poetry allow one to do. us, picking up imagery and </p>
<p>echoes from Psalm 23:1–3 and Ezekiel 34, and by way of chapter 10 </p>
<p>in John’s own Gospel, the Lamb will in fact be their shepherd. So not </p>
<p>only is the Lamb introduced as “looking as if it had been slain” (5:6), </p>
<p>but now the once slain Lamb serves to “shepherd” the innumerable </p>
<p>heavenly throng of those who have been redeemed by his blood. So it is </p>
<p>the Lamb-turned-Shepherd who—now returning to Isaiah 49:10—will </p>
<p>lead them to springs of living water. is last image, well known from </p>
<p>John’s Gospel, has to do with “running water,” thus implying a stream, </p>
<p>where the water tumbling over the rocks and thus also taking in air is </p>
<p>kept fresh vis-à-vis the tepid water of a pool. is alone is the kind of </p>
<p>water that refreshes, and John is fully aware of the implications of his </p>
<p>imagery.</p>
<p>At the end of the scene John then adds, And God will wipe away </p>
<p>every tear from their eyes, thereby both echoing Isaiah 25:8 and an-</p>
<p>ticipating the nal eschatological scene of chapters 21 and 22. is, of </p>
<p>course, is striking imagery indicating that all reasons for human sorrow </p>
<p>will be banished forever. us the picture ends on the double notes of </p>
<p>eternal refreshment (“springs of living water”) and eternal peace and </p>
<p>rest (no more tears).</p>
<p>With these nal pictures, therefore, John reassures his readers that </p>
<p>they have been “sealed” by God so as to stand rm during the coming </p>
<p>hour of trial, and that even if they should die in the coming Holy War, </p>
<p>they will indeed receive the nal eschatological reward. All of this is </p>
<p>quite in keeping with the overall theology of the book: on the one hand, </p>
<p>God’s people are his redeemed ones, who are secure in Christ and thus </p>
<p>have a sure eschatological future; but at the same time they are followers </p>
<p>of the Lamb, and will go through great suering, by “washing their own </p>
<p>garments in the blood of the Lamb.” us in the language of the later </p>
<p>church, these two pictures are of the church militant and the church </p>
<p>triumphant. Everyone and everything is ultimately in God’s hands.</p>
