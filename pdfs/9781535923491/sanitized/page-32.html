<p>the “to him,” while the NJB reads “to him, then,” making sure the reader </p>
<p>recognizes that the pronoun “him” here refers to Christ, not to God </p>
<p>the Father. at this is John’s own intent is made certain by his use of </p>
<p>the personal pronoun (“to him”) rather than the relative pronoun (“to </p>
<p>whom”), which could only refer to the Father. e signicance of this </p>
<p>for the later reader is the especially high Christology that is assumed in </p>
<p>this doxology, which is directed from beginning to end to Christ him-</p>
<p>self, the one “who loves us and freed us from our sins by his blood.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, the praise that is due him (Christ) is that regularly </p>
<p>oered to God the Father: “glory and power.” “Glory” is one of those </p>
<p>biblical words that is so common that many, if not most, readers sim-</p>
<p>ply go on to what comes next. But if “glory” is sometimes an elusive </p>
<p>word, dicult to pin down with precision, it is the word used in the </p>
<p>Old Testament primarily to oer praise to the eternal God. At the very </p>
<p>outset of the Apocalypse, John sets it out as the primary word of doxol-</p>
<p>ogy now aorded to Christ. And such “glory” attributed to God is fre-</p>
<p>quently accompanied by recognition and acclamation of his “power”; </p>
<p>thus David sings of Yahweh, “Yours, LORD, is the greatness and the </p>
<p>power and the glory and the majesty and the splendor” (1 Chr 29:11). </p>
<p>For John the acclamation of such “glory and power” is now directed </p>
<p>toward the Son, “the faithful witness, the rstborn from the dead, and </p>
<p>the ruler of the kings of the earth.” What else, then, could John do but </p>
<p>conclude with a resounding Amen!, which means something like “so it </p>
<p>is and shall forever be.”</p>
<p>What happens next is even more surprising. One might well as-</p>
<p>sume the “amen” at the end of verse 6 is to mark the end of the saluta-</p>
<p>tion as such, which in a sense it was undoubtedly intended to do. But </p>
<p>before John moves on to identify himself and his readers, he bursts into </p>
<p>acclamation. First (v. 7), John celebrates the coming of Christ, with spe-</p>
<p>cial emphasis directed toward those who do not know him; and second </p>
(v. 8), he sets all of this out by way of divine armation. In so doing, he
<p>in the rst instance echoes several moments from the Old Testament </p>
<p>Prophets; then, second, he pronounces God the Father’s own stamp of </p>
<p>approval on what John is about to record for the sake of his reader and </p>
<p>hearers.</p>
<p>us John turns from doxology (vv. 5–6) to acclamation. Citing </p>
<p>rst a well-known passage from Daniel 7:13 and then reworking a pas-</p>
<p>sage from Zechariah (12:10) that had come to be understood as messi-</p>
