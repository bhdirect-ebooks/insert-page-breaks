<p>sexually immoral), six (the murderers), two (the idolaters), and nine </p>
<p>(everyone who loves and practices falsehood).</p>
<p>ese “last words” of Christ conclude rst with an explicit identi-</p>
<p>cation, I, Jesus, and then with a deliberate recall from the very begin-</p>
<p>ning of the book, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for </p>
<p>the churches. e plural “you” in this sentence, thus pointing to the </p>
<p>believers in the seven churches, is the giveaway that John understands </p>
<p>what Jesus is saying to him is intended for the churches themselves. </p>
<p>What the readers are to hear is that John is only the scribe of this great </p>
<p>vision, and that the vision itself comes to them ultimately from the liv-</p>
<p>ing and reigning Christ Jesus. is identication is then made explicit </p>
<p>by way of the two (or three) appositional identiers. First, Jesus identi-</p>
<p>es himself as the Root and the Ospring of David, where the two </p>
<p>nouns, typically, are intended to correspond to each other; that is, John </p>
<p>is here returning to the metaphor “root of David” from 5:5, where it </p>
<p>was preceded by “the Lion of the tribe of Judah,” and thus was a clear </p>
<p>referent to the Davidic Messiah. But at this distance from the earlier </p>
<p>clear referent John now makes sure his readers understand what “root </p>
<p>of David” means; it means “the Ospring of David.” With this language </p>
<p>the risen and ascended Jesus arms what the early church had come to </p>
<p>believe about him: that he was God’s Messiah for the redemption and </p>
<p>healing of the nations.</p>
<p>With the nal identier, the bright Morning Star, John returns to </p>
<p>the one that rst appeared in Jesus’ message to the fourth church, the </p>
<p>middle one of the seven, located in yatira. ere Christ promised </p>
<p>that they would be given “the morning star,” and as was pointed out </p>
<p>earlier, this puzzling identier remains as something of a mystery. Its </p>
<p>only Old Testament appearance is in Isaiah 14:12, where its immediate </p>
<p>referent is also a puzzle to Old Testament scholars, although its most </p>
<p>likely referent is to the fall of the king of Babylon. In any case, one can </p>
<p>hardly read the Isaiah passage as something positive. Very likely this is </p>
<p>yet another instance where John has taken over imagery that formerly </p>
<p>had negative connotations and “baptized” it as something altogether </p>
<p>positive.</p>
