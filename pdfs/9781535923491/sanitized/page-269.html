<p>e Fall of Babylon the Great</p>
<p>247</p>
<p>Although this oracle begins with a warning to God’s own people to </p>
<p>“come out” of Babylon, the major part of it is in fact a doom oracle, </p>
<p>calling for God’s just judgments on Rome for all her iniquities. Since </p>
<p>everything now focuses on the oracle as such, John introduces it with </p>
<p>simply another voice from heaven, which he heard. As happens regu-</p>
<p>larly in the narrative, beginning with chapter 10, and picked up in our </p>
<p>present verse 1, John’s own perspective is again that of being on the </p>
<p>earth. e oracle itself is expressed in three clear parts: rst is a call for </p>
<p>God’s people to abandon Babylon, including the reason for her demise </p>
<p>(vv. 4–5); second is a call to those executing judgment to pay her back </p>
<p>double for all her sins (vv. 6–7a); and third is the pronouncement of </p>
<p>doom itself, including its cause (v. 7b) and its nature and certainty (vv. </p>
<p>7b–8).</p>
<p>e call for John’s own readers to be prepared to abandon Rome </p>
<p>begins with language borrowed from Jeremiah 51:45: Come out of her, </p>
<p>my people.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>But whereas the Jeremiah oracle had to do with ight</p>
<p>from Babylon because of Yahweh’s coming judgments on her, John’s </p>
<p>reasons for Christian believers to ee Rome are primarily existential, </p>
<p>representing two sides of the same coin: rst, that God’s own people </p>
<p>will not share in her sins, and second, that they therefore not receive </p>
<p>any of her plagues. In light of some of the conditions in the churches </p>
<p>noted in chapter 2 and 3, one must take this invitation/warning seri-</p>
<p>ously, as something that must be heeded, if Christ’s own people are </p>
<p>not to suer the coming fate of the Empire. Although “her sins” are </p>
<p>not specied here, they did appear at the end of the sounding of the </p>
<p>sixth trumpet (9:20–21), mostly in terms of breaking several of the Ten </p>
<p>Commandments (worshiping demons by worshiping idols, murder, </p>
<p>magic arts, sexual immorality, and the). e promised plagues, of </p>
<p>course, are those narrated in the three sets of sevens in chapters 6, 8–9, </p>
<p>and 16.</p>
<p>In typical fashion the next line of the poetry oers the reasons </p>
<p>for the coming judgment, expressed in grand terms: for her sins are </p>
<p>piled up to heaven. Here again, John is borrowing language from the </p>
<p>Jeremiah oracle, this time from 51:9, where the prophet laments,</p>
<p>reader of the commentary, so that one might see the three parts more clearly.</p>
<p>11. Jeremiah’s oracle reads, “Come out of her, my people! Run for your lives!”</p>
