<p>Revelation 1:17–20</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>One should note nally that everything about this vision is in-</p>
tended to describe a theophany, a divine self-revelation. First, there is
<p>the careful collage of images that combine the heavenly and earthly Son </p>
<p>of Man, and do so with images used only for God. Second, there is the </p>
<p>prostrate John, who is reassured with the “right hand” and the “do not </p>
<p>be afraid” that he is safe in the Divine Presence. But especially, third, </p>
<p>there is the self-disclosure language of verses 17–18, language that de-</p>
<p>liberately echoes God’s own language in verse 8. For John all of this is </p>
<p>certied by the resurrection: “I was dead, and now look, I am alive for </p>
<p>ever and ever!” For John that is the “key” to everything that follows; </p>
<p>having experienced death, Christ through his resurrection has stripped </p>
<p>Satan of his means of power—death and Hades—and thus “holds the </p>
<p>keys” for loosing from Satan’s grip those who are his own.</p>
<p>e christophany itself is then followed by the commission given </p>
<p>to John to write . . . what you have seen, which is then elaborated so </p>
<p>that his readers will understand that what follows has to do with both </p>
<p>what is now and what will take place later.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>e rest of the book then</p>
<p>follows along these lines. Chapters 2 through 5 are all about “what is </p>
<p>now,” while chapters 6–11 are about “what will take place later.” ese </p>
<p>two concerns are then taken up in greater detail in chapters 12–14 and </p>
<p>15–22, respectively. But before any of that, John is given the interpreta-</p>
<p>tion of the two sets of seven, the seven stars and the seven golden lamp-</p>
<p>stands, since these items will gure signicantly, as the rst matters, in </p>
<p>what follows (chs. 2–3).</p>
<p>Couched in the language of Jewish apocalyptic, what is being in-</p>
<p>terpreted is the mystery of the seven stars . . . and of the seven golden </p>
<p>lampstands. e seven stars, John is told, are the angels [angeloi] of </p>
<p>the seven churches, while the seven lampstands are the seven church-</p>
<p>es. e word angeloi is one of the more dicult to put into English in </p>
<p>much of this book, since its basic meaning is simply “messenger”; but in </p>
<p>the Greek Old Testament it was used especially to refer to the heavenly </p>
<p>messengers who have been regularly referred to as “angels” in English. </p>
<p>17. e NIV seems to have understood John’s intent correctly here, whose text in </p>
<p>the Greek reads (literally): “what you have seen and what is and what is about to hap-</p>
<p>pen aer these things.” e reason for adopting the NIV’s rendering is a recognition </p>
<p>that the three verbs “saw, are, will be” are not in fact coordinate—and almost certainly </p>
<p>were not intended to be. at is, the rst verb (in the past tense) has to do with John </p>
<p>and what he has “seen” in the pictures that follow, while the second and third verbs </p>
<p>have to do with the present situation of the churches and what lies ahead for them.</p>
