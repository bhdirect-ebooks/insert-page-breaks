<p>e Letters to the Seven Churches</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>e seven letters themselves tend to follow a similar pattern, al-</p>
<p>though some items found in the rst letter are missing here and there </p>
<p>in the letters that follow. First up always is Christ himself, who is con-</p>
<p>sistently presented with the introductory “these are the words of . . .” </p>
<p>e depiction of Christ that follows then picks up some dimension of </p>
<p>the imagery from 1:12–16. is is then followed by words of praise and/</p>
<p>or censure for the church itself. ese in turn are followed by words </p>
<p>of warning (sometimes followed by further praise), with a concluding </p>
<p>word of admonition (the one consistent element in all of the letters) </p>
<p>and/or nal promise. When one gets to the letter to Sardis (3:1–6) the </p>
<p>more universal nature of all the letters becomes obvious, since the con-</p>
<p>cluding promise to the “overcomers” reads, “those who are victorious </p>
<p>will, like them, be dressed in white.” e “like them” picks up the im-</p>
<p>mediately preceding promise to the faithful in Sardis, who “will walk </p>
<p>with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy.” e clear implication is </p>
<p>that the promise made to the Sardinian believers will also be true of the </p>
<p>“victorious” believers in all the churches, and thus to all those who are </p>
<p>reading everyone else’s mail.</p>
<p>To the Church in Ephesus (2:1–7)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“To the angel</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> of the church in Ephesus write:</p>
<p>ese are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his </p>
<p>right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands: </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>I </p>
<p>know your deeds, your hard work and your perseverance. I know </p>
<p>that you cannot tolerate wicked people, that you have tested those </p>
<p>who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name, </p>
<p>and have not grown weary.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken the love you </p>
<p>had at rst. </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Consider how far you have fallen! Repent and do the </p>
<p>things you did at rst. If you do not repent, I will come to you and </p>
<p>remove your lampstand from its place. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>But you have this in your </p>
<p>favor: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the </p>
<p>churches. To those who are victorious, I will give the right to eat </p>
<p>from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.</p>
<p>1. Or messenger.</p>
