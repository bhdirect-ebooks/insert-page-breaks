<p>e Seven Bowls Are Poured Out</p>
<p>217</p>
<p>15:5 in the preamble to this passage, out of which the seven angels had </p>
<p>come. e “loud voice” in this case spoke not to John, but to the seven </p>
<p>angels themselves, with the command, Go, pour out the seven bowls </p>
<p>of God’s wrath on the earth. All of this is in keeping with John’s literary </p>
<p>method throughout, with an introduction many of whose elements are </p>
<p>then repeated in the unfolding of the narrative itself.</p>
<p>us the rst angel went and poured out his bowl on the land. </p>
<p>at this is imagery, pure and simple, is highlighted here by the fact </p>
<p>that there is no content as such in the bowls—they were introduced </p>
<p>only as expressions of God’s wrath. In keeping with similar imagery </p>
<p>throughout the narrative, the rst part of the earth to be aected is the </p>
<p>land. But the result in this case is something new in terms of its eects: </p>
<p>ugly, festering sores broke out (cf. Exod 9:10). Not surprisingly, this </p>
<p>happened to those who had become compliant with the Empire and its </p>
<p>way of life, and thus is expressed in the language of chapter 13. us the </p>
<p>“sores broke out” on the people who had the mark of the beast and </p>
worshiped its image. Again it takes the form of a divine reversal, in
<p>keeping with the biblical law of lex talionis (“an eye for an eye”). What </p>
<p>the Empire dished out on those who refused to go along with its ungod-</p>
<p>ly ways and policies will be what they receive in kind. is, of course, </p>
<p>functions not as a warning to the Empire itself, but to those believers </p>
<p>who might be tempted to accommodate to it in order to survive.</p>
<p>Again, typical both of the book as a whole and of the basic human </p>
<p>understanding of the earth, the second angel poured out his bowl on </p>
<p>the sea, meaning of course the salt water sea that most of the Western </p>
<p>world knew: the Mediterranean (literally “the sea between the lands”). </p>
<p>As before, the sea turned into blood (see 8:7), but now not just a third </p>
<p>of it did so. John goes on to describe it as blood like that of a dead </p>
<p>person, a comparison that is not especially immediate to the reader, </p>
<p>since that would ordinarily mean something like “coagulated.” But de-</p>
<p>spite the grammar itself, one wonders whether the intent of this rather </p>
<p>clipped expression was simply a person whose blood had been poured </p>
<p>out thus causing death.</p>
<p>In the same manner as with the third trumpet, the third angel </p>
<p>poured out his bowl on the fresh waters, but now with dierent results. </p>
<p>ere the waters turned bitter and led to many deaths; here the rivers </p>
<p>of Isa 66:6: “Hear that noise from the temple! It is the sound of the LORD repaying his </p>
<p>enemies all they deserve.”</p>
