<p>“temple.” But for John the biblical story would not be complete without </p>
<p>a “new Jerusalem,” hence the signicance of this material; and only then </p>
<p>is the reader promised a restored Eden (22:1–5).</p>
<p>e Physical Description of the City, Part 1 (21:9–14)</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven </p>
<p>last plagues came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the </p>
<p>bride, the wife of the Lamb.” </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>And he carried me away in the </p>
<p>Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, </p>
<p>Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>It shone with </p>
<p>the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious </p>
<p>jewel, like jasper, clear as crystal. </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>It had a great, high wall with </p>
<p>twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were </p>
<p>written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>ere were three </p>
<p>gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three </p>
<p>on the west. </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>e wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on </p>
<p>them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</p>
<p>In a rare moment in this book, most of the rst two sentences of the </p>
<p>present description basically repeat what was said in verse 2 above. But </p>
<p>now, and in keeping with his style throughout, John seeks to hold the </p>
<p>various parts of his narrative together by having the next event orches-</p>
<p>trated by one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls of the last </p>
<p>seven plagues. ese angels rst appear in the narrative in 15:1, while </p>
<p>their activities are narrated in chapter 16. Now this angel came and said </p>
<p>to John, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.” But </p>
<p>now, in an apparently deliberate contrast to the vision of the former </p>
<p>“woman,” the harlot Rome—where John had been transported “into a </p>
<p>wilderness” (17:3)—this angel now carried John away in the Spirit to </p>
<p>a mountain great and high. Again, this reects the historic tradition of </p>
<p>ancient Israel, whose poets loved to sing of Jerusalem’s “loy splendor.” </p>
<p>us Psalm 48 begins,</p>
<p>Great is the Lord, and most worthy of praise</p>
<p> in the city of our God, his holy mountain.</p>
<p>Beautiful in its loiness, the joy of the whole earth,</p>
<p> like the heights of Zaphon is Mount Zion,</p>
<p> the city of the Great King.</p>
