<p>Fusing the Horizons: Christ and His Church(es)</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>constant temptation to put the emphasis on the churches themselves, since </p>
<p>John’s emphasis is on Christ’s knowledge of these churches, which is being </p>
<p>revealed here to one and all. Much of this, therefore, is especially difﬁcult </p>
<p>to apply to the present situation in western Christendom. It is not that we </p>
<p>do not have a variety of churches with a variety of degrees of faithfulness </p>
and otherwise; rather it is the fact that most of our churches are individual-
<p>ized in such a way that we are conveniently isolated from each other, and </p>
<p>therefore ﬁnd it easy to hide our “dirty linen.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, following the lead of Craig Koester,</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>one can summarize</p>
<p>the analogies between us and them as follows:</p>
<p>1. The problem of Assimilation. Very much the same way one can </p>
<p>boil a frog by placing it in cold water and then turning on the heat, so the </p>
<p>church, which of necessity must be in the world, at the same time is con-</p>
<p>stantly, and often quite unwittingly, in danger of becoming like the world in </p>
<p>which it is situated. This has been especially true of Western Christendom, </p>
<p>and especially so in times of plenty, when the church tends to enjoy the </p>
<p>same “upward mobility” experienced by the majority of the middle class, as </p>
<p>they try to emulate the wealthy. The upshot of such assimilation is that the </p>
<p>church has rather totally lost its prophetic voice, calling out God’s coming </p>
<p>judgments on the world to which it has so easily accommodated itself. At </p>
<p>this point we must once again prophesy to the world, not simply to change </p>
<p>the world, but to keep it from changing us.</p>
<p>2. The problem of Complacency, which is closely related to the forego-</p>
<p>ing problem. Perhaps there is no bigger crisis in the churches of the Western </p>
<p>world than this one, where the church seems to be more often full of “fans” </p>
<p>rather than of followers of Jesus. Indeed, if being a Christian were a crime, </p>
<p>it is doubtful whether there would be enough evidence to indict the many of </p>
<p>us, who have settled into a Christianity of mediocrity rather than of burning </p>
<p>passion to be Christ’s own people in this fallen, broken world. We tend to </p>
<p>have just enough “religion” to make us basically inconspicuous in a world </p>
<p>of self-centeredness, greed, and broken relationships. Hopefully, a careful </p>
<p>reading of John’s Revelation might be able to change some of that.</p>
<p>3. The Problem of Persecution. Here is what faces millions of followers </p>
<p>of the Cruciﬁed One in much of the world, but is unfortunately lacking in </p>
<p>the West—“unfortunate” because persecution always has a way of purifying </p>
<p>in ways that abundance does not. Also unfortunately, the lack of external </p>
