<p>‘Come out of her my people,’</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>so that you will not share in her sins,</p>
<p>so that you will not receive any of her plagues</p>
<p>us the main themes are clear. e church and state are on a col-</p>
<p>lision course of some magnitude over who runs the universe, and John </p>
<p>fully recognizes that power and victory presently appear to belong to </p>
<p>the state. But because of Rome’s arrogance and oppression, God will </p>
<p>bring her to ruin. us (still in ch. 18):</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Give back to her as she has given;</p>
<p>pay her back double for what she has done.</p>
<p>Pour her a double portion from her own cup.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Give her as much torment and grief</p>
<p>as the glory and luxury she gave herself.</p>
<p>In her heart she boasts,</p>
<p>‘I sit enthroned as queen; I am not a widow,</p>
<p>and I will never mourn.’ [Isa 47:7, 8]</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>erefore in one day her plagues will overtake her:</p>
<p>death, mourning and famine.</p>
<p>She will be consumed by re,</p>
<p>for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.</p>
<p>With her will be all the petty kings, seamen, and merchants who have </p>
<p>courted her (vv. 9–19). And at the heart of everything is the cult of </p>
<p>the emperor, who had begun by now to be “worshiped” as “Lord and </p>
<p>Savior”!</p>
<p>us John rst of all warns the church that suering and death lie </p>
<p>ahead. Indeed, he has the prophetic insight to recognize that it will get </p>
<p>worse, far worse, before it ever gets better; and his primary concern for </p>
<p>the churches is that they do not cave in under the coming pogrom they </p>
<p>are about to experience. us the various texts that serve as warnings:</p>
<p>If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives its mark </p>
<p>on their forehead or on their hand, they, too will drink of the wine </p>
<p>of God’s fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of </p>
<p>his wrath. (14:9–10)</p>
<p>Come out of her, my people, so that you will not share in her sins, </p>
<p>so that you will not receive any of her plagues. (18:4)</p>
<p>2. Jeremiah 51:45.</p>
