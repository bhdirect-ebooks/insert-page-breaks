<p>e Great Multitude in White Robes</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>of assurance to his readers, some of whom are currently being battered </p>
<p>by the state.</p>
<p>John again makes his transition to this scene with the phrase af-</p>
<p>ter this I looked, followed by a description of what was there before </p>
<p>me. e upfront matter in the present description is an explicit twofold </p>
<p>contrast to the immediately prior scene (vv. 1–8). First, the great mul-</p>
<p>titude is so large that no one could count it, which at the same time </p>
<p>reinforces the preceding numbering as having to do with the complete </p>
<p>number of God’s people, rather than a precise number. Second, and </p>
<p>now reecting the song to the Lamb in 5:9, not just Israel but all peoples </p>
<p>(every nation, tribe, people and language) here enter into loud praise </p>
<p>to God and to the Lamb. Regarding this fourfold listing of the world’s </p>
<p>peoples, see the additional note on 5:9 above (p. 85, n. 24). It is of some </p>
<p>interest that the list in this instance begins with “nation,” the word that </p>
<p>concluded the rst listing. Since no one of these seven lists is identical, </p>
<p>one should perhaps not make much of the order in this case; nonethe-</p>
<p>less here John begins with the broadest term before narrowing it down </p>
<p>to “language,” the term that most explicitly delineates the dierences </p>
<p>between “peoples.” In any case, the reality that what constitutes God’s </p>
<p>people now goes far beyond Israel is one of John’s repeated concerns </p>
<p>throughout this narrative.</p>
<p>Picking up the setting from our chapter 5, John then species that </p>
<p>this innumerable multitude is standing before the throne and before </p>
<p>the Lamb. However, despite the case specic language “that places John </p>
<p>before both God and the Lamb,” John’s concern is not positional in the </p>
<p>ordinary sense, but in the much greater theological sense. What is being </p>
<p>armed here is that God’s people are to be understood as “at home” in </p>
<p>the Divine Presence. us, not only are they the ones “who could with-</p>
stand the great day of divine wrath” (6:17), but they are now pictured
<p>as nally “standing before the throne” and thus in God’s very presence. </p>
<p>ey are further described, in language echoing 3:4, as wearing white </p>
<p>robes, which will be elaborated further in verse 14 (cf. also 19:8); and </p>
<p>nally, they are noted as holding palm branches in their hands, clearly </p>
<p>echoing Psalm 118:27.</p>
<p>is last feature, their “holding palm branches in their hands,” is </p>
<p>an especially Johannine touch, stemming from his own description of </p>
<p>the “triumphal entry” in John 12:13, where he alone of the Gospel writ-</p>
<p>ers indicates that the branches were from nearby “palm trees.” is bit </p>
