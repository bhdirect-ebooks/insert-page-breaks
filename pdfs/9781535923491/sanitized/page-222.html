<p>RE VEL ATION 14 :14 –20</p>
<p>Prelude to the (Original) Tale of Two Cities</p>
<p>In what has turned out to be for many readers (and interpreters) one </p>
<p>of the more puzzling moments in the book, the next thing up in John’s </p>
<p>narrative is a pair of agricultural metaphors, both of them intrinsic to </p>
<p>the Middle Eastern culture of John’s time, and one of which (the grain </p>
<p>harvest) has had something of a clouded history of interpretation. At </p>
<p>issue historically are the two essential questions of interpretation: con-</p>
<p>text and content. Although the overall content in itself is generally clear </p>
<p>enough—John is simply presenting two metaphors of harvest, one of </p>
<p>grain, the other of grapes</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>—there has been little agreement on the rst </p>
<p>of these, whether it is a gathering of the “saints” or the rst of two pic-</p>
<p>tures of judgment.</p>
<p>Of even greater diculty has been the question of context, so </p>
<p>much so that a considerable majority of interpreters more or less leave </p>
<p>this question alone, in terms either of its role in the narrative itself or </p>
<p>(especially) how it ts at this point in the narrative. And here is a place, </p>
<p>it would seem, that the insertion of locational numbers (i.e., chapters </p>
<p>and verses) into the text may very well have gotten in the way of coming </p>
<p>to terms with what John intended. One wonders, for example, if in the </p>
<p>numbering system these twin narratives had begun our chapter 15, as I </p>
<p>am suggesting here, whether that might not have oered interpreters of </p>
<p>the last several centuries better clues as to what John intended. In any </p>
<p>case, contextually one can make very good sense of the overall structure </p>
<p>of the book by seeing these two corresponding visions as a deliberate </p>
<p>prelude to the (original) “tale of two cities” that follows.</p>
<p>In this view, the rest of the book thus takes on a common chiastic </p>
<p>AB-BA pattern, wherein the present two scenes of harvest (one as posi-</p>
<p>tive and the other negative) serve to introduce in reverse order God’s </p>
<p>coming judgments. us, rst up aer these two scenes is the (negative) </p>
<p>tale of the rst city, Rome, whose doom is announced with unrelenting </p>
<p>1. us bread and wine.</p>
