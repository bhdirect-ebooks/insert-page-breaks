<p>e Defeat of the Dragon in Heaven</p>
<p>171</p>
<p>and the Son: Now have come the salvation and the power and the </p>
<p>kingdom of our God and the authority of his Messiah. Although the </p>
<p>combination of “salvation,” “power,” and “kingdom” is unique to this </p>
<p>passage, it is quite in keeping both with previous acclamations</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>especially with John’s present concerns. His readers thus need to be </p>
<p>reminded at the outset that their eternal salvation is a reality, whatever </p>
<p>may happen to them at the hands of Rome. At the same time, and es-</p>
<p>pecially in light of the coming holocaust, he reminds them that God’s </p>
<p>power and kingdom have already (“now”) taken hold through the death </p>
<p>and resurrection of Christ, a reality alluded to in the preceding picture </p>
<p>of Satan’s attempt to destroy the seed of the woman (vv. 4–5).</p>
<p>e reason for the present condence of these believers goes back </p>
<p>to the introductory narrative in verses 7–9, where Satan was pictured </p>
<p>as cast out of heaven. ey are now to understand this reality in terms </p>
<p>of the salvation aected by Christ through his death and resurrection—</p>
<p>the arena in which Satan suered his ultimate defeat. us, as a way of </p>
<p>encouraging them, the heavenly voice goes on to arm the ultimate </p>
<p>defeat of Satan by here arming his essential defeat through the cross </p>
<p>and resurrection of Christ, even though that is not expressly stated in </p>
<p>the current poetry. Rather, still aware of their present (and coming) </p>
<p>plight, John goes on to explain the ultimate source of their hardships: </p>
<p>the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our </p>
<p>God day and night, has been hurled down. By putting it this way, John </p>
<p>also leaves his readers with some locational ambiguity in terms of his </p>
<p>imagery. On the one hand, even though Satan is here pictured as cast </p>
<p>out of heaven and “hurled to the earth,” he is nonetheless continually </p>
<p>accusing God’s people (“day and night”). e point, of course, has to do </p>
<p>with the everyday reality of being a follower of the Lamb in their pres-</p>
<p>ent circumstances; Satan is, and will be, the continuing source of their </p>
<p>coming (and ongoing) diculties. On the other hand, in their present </p>
<p>“between the times” existence, Satan is at the same time seen as having </p>
<p>lost his place in heaven and “hurled down” to earth, where he will incite </p>
<p>the two beasts to wreak havoc on the people who constantly remind </p>
<p>him of his ultimate defeat.</p>
<p>But if John presents the reader with something of a hiccup as to </p>
<p>Satan’s actual whereabouts, his present point is not Satan’s heavenly </p>
<p>10. See the discussion of 5:12–13 above (pp. 84–88).</p>
