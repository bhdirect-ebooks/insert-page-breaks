<p>Revelation 5:5–6</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>in this nal mention, since he is now described altogether in terms of </p>
<p>his relationship to the Son, as the “seven horns and seven eyes”</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>of the</p>
<p>Lamb. us with these words to John (v. 5) and the initial description of </p>
<p>the Son as the Slain Lamb, whose seven eyes represent the Holy Spirit, </p>
<p>the stage is set for the nal scene: the response of the heavenly court in </p>
<p>anticipation of the action of the Lamb.</p>
<p>The Lamb Takes the Scroll and Heaven Rejoices (5:7–13)</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>He went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat </p>
<p>on the throne. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>And when he had taken it, the four living creatures </p>
<p>and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one </p>
<p>had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, </p>
<p>which are the prayers of God’s people. </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>And they sang a new song, </p>
<p>saying:</p>
<p>“You are worthy to take the scroll</p>
<p> and to open its seals,</p>
<p>because you were slain,</p>
<p> and with your blood you purchased for God</p>
<p> members of every tribe and language and people and nation.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our </p>
<p>God,</p>
<p> and they will reign</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> on the earth.”</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>en I looked and heard the voice of many angels, numbering </p>
<p>thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand. </p>
<p>ey encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders. </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>In a loud voice they were saying:</p>
<p>“Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain,</p>
<p> to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength</p>
<p> and honor and glory and praise!”</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>en I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under </p>
<p>the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, saying:</p>
<p>“To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb</p>
<p> be praise and honor and glory and power,</p>
<p> for ever and ever!”</p>
<p>the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who </p>
<p>goes out from the Father . . .”</p>
<p>21. e phrase “seven eyes of the Lord” appears in Zech 4:10, and is most likely the </p>
<p>OT source of John’s description.</p>
<p>22. Some manuscripts they reign.</p>
