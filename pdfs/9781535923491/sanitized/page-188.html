<p>Revelation 12:1–6</p>
<p>166</p>
<p>that follows, one might assume the dragon to be identical with the beast </p>
<p>in 13:1. But that is an identication John will not allow us to make, even </p>
<p>though he deliberately draws the closest kind of association between </p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>Second, and now picking up from verse 4a, the dragon is further </p>
<p>identied in terms of Daniel 8:10, where the enemy of God’s people </p>
<p>is described as a “horn” growing up “until it reached the host of the </p>
<p>heavens, and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and </p>
<p>trampled on them.” In the present scene the dragon’s tail swept a third </p>
<p>of the stars out of the sky and ung them to the earth. Although this </p>
<p>may very well be, as some think, a reference to Satan’s attempt to de-</p>
<p>stroy Israel, it nevertheless serves here primarily as an identity marker, </p>
<p>thereby setting up for Satan’s being cast out of heaven.</p>
<p>As the nal matter in this description, the dragon and the woman </p>
<p>are brought face to face as it were. As the woman [Israel] . . . was about </p>
<p>to give birth, the dragon stood in front of her so that it might devour </p>
<p>her child the moment he was born. is is drama, pure and simple, </p>
<p>in which the basic Christian story is being replayed at the outset of </p>
<p>the second half of the book, with its essential matters being featured.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Whether it is also a reection on the Matthean birth narrative itself is </p>
<p>moot. More likely it is a (signicantly) condensed version of the gospel </p>
<p>story; this seems to be made clear when this part of John’s narrative </p>
<p>concludes by pointing to the birth and ascension of Jesus. us the es-</p>
<p>sential story itself begins with the incarnation. e sun-clothed woman </p>
<p>gave birth to a son, a male child, who is immediately described further </p>
<p>in the language of Psalm 2:9: he will rule all the nations with an iron </p>
<p>scepter. is signicantly condensed account of the essential story then </p>
<p>concludes with the ascension: And her child was snatched up to God </p>
<p>and to his throne. By bookending the story in this way, John makes </p>
<p>it clear that what was currently happening to the Messiah’s people </p>
<p>on earth does not lie outside Christ’s own purview. e Divine Child </p>
<p>5. is also accounts for the slight locational roughness that emerges in this telling </p>
<p>of the story, since the whole scene takes place in heaven (vv. 1 and 3), but in v. 6 the </p>
<p>woman appears on earth, and will do so for the rest of the narrative, when she reap-</p>
<p>pears in vv. 13–17. e present scene takes place in heaven because John’s primary </p>
<p>“geographical” concern throughout the present passage is the placement of the dragon </p>
<p>in heaven, from whence he will be cast out in the next scene.</p>
