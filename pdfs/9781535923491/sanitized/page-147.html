<p>e First Four Trumpets and the First Eagle</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>of John’s writing Rome’s existence was dependent altogether on imports </p>
from elsewhere in the Empire. us the divine judgment in this nal
<p>case resulted in a third of the ships being destroyed.</p>
<p>With the third angel, the judgments again come from above. </p>
<p>us when the angel sounded his trumpet . . . a great star, blazing </p>
<p>like a torch, fell from the sky. In this case the star is given a name, </p>
<p>Wormwood, a non-poisonous, bitter plant sometimes used for me-</p>
<p>dicinal purposes, but here most likely reecting its bitterness as such. </p>
<p>Again, the phenomenon described is most likely an apocalyptic ref-</p>
<p>erence to something known to the readers, probably to a destructive </p>
<p>meteorite that has made its way to the earth. In this case the judgment </p>
<p>is against the fresh waters in that it fell . . . on a third of the rivers and </p>
<p>on the springs of water. But rather than being turned to blood in this </p>
<p>case, a third of the waters were turned bitter. is appears to be a rst-</p>
<p>century description of contaminated or poisoned waters, which when </p>
<p>drunk in this case caused many people to die from the waters that had </p>
<p>become bitter. As it turns out this is the only plague that is explicitly </p>
<p>directed toward the people themselves.</p>
<p>Finally, when the fourth angel sounded his trumpet the heavenly </p>
<p>bodies themselves are seen to be aected by human rebellion against </p>
<p>God. is is very much in keeping with—indeed it is a clear echo of—</p>
<p>the ninth plague in Exodus 10:21–23, where the heavenly lights of both </p>
<p>the day and the night are themselves darkened. us when the light of </p>
<p>day, the sun, and the lights of night, the moon and the stars, are struck, </p>
<p>a third of them turned dark, which is further elaborated to mean that </p>
<p>a third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night.</p>
<p>In this case, however, John is at the same time reecting the “mes-</p>
<p>sianic woes” found throughout the Jewish prophetic and apocalyptic </p>
<p>writings, where supernatural disasters are pictured as part of the Day </p>
<p>of Yahweh. us, for example, God speaks through the prophet Joel </p>
<p>(2:30–31):</p>
<p>I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth;</p>
<p> blood and re and billows of smoke.</p>
<p>e sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood,</p>
<p> before the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>5. One might compare with this other such texts in the Jewish Apocrypha, includ-</p>
<p>ing 4 Ezra 5:1–12; 6:21–24; 2 Bar. 27:1–10; A. Mos. 10:4–5. Cf. also Matt 24:29.</p>
