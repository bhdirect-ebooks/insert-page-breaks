<p>mate reasons for their suering, which nds its present expression in </p>
<p>the Empire’s unyielding attitude toward those who refuse to call the </p>
Emperor “lord” or to acknowledge that he is in any way divine. us the
<p>emperor will be pictured as the “beast coming out of the earth” (13:11), </p>
<p>while the Empire itself is the “beast coming out of the sea” (13:1). e </p>
<p>greater diculty for the later reader is with the present imagery, whose </p>
<p>conclusion in verse 17 is the point of everything, but whose details and </p>
<p>intent in verses 14–16 are more of a mystery. One’s hope for under-</p>
<p>standing lies with the fact that the whole passage assumes Genesis 3:15 </p>
<p>as its primary background, where Yahweh’s judgment on the serpent </p>
<p>includes, “I will put enmity between you and the woman, between your </p>
<p>ospring and hers; he [her ospring] will crush your head, and you </p>
<p>will strike his heel.” In many ways the biblical story is the unfolding </p>
<p>of this enmity, this initiating moment of the Holy War motif. In the </p>
<p>larger biblical story the three primary embodiments of Satan’s seed are </p>
<p>the Egyptians, the Canaanites, and the Babylonians. John is particularly </p>
<p>interested in Egypt and Babylon, both of whom he sees as embodied in </p>
<p>the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>e narrative itself begins simply enough. e dragon, whose role </p>
<p>John now proceeds to narrate, having seen that he had been hurled to </p>
<p>the earth, chooses to avenge himself by pursuing the woman who had </p>
<p>given birth to the male child. is part seems easy enough; the more </p>
<p>dicult interpretive issue has to do with verses 14–16, as to where they </p>
<p>t into the larger narrative of the present book. John’s point of refer-</p>
<p>ence is plain enough: Israel’s historical escape from Egypt as narrated </p>
<p>in Exodus 12:31 through 15:21. At issue is whether this is a recounting </p>
<p>of that history, so as to bring the story up to the birth of the Messiah, or </p>
<p>whether it is in some way picturing a New Exodus of the followers of </p>
<p>Christ. e most likely interpretation seems to be that verses 13–16 are </p>
<p>an apocalyptic retelling of the story of Israel—as “the woman who had </p>
<p>given birth to the male child”—but in such a way that the two stories </p>
<p>(the Old and New) merge at the present point where Satan, through the </p>
<p>Empire, is now pursuing Israel’s new, and therefore true, ospring, the </p>
<p>followers of the Slain Lamb.</p>
<p>In this view, then, our verses 14–16 are a new, apocalyptic retelling </p>
<p>of the essential story of the former covenant, where Israel’s ight from </p>
<p>Egypt is pictured in terms of the woman being given the two wings of </p>
<p>a great eagle, so that she might y to the place prepared for her in </p>
