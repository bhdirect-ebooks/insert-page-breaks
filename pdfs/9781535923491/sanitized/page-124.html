<p>Revelation 6:1–17</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>fulllment of that prophetic word. John’s narrative indicates that such </p>
<p>people would much prefer death from so-called acts of God rather than </p>
<p>having to face the eternal God himself, Father and Son, in the place of </p>
<p>judgment. us they want to be hidden from the face of him who sits </p>
<p>on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb. It turns out, therefore, </p>
<p>that their eeing to the mountains is not for refuge from the earthquake </p>
<p>as such but rather from God’s wrath, which they recognize to be present </p>
<p>in the shaking of the sky and land.</p>
<p>e content of the sixth seal concludes with all these people, “the </p>
<p>mighty” and lesser ones together, giving the reason for their preference </p>
for death by earthquake rather than to experience divine exposure.
<p>us they ask the second great question that will be taken up in the </p>
<p>rest of this book. Acknowledging that the great day of their wrath has </p>
<p>come, they ask, who can withstand it?</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>us the martyrs ask, “how</p>
<p>long?” and those responsible for their plight ask, “who can withstand </p>
the divine wrath?” We need here to note by way of anticipation that
<p>chapter 7 oers the immediate response to the latter question, while </p>
chapter 8 oers the rst expression of the divine wrath. e rest of the book then goes on to spell out the reasons for the divine wrath and the
<p>nature of the salvation oered to God’s own people—who are soon to </p>
<p>experience human wrath of considerable proportions.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Getting One’s Priorities in Order</p>
<p>In the materials that follow, from chapters 7 through 17, John offers a </p>
<p>relentless picture of God’s judgments, both temporal and eternal, against </p>
<p>Rome and its empire for their role in the upcoming onslaught of God’s </p>
<p>people—which actually transpired during the two centuries following the </p>
<p>writing of this document. But John also has his priorities fully in order, so he </p>
<p>does not begin with the coming assault. Rather he begins with these marvel-</p>
<p>ous pictures of heaven, with focus on “the One sitting on the throne” and on </p>
<p>“the slain Lamb.” Only then, in our chapter 6, does he offer his “preamble” </p>
<p>to the rest of the book (through chapter 20). In the present three chapters </p>
<p>he thus reminds his readers that no matter what may befall them, nor how </p>
<p>46. In this case their question echoes the sentiment, but not the precise language, </p>
<p>of Joel 2:11.</p>
