<p>Revelation 12:13–17</p>
<p>174</p>
<p>serpent’s reach. </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>en from his mouth the serpent spewed water </p>
<p>like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the </p>
<p>torrent. </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth </p>
<p>and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of its </p>
<p>mouth. </p>
<p>17</p>
<p>en the dragon was enraged at the woman and went </p>
<p>o to make war against the rest of her ospring—those who keep </p>
<p>God’s commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus.</p>
<p>is nal scene is the clear evidence that John is here picturing in apoc-</p>
<p>alyptic imagery not the future for God’s people newly formed through </p>
<p>“the blood of the Lamb,” but the twofold historical/theological reality </p>
<p>that the absolutely decisive event in the Holy War lies in the “recent” </p>
<p>past.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> At the same time, however, that decisive event, a constant re-</p>
<p>minder of the ultimate demise of “our ancient foe” predicated on the </p>
<p>resurrection itself, is also the present cause of his rage against God’s </p>
<p>people, who are a constant reminder of that defeat.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>In so doing John</p>
<p>is basically resigned to apocalyptic imagery altogether, since what is be-</p>
<p>ing pictured is a historical reality overlayed with other realities that lie </p>
<p>beyond merely “year and day.” John’s ultimate point lies with the nal </p>
<p>sentence (v. 17), which in turn serves as an introduction to the dramatic </p>
<p>images that follow in chapter 13 and spill over into chapter 14. But to </p>
<p>get there, he uses a number of images that are almost certainly intended </p>
<p>to be just that—images—and thus are not necessarily to be understood </p>
<p>as referring to specic historical or future events as such. What the rst </p>
<p>recipients are being told at this point is that their present suering at the </p>
<p>hands of the beast, as it will be pictured in the two scenes that follow </p>
<p>immediately (13:1–10 and 11–18), should not be a cause for surprise. If </p>
<p>in these coming two scenes their suering is portrayed in terms of the </p>
<p>Empire and emperor worship, here they are being told that what lies </p>
<p>behind it all is the dragon himself, Satan, and this as a direct response to </p>
<p>his being cast out of heaven, defeated through Christ’s death (at Satan’s </p>
<p>own hands) and subsequent resurrection (through God’s power).</p>
<p>is material, therefore, hardly falls into the category of “cause for </p>
<p>rejoicing.” Rather, here the seven churches are being oered the ulti-</p>
<p>15. One must be careful about using this kind of adjective in such moments, since </p>
<p>the seven decades or so since the crucixion/resurrection of Christ would be “recent” </p>
<p>only from our perspective, not theirs!</p>
<p>16. A reality that in my generation was depicted brilliantly by C. S. Lewis in e </p>
<p>Great Divorce.</p>
