<p>Revelation 1:12–16</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>is imagery, also used in 2:12, 16 and 19:15, 21, indicates that Christ </p>
<p>will speak words of both salvation and judgment, but especially of judg-</p>
<p>ment. And nally, Christ’s face was like the sun shining in all its bril-</p>
<p>liance, imagery that most likely anticipates the conclusion of the book </p>
<p>(21:11—22:5), where at the eschatological summation of all things the </p>
<p>sun is no longer needed for light because of the presence of God and </p>
<p>Christ.</p>
<p>Although it is dicult for many people in a verbal culture like </p>
<p>ours, having been raised on the sights and sounds of television, to visu-</p>
<p>alize this portrayal of Christ, for John’s readers it would most likely have </p>
<p>been readily available to their imaginations. Here stands the true high </p>
<p>priest—the heavenly one, Christ himself—and as such he has something </p>
<p>to say to the church, two generations aer his death and resurrection.</p>
<p>John’s Response and the Lord’s Command (1:17–20)</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. en he placed </p>
<p>his right hand on me and said: “Do not be afraid. I am the First </p>
<p>and the Last. </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, </p>
<p>I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and </p>
<p>Hades.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>“Write, therefore, what you have seen: both what is now </p>
<p>and what will take place later. </p>
<p>20</p>
<p>e mystery of the seven stars </p>
<p>that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands </p>
<p>is this: e seven stars are the angels</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>of the seven churches, and</p>
<p>the seven lampstands are the seven churches.”</p>
<p>e rest of the opening vision takes the form, rst, of response on </p>
<p>John’s part (v. 17a), followed by Christ’s own words of identication (vv. </p>
<p>17b–18) and his commissioning of John to write down what he sees for </p>
<p>the sake of the seven churches (v. 19), with a concluding interpretation </p>
<p>of the key elements of the vision itself (v. 20).</p>
<p>John, who is himself obviously in the vision, rst tells his read-</p>
<p>ers of his own response to such an encounter: when I saw him, I fell </p>
<p>at his feet as though dead. As with everything else to this point, this </p>
<p>too has its biblical roots, echoing Ezekiel’s response to his theophany in </p>
<p>1:28 (“when I saw it, I fell face down”). What John is describing is the </p>
<p>posture of obeisance, which is proper before a deity, but not before a </p>
<p>15. Or messengers</p>
