<p>To the Church in Laodicea</p>

<p>are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked. e rst two of these </p>
ve adjectives spell out the nature of their condition from the divine
<p>perspective: rather than not needing anything, their condition is rather </p>
<p>a kind of wretchedness that calls for pity. e nal three then spell out </p>
<p>their actual condition: the “rich” are in fact impoverished, neither able </p>
<p>to see nor clothed.</p>
e divine response to their own unrecognized wretchedness is
<p>to counsel them to buy from Christ what is necessary to become what </p>
<p>they think they are, but are not in fact. us Christ oers them gold re-</p>
<p>ned in the re, so you can become rich. is striking imagery, which </p>
<p>on the surface seems obvious, is in fact less than certain. ey would </p>
<p>surely, as will later readers, understand easily enough the imagery of </p>
<p>“gold rened in the re.” But what the imagery points to, or whether it </p>
<p>has any specic referent as such, is less than clear. Most likely the point </p>
<p>of the imagery lies not simply with the gold itself, but especially with </p>
<p>the fact that it needs to be “rened in the re.” If so, then their own need </p>
<p>to be “rened” as through re is the ultimate point of the imagery. At </p>
<p>the same time the imagery automatically points to something of great </p>
<p>value.</p>
<p>e white clothes to wear, which is the second curative category, </p>
<p>picks up the third of the preceding maladies. At the same time it takes </p>
<p>one back to the imagery used in the letter to the church in Sardis, al-</p>
<p>though the concern here is not so much with whiteness as such, but with </p>
<p>the use of the clothes: so you can cover your shameful nakedness. e </p>
<p>nal expression, “shameful nakedness,” carries some ambiguity as well. </p>
<p>Private nakedness is not to be thought of as shameful; what is shameful </p>
<p>rather is the public expression of the “nakedness” of this church, which </p>
<p>they of course cannot see, but which Christ sees clearly.</p>
<p>e third item they are to “buy” from Christ has to do with the </p>
<p>second malady in verse 17, their blindness. ey are to buy from me . . . </p>
<p>salve to put on your eyes, so you can see. Again, we are le a bit in the </p>
<p>dark as to the presupposition behind this imagery. But the “salve” is to </p>
<p>be understood as having curative properties to it, so that when applied </p>
<p>the “scales” drop o and the blind can see.</p>
<p>ese descriptions of this church’s impoverished condition and </p>
the corresponding divine cures are followed by two brief sentences
<p>that essentially have Laodicean repentance as their goal. First, the One </p>
<p>described as “the faithful and true witness” (v. 14) arms that those I </p>
