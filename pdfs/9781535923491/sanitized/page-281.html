<p>e Fall of Babylon the Great</p>

<p>“Rejoice over her, you heavens!</p>
<p>Rejoice, you people of God;</p>
<p>Rejoice, apostles and prophets!</p>
<p>For God has judged her with the judgment she imposed on you.”</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>en a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large mill-</p>
<p>stone and threw it into the sea, and said:</p>
<p>“With such violence</p>
<p>the great city of Babylon will be thrown down,</p>
<p>never to be found again. </p>
<p>22</p>
<p>e music of harpists and musicians, pipers and trumpeters,</p>
<p>will never be heard in you again.</p>
<p>No worker of any trade</p>
<p>will ever be found in you again.</p>
<p>e sound of a millstone</p>
<p>will never be heard in you again.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>e light of a lamp</p>
<p>will never shine in you again.</p>
<p>e voice of bridegroom and bride</p>
<p>will never be heard in you again.</p>

<p>the threefold set of “woes” is both sudden and therefore momentarily </p>
<p>startling. How does one rejoice over such a tragic ending? e answer, </p>
<p>of course, lies with the repetition of the lex taliones (“an eye for an eye”) </p>
<p>called for by the voice from heaven in verses 6–7a. Now at the end of </p>
<p>the threefold woes the heavenly voice responds with a threefold call to </p>
<p>rejoice, thus reecting the essence of Jeremiah 51:48 (“en heaven and </p>
<p>earth and all that is in them will shout for joy over Babylon”).</p>
<p>e call, which grammatically must still be that of the unidentied </p>
<p>speaker in verse 4, comes in descending order, not of importance, but of </p>
<p>the size of the group. First up, and with the full clause: Rejoice over her, </p>
<p>you heavens!, thus reecting back to the host of heaven rst seen in </p>
<p>5:11 and appearing again in 7:11–12. en, singled out are “the saints,” </p>
<p>regularly and correctly rendered people of God in the NIV, referring </p>
