<p>e Dramatis Personae: John’s Vision of Christ</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>images, John describes his array as that of Israel’s chief priests: he was </p>
<p>dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash </p>
<p>around his waist. In so doing, John is deliberately borrowing language </p>
<p>from the Septuagint, where it is used exclusively for the full-length tu-</p>
<p>nic of the high priest; thus his readers would readily understand that </p>
<p>Jesus, the “son of man,” is also being presented as the great high priest.</p>
<p>As to the particulars, the hair on his head is described as white </p>
<p>like wool, as white as snow, language taken directly from Daniel 7:9, </p>
<p>where it describes the Ancient of Days. us, as in the Gospel that bears </p>
his name, John has no diculty portraying Christ as divine. e imag-
<p>ery in this case is probably intended to picture absolute purity. Christ’s </p>
<p>eyes were like blazing re, language now borrowed from Daniel 10:6, </p>
<p>most likely intending to portray him with eyes that are penetrating and </p>
<p>all-seeing. e imagery of the feet . . . like bronze glowing in a furnace </p>
<p>is also taken from Daniel 10:6, but with some slight modications. John </p>
<p>thus presents Christ with imagery that stands in sharp contrast to that </p>
<p>in Daniel 2, which had feet consisting of a mix of clay and iron. Here </p>
<p>the picture is of someone absolutely sturdy and unable to be tarnished, </p>
<p>and thus not subject to decay or falsehood.</p>
<p>Christ’s voice is likened to the sound of rushing waters, language </p>
<p>borrowed from the description of God in Ezekiel 1:24. e picture is </p>
<p>that of conuent streams noisily joining and rushing seaward. John </p>
<p>next pictures Christ’s right hand as holding seven stars, imagery that </p>
<p>no longer describes Christ’s “appearance” as such, and which is also </p>
<p>expressed without the “like” comparison of the previous ones. is im-</p>
<p>agery in fact has no Old Testament background, but did have a long </p>
<p>history in astrological mythology (since most ancients believed that hu-</p>
<p>man life was inuenced by the seven planets). John has thus co-opted </p>
<p>pagan imagery and will give it a Christian point of reference—as the </p>
<p>“angels” of the seven churches. eir relationship to Jesus lies with their </p>
<p>being held by him “in his right hand,” the place of authority.</p>
<p>e most signicant features, his mouth and his face, are described </p>
<p>at the conclusion. In many ways the mouth is the most signicant fea-</p>
<p>ture, since what follows concerning the churches is all spoken by Christ </p>
<p>himself. As with that of his right hand, the description of his mouth has </p>
<p>to do with what is related to it. us, in this case echoing Isaiah 49:2 </p>
<p>(where the mouth of God’s servant has been made like a sharpened </p>
<p>sword), coming out of his mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword. </p>
