<p>Preface</p>
<p>Stepping into the Revelation from the rest of the New Testament is to </p>
<p>enter into a strange, bizarre new world; and this is true even in the days </p>
<p>of Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. Instead of narratives, arguments, </p>
<p>or plain statements of fact, the Revelation is full of angels, trumpets, </p>
<p>and earthquakes; of strange beasts, dragons, and bottomless pits. Most </p>
<p>believers, therefore, take one of two extremes: some simply avoid it in </p>
<p>despair; others take an exaggerated interest in it, thinking to nd here </p>
<p>all the keys to the end of the world.</p>
<p>Both of these positions, I would argue, are simply wrong. On the </p>
<p>one hand, in the providence of God it is Holy Scripture, a part of the </p>
<p>twenty-seven-document canon of the New Testament. Indeed, it serves </p>
<p>as the ultimate—and marvelous—conclusion to the whole of Scripture. </p>
<p>On the other hand, a great deal of what has been written about it, es-</p>
<p>pecially at the popular level, tends to obscure its meaning rather than </p>
<p>to help the reader understand it. In fact many years ago, when I was </p>
<p>teaching a course on the Revelation at Wheaton College, one of the op-</p>
<p>tions for a term paper was to analyze the exegesis of Hal Lindsay’s e </p>
<p>Late Great Planet Earth. Two students took me up on this alternative, </p>
<p>both of whom independently came to the conclusion that the task was </p>
<p>altogether impossible, since there is not a single exegetical moment in </p>
<p>Lindsay’s entire book. John himself would surely have found Lindsay’s </p>
<p>book as “apocalyptic” as most modern readers do John’s.</p>
<p>e purpose of the present book is therefore singular: to oer one </p>
<p>New Testament scholar’s exegetical reading of the text, with very little </p>
<p>concern for anything except to help people hear it for the word of God </p>
<p>that it is. And therefore none of the so-called alternative ways of un-</p>
<p>derstanding the book will hereaer be mentioned in this book. At the </p>
<p>same time, I would be deceiving the reader if I did not admit that I am </p>
<p>equally concerned that the exegesis leads to theological understanding. </p>
<p>at is, what does it mean for God and his Christ to be the one and only </p>
<p>sovereign(s) in a universe in which others compete for sovereignty and </p>
