<p>RE V ELATION 19 :11—20 :15</p>
<p>The Last Battle and the End of Evil</p>
<p>Although scholars generally recognize the various pieces of the sections </p>
<p>that bring John’s grand narrative to its conclusion, not all are agreed as </p>
<p>to how these various parts are related to one another and thus to the ar-</p>
<p>gument as a whole. Some in fact seem to miss the ow of the argument </p>
<p>altogether,</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>especially the role of the much-abused word of comfort to</p>
<p>the martyrs in 20:1–6. is is in large part the result of their being mis-</p>
<p>led by the numbering system noted above, which is helpful for nding </p>
<p>things, but in this case has played a rather disastrous role in misleading </p>
<p>the reader in terms of understanding what is going on. Primarily on the </p>
<p>basis of content, but also in part to help the reader see the actual role </p>
<p>that the much abused material in 20:1–6 plays in the narrative, I have </p>
<p>chosen to look at it in the context of the narratives that surround it, the </p>
<p>Last Battle (19:11–21) and the judgment of Satan (20:7–10).</p>
<p>Part of the reason for this is to help the reader see the place that </p>
<p>the well-known (so-called) millennium (20:4b–5) has in the narrative, </p>
<p>since a “millennium” as such is so incidental not only to the story as a </p>
<p>whole, but even to the paragraph in which the language “a thousand </p>
<p>years” occurs. Indeed, were the numbers and interlude not there, the </p>
<p>reader could hardly miss the close connection John intended between </p>
<p>the two concluding sections that surround it, which together bring clo-</p>
<p>sure to the story of evil that has called forth so much of John’s narrative. </p>
<p>In any case, the true wrap-up of the narrative begins with the Last Battle </p>
<p>(19:11–21), which is followed aer the interlude by a set of concluding </p>
<p>judgments, rst on the Evil One (20:7–10) and then on those who have </p>
<p>followed him (20:11–15). And it is only aer these judgments are meted </p>
<p>out that the nal chapter of “God’s story,” which includes God’s people </p>
<p>who are true to him, is brought to its eschatological conclusion.</p>
<p>1. is is due in part to the unfortunate verse numbering in the nal several chap-</p>
<p>ters, noted above (p. 244 n. 8) in the preceding section.</p>
