<p>Rome as a Seductive Harlot</p>
<p>241</p>
<p>burn her with re. </p>
<p>17</p>
<p>For God has put it into their hearts to ac-</p>
<p>complish his purpose by agreeing to hand over to the beast their </p>
<p>royal authority, until God’s words are fullled. </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>e woman you </p>
<p>saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.”</p>
<p>For a second time in the narrative John reminds his readers that what is </p>
<p>being presented here comes by way of angelic interpretation, not simply </p>
<p>by way of John’s own “seeing.” Indeed, in this concluding paragraph the </p>
<p>angel three times picks up on what John “saw” (vv. 15, 16, 18). What </p>
<p>follows, then, is the second instance in the present narrative (along with </p>
<p>v. 7) in which the angel steps on the scene and said to me. e inter-</p>
<p>pretation itself, interestingly enough, goes back beyond the description </p>
<p>of the harlot in verse 3 to the angelic announcement in verse 2, thus </p>
<p>to the waters you saw rather than to the desert where John had been </p>
<p>taken so as to see this vision. Indeed, the interpreting angel takes John </p>
<p>back to the opening description in verse 1 and explains “the waters” as </p>
<p>a symbol for peoples, multitudes, nations and languages. is is now </p>
<p>the seventh and nal such listing in the book, whose unique feature in </p>
<p>this case is the substitution of “multitudes” for “tribes.”</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>John’s obvious</p>
<p>rst point is that Rome sits astraddle almost all the peoples in Europe </p>
<p>and North Africa, and there functions as a prostitute by whom all of </p>
<p>them have been seduced.</p>
<p>What follows, however, are not further identications, but rather </p>
<p>a further explanation as to the future of “the prostitute.” And even </p>
<p>though not everything said here is immediately clear, the overall point </p>
<p>can scarcely be missed. ose who have been subordinate to her, the </p>
<p>beast and the ten horns you saw, who have largely beneted from her </p>
<p>adulteries, will eventually hate the prostitute and be the cause of bring-</p>
<p>ing her down. us, and again borrowing language from the Prophets, </p>
<p>eventually they will bring her to ruin and leave her naked,</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> twin im-</p>
<p>ages that depict Rome’s ultimate defeat and her nal shame. e con-</p>
<p>cluding graphic expression of this hatred takes the form of eating her </p>
<p>esh and burning her with re.</p>
<p>6. For the comparative presentation of all these lists, see p. 85, n. 24; see esp. the </p>
<p>list in 10:11, where also the word “tribe(s)” had a substitute word, “kingdoms” in that </p>
<p>case.</p>
<p>7. For this imagery see Ezek 16:39, in the appalling picture of Israel’s abandoning </p>
<p>the God who rescued her for a life of adultery (=idolatry).</p>
