<p>Revelation 12:7–12</p>
<p>170</p>
<p>especially proud foreign kings. us Isaiah announces the fall of the </p>
<p>king of Babylon (14:12–15):</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>How you have fallen from heaven,</p>
<p> morning star, son of the dawn!</p>
<p> You have been cast down to the earth,</p>
<p> you who once laid low the nations!</p>
<p>You said in your heart,</p>
<p> “I will ascend to heaven;</p>
<p> I will raise my throne</p>
<p> above the stars of God;</p>
<p> . . . .</p>
<p> I will make myself like the Most High.</p>
<p>is view of things was further armed by Jesus when the seventy-two </p>
<p>disciples returned with their glowing acclamation that “even the de-</p>
<p>mons submit to us in your name,” to which he replied, “I saw Satan fall </p>
<p>like lightning from heaven” (Luke 10:17–18). What this means nally </p>
<p>for John’s readers will be picked up in the nal paragraph of the chapter </p>
<p>(vv. 13–17). But before he goes there John interrupts the narrative with </p>
<p>a song, sung by a loud voice in heaven, whose purpose is to reinforce </p>
<p>the reality of his readers’ present existence as they live in the tension </p>
<p>of the “already but not yet.” So while it is true that Satan will pursue </p>
<p>the Lamb’s people because they constantly remind him of his ultimate </p>
<p>defeat through the death and resurrection of the Messiah, he will not </p>
<p>be able to conquer them even though he will slaughter many of them. </p>
<p>us, in a song of three parts, John reminds his audience, rst (v. 10), </p>
<p>that Christ’s death and resurrection (even though not mentioned di-</p>
<p>rectly) have led to the expulsion of Satan from heaven; second (v. 11), </p>
<p>that their own victory over Satan in the present is the combined result </p>
<p>of Christ’s death and their own witness to it by word and eventually </p>
<p>(for many) by martyrdom; and nally (v. 12), that while heaven rejoices </p>
<p>over Satan’s defeat, God’s people on earth are about to experience the </p>
<p>full fury of Satan’s wrath.</p>
<p>e song thus begins with an acclamation of triumph, echoing </p>
<p>the heavenly song at the sounding of the seventh trumpet (11:15), and </p>
<p>exclaiming the “already” of the kingdom in terms of both the Father </p>
<p>9. Cf. the similar (although not poetic) oracle against the king of Tyre in Ezek </p>
<p>26:12–19.</p>
