<p>To the Church in Sardis</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>On the one hand, its history went way back, as far as—or further </p>
<p>than—ancient Troy to the north. Its location determined everything. It </p>
<p>was situated y miles east-northeast of Ephesus, positioned on a huge </p>
<p>promontory that jutted out from a mountain range at the south end of </p>
<p>a large and very fertile valley. ere it sat 1500 feet above the oor of </p>
<p>the valley, barely connected to the mountain range, and with sheer clis </p>
<p>on all other sides. Because of its strategic—and nearly impregnable—</p>
<p>location, Sardis had had a long, continuous history of prosperity, and </p>
<p>of some importance. Indeed, by the time of the Revelation, the city was </p>
<p>still so, aer centuries of existence—illustrated by the fact that when it </p>
<p>was devastated by a famous earthquake in 17 CE,</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>it was rebuilt by the</p>
<p>emperor himself, and then only nine years later it competed with ten </p>
<p>other cities as the site for an imperial temple.</p>
<p>On the other hand, that same location and history gave the city a </p>
<p>sense of invincibility, and of signicance as a major player on the big-</p>
<p>ger scene, that far outstripped the actual facts of its history. So much </p>
<p>was this so that the Sardians lived something of an illusion as to their </p>
<p>security and their real signicance. For example, their apparent invin-</p>
<p>cibility, to which the satirist Lucian still alludes in the second century </p>
<p>(comparing the taking of Sardis to an impossible undertaking) was not </p>
<p>altogether true historically. In actual fact, they had been conquered </p>
<p>twice: by Cyrus of Persia (6th c. BCE), who had captured Croesus him-</p>
<p>self; and by Antiochus the Great (3rd c. BCE). In both cases, the cap-</p>
<p>ture was brought o by some who scaled its clis at points considered </p>
<p>impregnable.</p>
<p>Since all of this was well known, and was mentioned in a variety </p>
<p>of ways in ancient literature, it is unlikely that the church could have </p>
<p>missed the direct allusion to these events, when Christ says to them that </p>
<p>he will come upon them as a thief. Furthermore, the city’s own sense of </p>
<p>signicance was more illusory than real; so, for example, in their bid for </p>
<p>the imperial temple, they foolishly based their appeal almost altogether </p>
<p>on their illustrious past as making them deserving of this favor. As a </p>
<p>result, they lost the bid to Smyrna, whose appeal was based on current </p>
<p>signicance.</p>
<p>e evidence of this letter suggests that the church itself had taken </p>
<p>on some of the characteristics of the city. us the letter is primarily a </p>
<p>18. Which Pliny, some forty years later, called “the greatest disaster in human </p>
<p>memory.”</p>
