<p>his image. One should note here how closely tied together John once </p>
<p>more saw “receiving the mark of the beast” with the cult of the emperor. </p>
<p>Most likely, people “worshiped” the “image of the beast” by oering </p>
<p>some form of religious devotion at the shrine of the emperor. But for </p>
<p>John the time for their deluding people would be brought to a decisive </p>
<p>end, as the two of them (the beast and false prophet) were thrown alive </p>
<p>into the ery lake of burning sulfur. But this fate was not for all those </p>
<p>who opposed God and the Lamb; the rest, meaning “the kings of the </p>
<p>earth and their armies,” were killed with the sword, the same one noted </p>
<p>earlier as coming out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and so </p>
<p>they became the ultimate meal for the vultures. us John concludes by </p>
<p>noting that all the birds gorged themselves on their esh. And with </p>
<p>that gruesome picture the basic story of God’s judgment of the Empire </p>
<p>comes to an end.</p>
<p>What remains to be told is the judgment of Satan himself (20:7–</p>
<p>10) and the nal judgment of all who have died prior to the coming of </p>
<p>Christ (20:11–15). But that story must wait, because John is compelled </p>
<p>to remind his current readers that the present “war” is not over, and that </p>
there will be many more martyrs before God brings the story to divine
<p>conclusion. us he presents yet another interlude vision, intended to </p>
<p>oer those already martyred and yet to be martyred that God has not </p>
<p>only not forgotten them, but that they have a special place in God’s </p>
<p>overall design.</p>

<p>And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key </p>
<p>to the Abyss and holding in his hand a great chain. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>He seized </p>
<p>the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and </p>
<p>bound him for a thousand years. 3He threw him into the Abyss, </p>
<p>and locked and sealed it over him, to keep him from deceiving the </p>
<p>nations anymore until the thousand years were ended. Aer that, </p>
<p>he must be set free for a short time.</p>

<p>I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been </p>
<p>given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had </p>
<p>been beheaded because they held to the testimony about Jesus and </p>
<p>because of the word of God. ey had not worshiped the beast or </p>
<p>his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or </p>
