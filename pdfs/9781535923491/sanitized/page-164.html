<p>Revelation 10:1–11</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>peated (otherwise quite unnecessarily so) two more times (in vv. 5 and </p>
<p>8, in both cases where the scene shis to the next episode), one must </p>
<p>assume that such repetition indicates a measure of signicance. Most </p>
<p>likely it anticipates the visions of the two beasts in 13:1 and 11, where </p>
<p>one comes up out of the sea and the other comes out of the earth. is </p>
<p>seems to be made certain by the sworn oath in the present vision (v. 6), </p>
<p>where the emphasis lies on God as the creator (and thus ruler) of both </p>
<p>the land and the sea. Despite the ravages of the two beasts, therefore, </p>
<p>this angel by way of anticipation reminds the reader that both land and </p>
<p>sea belong to God, not to the Empire.</p>
<p>at this is John’s intent seems veried by the further elaboration </p>
<p>of the scene in verse 3, where the angel gave a loud shout like the roar </p>
<p>of a lion. Here John is deliberately using language from both Hosea </p>
<p>and Amos, where Yahweh himself “roars like a lion” (Hos 11:10; cf. </p>
<p>Amos 1:2; 3:8; Jer 25:30). Now it is the angel who has “come down from </p>
<p>heaven” whose “shout” sounds “like the roar of a lion,” which in turn </p>
<p>caused the voices of the seven thunders to speak. ese personied </p>
<p>“thunders,” even though they are introduced with the denite article, </p>
<p>are otherwise unknown in all of Jewish or Christian apocalyptic litera-</p>
<p>ture; and further speculation is of very little value.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>What John seems</p>
<p>to be doing is deliberately building up the drama of the scene for the </p>
<p>sake of his readers. In any case the present scene is not the main event </p>
<p>itself; it is merely setting up what follows. is is nally made clear in </p>
<p>verse 4, which concludes the opening paragraph with a command to </p>
<p>John himself, who was about to write . . . when the seven thunders </p>
<p>spoke, but who was commanded instead by a voice from heaven to </p>
<p>seal up what the seven thunders have said</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>and do not write it down.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, despite this very clear command to John, many later inter-</p>
<p>preters have not been satised with silence and have thus disobeyed the </p>
<p>“voice from heaven” by speculating about what “the seven thunders . . . </p>
<p>said.” Such attempts in fact play havoc with the biblical text itself, since </p>
<p>the intent here is mystery and awe, not information.</p>
<p>21. e closest analogy to it is the personication of “thunder” in Ps 29:3–5, where </p>
<p>“the God of glory thunders, . . . the voice of Yahweh is powerful; the voice of Yahweh </p>
<p>is majestic.”</p>
<p>22. is appears to be an echo of Dan 8:26: “but seal up the vision, for it concerns </p>
<p>the distant future.”</p>
