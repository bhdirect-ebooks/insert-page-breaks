<p>Revelation 13:1–18</p>
<p>184</p>
<p>disclosed. What he has oered is not simply a prophetic word about </p>
<p>the satanic nature of Rome and its emperors, but also a clear warning </p>
<p>to God’s people regarding what is to come for them: captivity and/or </p>
<p>execution. It is therefore not surprising that he should conclude with </p>
<p>yet another call for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of </p>
<p>God’s people. And it is of further interest to point out that John’s word </p>
<p>order puts up front what is most needed in the coming crisis: “patient </p>
<p>endurance,” which in turn will be in evidence through their “faithful-</p>
<p>ness” to Christ and his people.</p>
<p>e Beast out of the Earth (13:11–18)</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>en I saw a second beast, coming out of the earth. It had two </p>
<p>horns like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon. </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>It exercised all the </p>
<p>authority of the rst beast on its behalf, and made the earth and </p>
<p>its inhabitants worship the rst beast, whose fatal wound had been </p>
<p>healed. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>And it performed great signs, even causing re to come </p>
<p>down from heaven to earth in full view of everyone. </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Because of </p>
<p>the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the rst beast, </p>
<p>it deceived the inhabitants of the earth. It ordered them to set up </p>
<p>an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword </p>
<p>and yet lived. </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>e second beast was given power to give breath </p>
<p>to the image of the rst beast, so that the image could speak and </p>
<p>cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. </p>
<p>16</p>
<p>It also </p>
<p>forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, </p>
<p>to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, </p>
<p>17</p>
<p>so </p>
<p>that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is </p>
<p>the name of the beast or the number of its name.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>is calls for wisdom. Let those who have insight calculate </p>
<p>the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man.a at num-</p>
<p>ber is 666.</p>
<p>With this paragraph John moves on from the Empire and its emperors </p>
<p>to the cult of the emperor that was originally intended as less of a reli-</p>
<p>gious phenomenon than as a way of bringing cohesion to the disparate </p>
<p>parts of the Empire. Worship the emperor as a kind of deity and one </p>
<p>must allow him to do almost anything he wishes. It is in fact highly </p>
<p>unlikely that the emperor who was (ultimately) responsible for John’s </p>
<p>exile took himself seriously as a god; nonetheless he was quite willing to </p>
<p>have temples built in his honor and thus for the cult of the emperor to </p>
ourish. Aer all, such “divinity” was to his great advantage. us John
