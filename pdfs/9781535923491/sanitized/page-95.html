<p>e Occupants of Heaven and eir Worship</p>

<p>they cease altogether to be any recognizable land animal. Indeed, it is </p>
<p>not easy to determine what John understood by this unique feature in </p>
<p>his vision of heaven. Most likely the collage was intentional so that the </p>
<p>whole of creation—all living beings, as it were—is seen in heaven as </p>
<p>joining in the worship of “him who sits on the throne.”</p>
<p>e content of their worship is itself another marvelous Johannine </p>
<p>collage, in this case of Isaiah 6:3 and John’s own descriptor of the eternal </p>
<p>nature of God found above in 1:4. us, using the language of Isaiah, </p>
<p>the four living beings never stop saying, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord </p>
<p>God Almighty.” But in place of Isaiah’s concluding clause, “the whole </p>
<p>earth is full of his glory,” which has to do with the earth itself, in the </p>
<p>present heavenly scene the (apparently representative) creatures go on </p>
<p>to arm God the Father as the one who was, and is, and is to come. </p>
<p>Noticeably, and undoubtedly purposefully, the order now is not, as in </p>
<p>1:4, present–past–future, but past–present–future. ere is probably </p>
<p>no intentional signicance to this change; rather it now expresses the </p>
<p>same reality in terms of our time-bound existence, whereas in the rst </p>
<p>instance it was expressed in terms of God’s own eternal existence.</p>
<p>In the rest of this initial heavenly scene John describes the response </p>
<p>of the twenty-four elders, all of which is presented in a simple chias-</p>
<p>tic manner. Although it is all about the “throne in heaven” and “him </p>
<p>who sits on” it, John does this by describing two categories of beings, </p>
<p>one earthly (the twenty-four elders) and one heavenly (the four living </p>
<p>creatures), who now in reverse order are described not in terms of who </p>
<p>they are or what they do, but only in terms of their worship. us the </p>
<p>worship of the second group, the four living creatures, oers praise to </p>
<p>God in terms of God’s character (“holy”), power (“the Almighty”), and </p>
<p>uncreated, eternal nature (“who was and is and is to come”)—God the </p>
<p>Eternal One. When John returns to the praise oered by the twenty-</p>
<p>four elders (v. 11), it has altogether to do with God as Creator of all </p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>e language John uses for this praise oered by the four living </p>
<p>creatures takes the form of giving glory, honor and thanks to him who </p>
<p>sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever. Although these </p>
<p>three forms of worship (glory, honor, thanksgiving) have a very biblical </p>
<p>ring to them, and thus can be easily blended into one, the three verbs </p>
<p>in fact represent three dierent expressions of devotion that creatures </p>
<p>oer to their Creator, who is once more identied as enthroned and </p>
