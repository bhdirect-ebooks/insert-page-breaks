<p>To the Church in Sardis</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>interceding for Israel by saying, “Whoever has sinned against me I will </p>
<p>blot out of my book,” a concept that in Psalm 69:28 is referred to as “the </p>
<p>book of life.” is language is then picked up by Paul in Philippians </p>
<p>4:3, as well as here and later in the Revelation. us the names of the </p>
<p>believers in Sardis are enrolled on the heavenly citizenship roster, and </p>
<p>because of this at the nal procession of Christ and his saints they will </p>
<p>walk with him in white (cf. 19:14).</p>
<p>e nal part of the promise is equally compelling, where Christ’s </p>
<p>promise to the victors is that I will acknowledge their names before </p>
<p>my Father and his angels. Given the signicance of naming in the an-</p>
<p>cient world, this would most likely have been seen as the ultimate kudo. </p>
<p>us, not only will their names not be blotted out, but at the Eschaton </p>
<p>the Savior will acknowledge them by name before God the Father and </p>
<p>the entire heavenly host. One can only hope that this kind of promise, </p>
<p>following the censure in verse 2 (having a reputation for being alive, but </p>
<p>being actually dead) and the warnings in verse 3, would have caused </p>
<p>the whole community indeed to “wake up,” so as to have their names </p>
<p>acknowledged by the Son before the Father.</p>
<p>To the Church in Philadelphia (3:7–13)</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>“To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write:</p>
<p>ese are the words of him who is holy and true, who holds the </p>
<p>key of David. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts </p>
<p>no one can open. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>I know your deeds. See, I have placed before </p>
<p>you an open door that no one can shut. I know that you have </p>
<p>little strength, yet you have kept my word and have not denied </p>
<p>my name. </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, </p>
<p>who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars—I will </p>
<p>make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that </p>
<p>I have loved you. </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Since you have kept my command to endure </p>
<p>patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to </p>
<p>come upon the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have, so that no one </p>
<p>will take your crown. </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>ose who are victorious I will make pil-</p>
<p>lars in the temple of my God. Never again will they leave it. I will </p>
<p>write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my </p>
<p>God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from </p>
<p>my God; and I will also write on them my new name. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Whoever </p>
<p>has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</p>
