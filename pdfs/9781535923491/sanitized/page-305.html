<p>e Last Battle: An Interlude</p>
<p>283</p>
<p>erything between these two clauses indicates where John’s real interest </p>
<p>in them lies, namely, with the fact that they had been beheaded, and </p>
<p>the twofold reason for it.</p>
<p>First, returning to language with which the book began, John </p>
<p>again describes the martyrs as those who held to the testimony about </p>
<p>Jesus. us with this language John notes their relationship to himself. </p>
<p>Whereas he is currently in exile for the same reason (see on 1:2), John </p>
<p>here pictures those who will “reign with Christ” during the “thousand </p>
<p>years” as having been martyred for their “testimony” and also because </p>
<p>of the word of God. While this makes for easy reading, it does not </p>
<p>necessarily lead to immediate understanding. at is, “the testimony </p>
<p>about Jesus” seems easy enough, but what did John intend further by </p>
<p>the phrase, “because of the word of God,” since this rather ubiquitous </p>
<p>“of” phrase can mean either a word from God or a word about God? As </p>
<p>suggested in the discussion of the phrase in 1:2, in this book John al-</p>
<p>most certainly intends the former. But at this point in the narrative the </p>
<p>immediate signicance of this language lies with the rest of the descrip-</p>
<p>tion, which takes the reader back to the narrative in chapter 13: they </p>
<p>had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received his </p>
<p>mark on their foreheads or their hands. us with these two clauses </p>
<p>John ties together the basic concerns in the preceding narrative, their </p>
<p>adherence to Christ and his gospel, and thus their refusal to join in </p>
<p>emperor worship.</p>
<p>What follows, therefore, is further explanation for the sake of the </p>
<p>reader that John has been dealing only with the martyrs up to this point. </p>
<p>us he goes on to explain that the real resurrection, that of the rest </p>
<p>of the dead, will not take place (they did not come to life) until the </p>
<p>thousand years were ended, which he concludes with yet a further ex-</p>
<p>planation that this is the rst resurrection. e passage then concludes </p>
<p>with a beatitude: Blessed and holy are those who have part in the rst </p>
<p>resurrection. is ts the concern of the passage easily enough, but in </p>
<p>light of the further explanation of the “rst resurrection” in 20:14 and </p>
<p>21:8, one is not quite sure of John’s overall intent by including here that </p>
<p>the second death</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>has no power over them, since one might expect</p>
<p>their escaping this to be their special provision. But as it turns out, ac-</p>
<p>12. For the rst mention of the “second death” see 2:16.</p>
