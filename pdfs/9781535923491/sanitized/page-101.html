<p>e Lion Who Is a Lamb</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>and the elders. e Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes, which </p>
<p>are the seven spirits</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> of God sent out into all the earth.</p>
<p>is next scene is especially high drama. As John weeps because of </p>
<p>what is perceived as an unresolved tension between a scroll that needs </p>
<p>to be opened and no one worthy to do so, one of the elders noted in the </p>
<p>preceding narrative tells John, do not weep! is is then followed by the </p>
<p>imperative “look!” (see in the NIV and NRSV),</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>which as part of the</p>
<p>drama calls John’s attention to what he has not yet seen, but will imme-</p>
<p>diately. First, however, the reasons that he should not weep are given; </p>
<p>and here John’s own partiality toward biblical imagery takes over.</p>
<p>e one John is about to see is rst of all described in messianic </p>
<p>language from the Old Testament. With the verb has triumphed sitting </p>
<p>in the emphatic rst position, the conqueror is then described as the </p>
<p>Lion of the tribe of Judah. is language is derived from Jacob’s bless-</p>
<p>ing of his sons in Genesis 49, where in verse 9 Judah is called “a lion’s </p>
<p>cub,” and in verse 10 Jacob prophesies that “the scepter will not depart </p>
<p>from Judah.” e second title, which stands in apposition to the rst, </p>
<p>describes Christ as the Root of David. Although this term does not </p>
<p>appear in the Old Testament in precisely this way, it is best understood </p>
<p>as an updating of the appellation regarding the Messiah in Isaiah 11:10 </p>
<p>(cf. v. 1), where he is described as “the Root of Jesse.” Here Jesse’s son </p>
<p>David has been (rightly) substituted for the name of the father.</p>
<p>John’s sentence then concludes with an innitive to open, which </p>
<p>has apparently (and rightly) been understood by the NIV translators as </p>
<p>a result clause. us he has triumphed, so that he is able to open the </p>
<p>scroll and its seven seals. By putting what occurs next in his narrative </p>
<p>in reverse order in this introductory clause, John indicates where his </p>
<p>emphasis ultimately lies—with the opening of the seventh seal. is </p>
<p>nally occurs in 8:1 and following, where at last the scroll is opened, </p>
<p>while its contents are then spelled out in the rest of the book.</p>
<p>In response to the command to “look,” John proceeds next to de-</p>
<p>scribe the absolutely central feature of what he saw; and in so doing </p>
<p>he presents us with one of the great moments in Christian theology. </p>
<p>13. at is, the sevenfold Spirit</p>
<p>14. is imperative has been le out of many modern English versions (NEB, REB, </p>
<p>NAB), including the NASU, but has been kept in the NASB. e imperative in this case </p>
<p>is best understood as part of the drama, and therefore should be kept, even though for </p>
<p>meaning as such it is unnecessary at this point.</p>
