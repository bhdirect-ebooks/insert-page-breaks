<p>appears to be earthly (“standing on Mount Zion”), but in fact all the rest </p>
<p>of it is heavenly, and there has been no movement of John himself since </p>
<p>his arrival in heaven at the beginning of chapter 4. At the same time one </p>
<p>must also deal with the mixing of temporal and spatial images as well, </p>
<p>since in verse 2 the “sound comes from heaven,” yet in verse 3 those </p>
<p>singing are “before the throne.”</p>
<p>at John is still in heaven even in verse 1 is made certain by the </p>
<p>fact that the reader is immediately confronted by the Lamb (from ch. </p>
<p>5) and “God and the Lamb” (v. 4, echoing chs. 4–5 ), and then by the </p>
<p>144,000 (echoing ch. 7),who are singing a new song before the heavenly </p>
<p>entourage (again echoing ch. 5) and who are noted as “having been </p>
<p>purchased from among the human race” (ch. 5). What is new, and what </p>
<p>gives a new twist to the narrative, is that they are now “on Mount Zion,” </p>
<p>and are identied as not having broken the seventh and ninth com-</p>
<p>mandments (against adultery and false witness).</p>
<p>e new scene begins yet again with the phrase then I looked, </p>
<p>which not only places John still in the heavenly scene, but also continues </p>
<p>the narrative from chapter 12 without a break in “geography,” but rather </p>
<p>only in the considerable variety of the various pictures themselves. In </p>
<p>keeping with John’s overall concerns, the rst thing noted is that there </p>
<p>before me was the Lamb, who had had a central role at the beginning </p>
<p>of the narrative with which this part of the story began (12:11), and </p>
<p>who was also featured, although more indirectly, in the preceding nar-</p>
<p>rative about the Empire (13:8). e surprising feature is that he is seen </p>
<p>standing on Mount Zion, which in this case can be understood only in </p>
<p>a gurative sense; at issue is what gurative sense, since this term recurs </p>
<p>throughout the Old Testament and therefore is not easy to pin down, </p>
<p>although most oen is a symbolic way of speaking about Jerusalem. </p>
<p>Most likely John is here, as with the author of Hebrews, using earthly </p>
<p>imagery to depict the heavenly expression of “the Holy City, Jerusalem” </p>
<p>(Hebrews 12:22), which later in the book he sees as coming down out </p>
<p>of heaven from God (21:10).</p>
<p>Also standing with him (the Lamb) were 144,000 who had his </p>
<p>name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads. is very </p>
<p>intentional symbolism seems to strike several chords at once. First, the </p>
<p>numerical reference takes one back to the narrative in 7:4–8, where this </p>
<p>(probably same) group is rst introduced as those who will experience </p>
<p>great “tribulation” at the hands of God’s enemies (7:14). Although John </p>
