<p>e Two Beasts</p>
<p>187</p>
<p>Finally, to make sure that his readers cannot mistake who the beast </p>
<p>represents at this point, John tells them that even though it is the num-</p>
<p>ber of the beast . . . it is also the number of a man. He then gives the </p>
<p>number as 666, a number that seems designed to point to Nero Caesar, </p>
<p>using Hebrew numbers. And if one cannot be sure about the latter, one </p>
<p>can be absolutely sure of the nal implication of this numbering for </p>
<p>John’s readers: that they would be excluded from all ordinary human </p>
<p>intercourse if they did not play the emperor’s game. Hence John’s nal </p>
<p>sentence reminds them that this calls for wisdom, since whatever else </p>
<p>may be in store for them—especially in light of the special place the </p>
<p>number seven plays in the biblical economy—the number that the rest </p>
<p>of the world will have to own is the number of a man, a designation that </p>
in this case is intended to mark him o as merely human, not divine,
<p>whatever bold claims some of the emperors were inclined to make.</p>
<p>We should perhaps conclude this section by noting that whether </p>
<p>intended by John or not—and it is more likely he did—the net result of </p>
<p>this passage is a kind of “unholy trinity” that will be found again in the </p>
<p>Final Battle in chapters 19–20, where the two beasts—there called the </p>
<p>beast and the false prophet (from 16:13)—and Satan are cast into the </p>
<p>lake of re and sulfur. us the dragon, Satan, is a perverse reection </p>
<p>of God the Father (having all power, etc.); the rst beast is clearly a </p>
<p>parody of Christ; and the second beast, although not directly related </p>
<p>to the Holy Spirit, is nonetheless referred to as a false prophet, who in </p>
<p>turn parodies the Spirit-inspired prophets of the church. is seems too </p>
<p>close to the heart of Johannine theology to be merely guesswork on the </p>
<p>part of the later interpreter. us a book that begins with clear refer-</p>
<p>ence to the Father, Son, and Spirit now in the middle suggests that its </p>
<p>demonic counterpart exists in Satan, the Empire, and emperor worship. </p>
<p>All of this serves as warning to God’s people not to participate in the </p>
<p>“religion” of the Empire, which is moving toward emperor worship as </p>
<p>a means of giving it cohesion. What follows seems intended by John to </p>
<p>pull several of the preceding pieces together in one place, even though, </p>
<p>as will be noted, some of the connections may not be immediately ob-</p>
<p>vious to a later reader, and especially so in a language other than the </p>
<p>original Greek.</p>
