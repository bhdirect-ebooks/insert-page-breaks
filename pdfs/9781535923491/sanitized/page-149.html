<p>e Fih Trumpet [= the First Woe]</p>

<p>e locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their </p>
<p>heads they wore something like crowns of gold, and their faces re-</p>
<p>sembled human faces. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>eir hair was like women’s hair, and their </p>
<p>teeth were like lions’ teeth. </p>
<p>9</p>
<p>ey had breastplates like breastplates </p>
<p>of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of </p>
<p>many horses and chariots rushing into battle. </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>ey had tails </p>
<p>like stingers, like scorpions, and in their tails they had power to </p>
<p>torment people for ve months. </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>ey had as king over them </p>
<p>the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in </p>
<p>Greek is Apollyon (that is, Destroyer).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>e rst woe is past, two other woes are yet to come.</p>
<p>With the trumpet blast of the h angel, the reader approaches the </p>
<p>height of John’s apocalyptic imagination, in which the whole scene </p>
<p>reveals a spectacular combination of images, with one gure being </p>
<p>transmogried into yet another. Indeed the imagery changes at such a </p>
<p>rapid pace that the reader who tends to visualize as he or she reads can </p>
<p>be le a bit bewildered. e narrative begins with a heavenly emissary </p>
<p>(in the form of a personied star) opening the great pit (“the Abyss”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>) </p>
<p>full of smoke as from a hot furnace. Beginning with verse 3, the ap-</p>
<p>pearance of locusts echoes the eighth plague of Egypt; at the same time </p>
<p>it also echoes the great locust plague of Joel 1 and 2, which Joel saw </p>
<p>as the harbinger of the Day of the Lord. But from the outset in John’s </p>
<p>description the locusts are likened to scorpions, whose ability to torture </p>
<p>is picked up in verse 5. Nonetheless, when their likeness is described, </p>
<p>and in keeping with the vivid imagery of Joel, they become an army of </p>
<p>“horses prepared for battle.” us everything about this scene is apoca-</p>
<p>lyptic and unnatural.</p>
<p>e trumpet blasts of the h and sixth angels, even though they </p>
<p>belong to the sequence of devastations that began in verse 6, are signi-</p>
<p>cantly dierent from the rst four in terms of both length and content. </p>
<p>At the same time the apocalyptic nature of the narrative also takes a </p>
<p>new turn: up to this point the various actors are living beings of some </p>
<p>kind; but with the content of this h trumpet blast the major player is </p>
<p>now a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth, whose fall itself, </p>
<p>7. e NIV translators have at this point (correctly) used the English term that has </p>
<p>been simply transliterated from the Greek abyssos, which occurs also in Luke 8:31 and </p>
<p>Rev 20:1. Its meaning in Greek is “bottomless” or “very deep”; it was used by the LXX </p>
<p>translators for the Hebrew thom, having to do with the primeval deep (cf. e.g., Gen 1:2; </p>
<p>7:11; Prov 8:28) and thus made its way into English as a borrowed word.</p>
