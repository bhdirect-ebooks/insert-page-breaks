<p>John’s Vision of Heaven—and Earth</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>sion (Sardis); and one has rather fully capitulated to the present culture </p>
<p>(Laodicea). us John writes to them all, while addressing each indi-</p>
<p>vidually, and does so both to encourage those who are faithful and to </p>
<p>warn those who are coasting, or playing in the enemy’s eld.</p>
<p>e nature of the coming crisis is not given explicit expression, but </p>
<p>has little to do with Christ’s return as such. In fact the key clause in all </p>
<p>of this appears in the letter to the believers in Philadelphia: “I will also </p>
<p>keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come upon the whole </p>
<p>world to test those who live on the earth” (3:10). Indeed, it is John’s </p>
<p>recognition that the church is headed for a time of severe trial that helps </p>
<p>the later reader to make sense not only of the book as a whole, but of the </p>
<p>next vision (chs. 4–6) in particular.</p>
<p>Several things happen in this vision that are important to under-</p>
<p>stand before one engages with the various details. First, no matter what </p>
<p>their present circumstances may be, the seven churches in their present </p>
<p>conditions are now called upon to look up and see visions of heaven. </p>
<p>And even though one never “sees” God, the reader is made aware of </p>
<p>God’s absolute, transcendent majesty. Indeed, so awesome is the scene </p>
<p>in chapter 4 that the reader instinctively feels—rightly so—a sense of </p>
<p>considerable distance from God because of his inherent glory. But what </p>
<p>makes the Revelation a particularly Christian book is found in chapter </p>
<p>5, where, in a scene that is equally awesome, God’s glory is now to be </p>
<p>understood in the context of the redeeming Lamb—but here readers </p>
<p>are drawn into the scene themselves. And since this is a Christian book, </p>
<p>to read either chapter apart from the other would be a fatal error both </p>
<p>hermeneutically and theologically.</p>
<p>In keeping with what has preceded, both parts of the vision are full </p>
<p>of Old Testament motifs, in the rst instance echoing various expres-</p>
<p>sions, including visions, of God’s transcendent majesty; in the second, </p>
<p>echoing messianic motifs of all kinds. e Lamb, who in contrast to </p>
<p>the Father is seen and described, is easily the key gure. His presence </p>
<p>thus sets some things in motion that are crucial to what follows. By </p>
<p>opening the seals, he is now not only the Risen One standing among the </p>
<p>churches, but also the Redeeming One whose death and resurrection </p>
<p>have given him the right to the “keys.” Furthermore, the whole is set in </p>
<p>the context of worship, which for John is equally as signicant as are the </p>
<p>descriptions themselves.</p>
