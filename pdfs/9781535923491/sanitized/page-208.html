<p>Revelation 13:1–18</p>
<p>186</p>
intended as some kind of parody of divine authority, especially echoing
<p>the narrative about Elijah in 1 Kings 18:18, even if we cannot know the </p>
<p>specics—although it is almost certainly a reection on the reality that </p>
<p>“magicians” can do what appears to be genuinely magical. And since </p>
<p>they were done in full view of everyone, this beast thus deceived the </p>
<p>inhabitants of the earth. is (probably very real) deception, whatever </p>
<p>it might have been, allowed this second beast to order them to set up </p>
<p>an image in honor of the rst beast, who is once more described as the </p>
<p>beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived.</p>
<p>e end result of this parody is that this second beast was given </p>
<p>[a passive verb that implies Satan as the author] power to give breath </p>
<p>to the image of the rst beast, so that the image could speak. Again, </p>
<p>this is most likely Johannine imagery pure and simple, as his way of </p>
<p>indicating that the real power of the Empire was Satan himself. us the </p>
<p>priests of the cult of the emperor, having power to do satanic “miracles,” </p>
<p>also had the power to cause all who refused to worship the image of </p>
<p>the beast (= the emperor) to be killed. And with this, one now has </p>
<p>insight into John’s own considerable prophetic insight as to what would </p>
<p>soon happen to followers of the Slain Lamb, who would in fact “refuse </p>
<p>to worship the image” of the beast.</p>
<p>What follows turns out to be another of the more infamous mo-</p>
<p>ments in the Revelation, since refusal on the part of followers of the </p>
<p>Lamb “to worship the image of the beast” would lead to their being </p>
<p>ostracized from most forms of everyday life in the Empire. e way </p>
<p>the Empire would be able to isolate them would be to “mark” them, as </p>
<p>those who refused to bear the mark of the beast himself. us regard-</p>
<p>ing Roman culture in general, John describes people’s compliance with </p>
<p>the emperor’s demands in terms of their being forced . . . to receive a </p>
<p>mark on their right hands or on their foreheads. e reason for this </p>
<p>particular placement of the mark is not certain, but it includes the most </p>
<p>visible portion of the human head and the hand both of greeting and </p>
<p>of closing business deals. is requirement itself was absolute and uni-</p>
<p>versal, so that it included all people, indicated as such by John’s noting </p>
<p>that it embraced those on the extreme ends of society: great and small, </p>
<p>rich and poor, free and slave. One can scarcely miss the implications. </p>
<p>e “small,” of course, refers to the “poor” and the “slave”; but those to </p>
<p>be numbered also include the “great,” and thus the “rich” and “free,” so </p>
<p>that even they are included among the marked.</p>
