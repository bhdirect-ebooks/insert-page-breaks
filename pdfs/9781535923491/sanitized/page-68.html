<p>Revelation 3:1–6</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>word of warning and admonition (vv. 1b–3), while only verse 4, by way </p>
<p>of contrast, is a word of commendation.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Indeed, perhaps the most</p>
<p>striking thing about this letter, especially for those who are reading the </p>
<p>letters in sequence, is this reversal of the order of things. Up to now </p>
<p>there has been commendation or praise, followed by judgment; here </p>
<p>that is reversed: judgment followed by commendation.</p>
<p>Christ’s identication in this case picks up two dierent items from </p>
<p>the vision in chapter 1. He is identied rst as him who holds the seven </p>
<p>spirits of God, and second as the one who holds the seven stars. e </p>
<p>striking thing about the former of these is that this holding of the seven </p>
<p>spirits is not said explicitly in chapter 1, where Christ is introduced. </p>
<p>Rather, there the “seven spirits of God” is John’s way of introducing the </p>
<p>Holy Spirit at the outset. Only here do we come across John’s own view </p>
<p>of the close relationship between Christ and the Spirit. at is, both </p>
<p>the Spirit and the churches are here identied in terms of their close </p>
<p>relationship to Christ himself.</p>
<p>What follows next is the somewhat normal: I know your deeds.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But what follows this is anything but normal, since the “deeds” in this </p>
<p>instance are not those to be commended, but those for which they </p>
<p>come under Christ’s judgment. It is not that there is no one or nothing </p>
<p>to commend—there is indeed (v. 4)—but that their overall condition is </p>
<p>utterly desperate in the eyes of the living Christ, although almost cer-</p>
<p>tainly not so in their own eyes, or in the eyes of others. What makes </p>
<p>this warning so poignant is that the judgment makes no mention of </p>
<p>either external pressures or immorality. ey are not racked by suer-</p>
<p>ing from without, nor wrenched by heresy within, nor ruined by inter-</p>
<p>nal moral decay. eir judgment is singular: they have a reputation of </p>
<p>being alive, but in fact are dead, which evidenced by the reality that </p>
<p>none of their works has ever been brought to completion: I have found </p>
<p>your works unnished in the sight of my God. Hence the rst word </p>
<p>to them is a wake up call; and in so doing they are to strengthen what </p>
<p>remains and is about to die. From the outside they look ne, they have </p>
<p>all the appearance of life; but on the inside there is no life at all, they </p>
<p>are as good as dead. From our distance we cannot know what all of this </p>
<p>19. It is of some interest that the original NIV translators chose to make a para-</p>
<p>graph break at v. 4, on the basis of the contrast with vv. 1b–3, rather than at the natural </p>
<p>stylistic breaking point, the commendation of the “victorious.”</p>
<p>20. See n. 3 above for the designation, “I know your deeds.”</p>
