<p>Revelation 9:1–12</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>us by once more employing this kind of repetition, John reinforces </p>
<p>the limited power of these scorpion-like locusts.</p>
<p>In something of a surprising move, John then concludes his de-</p>
<p>scription of the h angel’s trumpet by naming Satan as king over the </p>
<p>locusts. By describing him as the angel of the Abyss, John thus oers </p>
<p>a conclusion that also serves as an inclusio with verse 1. But to make </p>
<p>sure that his readers fully understand who this “angel” is, this “star </p>
<p>that had fallen from the sky,” John gives his full name, both in Hebrew </p>
<p>(Abaddon) and in Greek (Apollyon). For the sake of the English reader </p>
<p>the NIV translators chose at this point to make the same helpful rendi-</p>
<p>tion of this Hebrew (and Greek) word into English: that is, Destroyer. </p>
<p>us even though the people to whom John writes are currently under-</p>
<p>going persecution at the hands of the Empire, he is equally concerned </p>
<p>to let the persecuted know that the persecutors will eventually receive </p>
<p>theirs as well.</p>
<p>erefore, by his using (a) Joel’s locust plague to signify a powerful </p>
<p>army that will torture—now (b) combined with images hinting at the </p>
<p>barbarian hordes, which (c) are melded further into pictures that are </p>
<p>ultimately demonic in character—John announces God’s prior, tempo-</p>
<p>ral judgments that will befall the unrepentant dwellers on the earth.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is precisely this understanding that leads directly to the second, and </p>
<p>somewhat complementary, picture of the sixth trumpet. us John </p>
concludes this rst warning of divine judgment by announcing that the
<p>rst woe is past, two other woes are yet to come, a note that will be </p>
<p>picked up again aer the second woe (11:14). In this way the reader is </p>
<p>being told quite intentionally that the two woes and the double inter-</p>
<p>lude of 10:1–11 and 11:1–13 are to be understood as corresponding to </p>
<p>each other in some way, so that the second woe is not over until the </p>
<p>interlude itself is included.</p>
<p>The Sixth Trumpet [= the Second Woe] (9:13–21)</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>e sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice coming </p>
<p>from the four horns of the golden altar that is before God. </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>It said </p>
<p>to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels </p>
<p>who are bound at the great river Euphrates.”</p>
<p> 15</p>
<p>And the four angels </p>
<p>14. “Prior” in the sense that these judgments are expected within the framework of </p>
<p>history, and are not to be confused with the nal judgments in 19:11–21 and 20:7–15.</p>
