<p>Revelation 18:1—19:10</p>
<p>254</p>
<p>in this case is not random, but can easily be grouped into six categories, </p>
<p>which in John’s case are set o grammatically as well as by kind (note </p>
<p>the semicolons in the NIV), thus:</p>
<p>1) Precious metals and stones</p>
<p> gold (Spain)</p>
<p> silver (Spain)</p>
<p> precious stones (India)</p>
<p> pearls (highest quality from India)</p>
<p>2) Textiles (alternating between types of cloth and their dyes)</p>
<p> ne linen (mostly from Asia and Egypt)</p>
<p> purple (Asia Minor)</p>
<p> silk (from China, at great expense)</p>
<p> scarlet cloth (Asia)</p>
<p>3) Wood, ivory, metals</p>
<p>every sort of citron (root word of our “citrus”) wood</p>
<p> (North Africa)</p>
<p>ivory (which caused the depletion of the Syrian elephant;</p>
<p> so now mostly from Africa)</p>
<p> costly wood (ebony?)</p>
<p> bronze (Corinth)</p>
<p> iron (Spain, Pontus)</p>
<p> marble (Africa, Egypt, Greece)</p>
<p>4) Spices and perfumes</p>
<p> cinnamon (India, Ceylon)</p>
<p>spice (actually amomum, an aromatic spice from South</p>
<p> India)</p>
<p> incense (all over the East)</p>
<p> myrrh (from the Near East, used for perfumes)</p>
<p> frankincense (Southern Arabia, again for perfume)</p>
<p>5) Food products</p>
<p> wine (Sicily, Spain)</p>
