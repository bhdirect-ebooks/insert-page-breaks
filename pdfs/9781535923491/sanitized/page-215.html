<p>Two Interlude Visions</p>

<p>who “follow the Lamb wherever he goes,” they “were purchased from </p>
<p>among the human race” so as to be oered as rstfruits to God and </p>
<p>the Lamb. Here John is most likely picking up the imagery of Jeremiah </p>
<p>2:2–3, which refers to the rst Exodus:</p>
<p>I remember the devotion of your youth,</p>
<p> how as a bride you loved me</p>
<p>and followed me through the desert,</p>
<p> through a land not sown.</p>
<p>Israel was holy to the Lord,</p>
<p> the rstfruits of his harvest;</p>
<p>all who devoured her were held guilty,</p>
<p> and disaster overtook them.</p>
<p>With this imagery, and in keeping with this motif throughout the book, </p>
<p>John is warning his readers that these who are “rstfruits” also guar-</p>
<p>antee that a greater “harvest” (more martyrdoms) still awaits them. So </p>
<p>once more he is warning the churches that it will get far worse before it </p>
<p>gets better; that the early martyrs are the rst of more to come. At the </p>
<p>same time, those who would recognize the Jeremiah reference might </p>
<p>also see the future God has in store for the Empire: “disaster” will even-</p>
<p>tually “overtake them” as well.</p>
<p>e nal description of these rst martyrs is one that when read </p>
<p>in English as no lie was found in their mouths, can lead one to think </p>
<p>of everyday prevarication. But in biblical terms this language has to do </p>
<p>with what is ultimately true or false: good and evil in the larger sense, </p>
<p>as having to do with confessing Christ as Lord or denying him under </p>
<p>the threat of pain and death. Indeed, for John the incarnate Lord Jesus </p>
<p>is “the Way and the Life” because he is above all the ultimate embodi-</p>
<p>ment of “Truth” (John 14:6). us John concludes that they are blame-</p>
<p>less, most likely because under the threat of torture, and eventually of </p>
<p>death, they have proved themselves worthy of the Lamb. ese are they </p>
<p>who earlier in the book are viewed as singing, “Worthy is the Lamb,” </p>
<p>who had been slain for the sins of the world. Indeed, in John’s view to </p>
<p>deny Christ is the ultimate lie, just as confession of Christ as Lord is the </p>
<p>ultimate truth. us to reduce this nal clause to merely petty bbing </p>
<p>(as though any such lie is either petty or a mere b) is to miss John </p>
<p>by several miles. ey are “blameless,” and thus oered as “rstfruits,” </p>
<p>because in the context of his book they have not told the “lie” about the </p>
<p>Lamb, as to who he really is.</p>
