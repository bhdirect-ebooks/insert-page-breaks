<p>son Manasseh are mentioned, while Ephraim is not; second, the tribe </p>
<p>of Dan is omitted altogether; and third, the tribe of Levi is included, </p>
<p>whose place in the Old Testament listings, along with Joseph’s, is regu-</p>
<p>larly taken by Joseph’s two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. Moreover, </p>
<p>apart from the apparently purposeful placing of Judah at the head of </p>
<p>the list, and Benjamin at the end (thus the whole is embraced by the </p>
<p>two southern tribes), there seems to be no further signicance to the </p>
<p>order in which they are listed.</p>
<p>e omission of Dan is especially noteworthy, since from a very </p>
<p>early time (Ireneaus of Lyons, d. ca. 202 CE) it was suggested that Dan </p>
<p>was omitted due to a tradition that the antichrist was to come from </p>
<p>Dan. Such a view is probably related to the bad press Dan receives in </p>
<p>the Old Testament itself, beginning with Jacob’s “blessing” of his sons </p>
<p>in Genesis 49, where it is said that “Dan will be a snake by the road-</p>
<p>side, a viper along the path.” is negative view of Dan is furthered by </p>
<p>Jeremiah’s prophecy in 8:16–17, where “neighing stallions” from Dan </p>
<p>are pictured as having “come to devour the land and everything in it.” </p>
<p>Finally, in the Testament of Dan 5:6 the author says, “For I read in the </p>
<p>Book of Enoch the Righteous that your prince is Satan.” Most likely all </p>
<p>of this is based on two Old Testament narratives: Judges 18:30, where </p>
<p>“the Danites set up for themselves an idol”; and 1 Kings 12:29, where </p>
<p>Dan became the site of the Baal shrine. Whether John has omitted Dan </p>
<p>for these reasons is far from certain, although it is likely since there is </p>
<p>no place in John’s narrative for a personal Antichrist as such. In any </p>
<p>case, and for whatever reason, in the eschatological people of God John </p>
<p>sees no place for the tribe of Dan.</p>
<p>Perhaps the more signicant matter for our understanding is that </p>
<p>Judah, not Reuben, heads the current list. Along with the numbering </p>
<p>itself, therefore, two matters suggest that John is here intentionally </p>
<p>echoing Israel’s time in the desert, recorded in Numbers 1, where the </p>
<p>numbering served a twofold purpose. First, as is made clear in Numbers </p>
<p>1:45, they were numbered so as to serve in Israel’s army; second, in </p>
<p>Numbers 2:1–2 they are to encamp around the tent of meeting with </p>
<p>Judah in the place of primacy, thus anticipating the Davidic kingship. If </p>
<p>so, then here is yet another picture where John is pointing to the Holy </p>
<p>War. As the next scene makes clear, even though they are sealed from </p>
<p>God’s wrath, God’s people are not exempt from the war itself, where the </p>
<p>Lamb has taken the lead through his death and resurrection.</p>
