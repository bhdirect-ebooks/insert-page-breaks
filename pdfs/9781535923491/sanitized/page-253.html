<p>Rome as a Seductive Harlot (17:1–18)</p>
<p>e Introduction as Invitation (17:1–2)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and </p>
<p>said to me, “Come, I will show you the punishment of the great </p>
<p>prostitute, who sits by many waters. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>With her the kings of the </p>
<p>earth committed adultery and the inhabitants of the earth were </p>
<p>intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries.”</p>
<p>ese words serve as John’s introduction to the scene that follows. </p>
<p>us one of the seven angels (introduced in 15:1), who had the seven </p>
<p>bowls, approached John and invited him to come with the angel, so </p>
<p>that he might see the next scene. e angel promises to show John the </p>
<p>punishment of the great prostitute, who is further identied as geo-</p>
<p>graphically specic as one can expect in such a work: she is the one who </p>
<p>sits by many waters. For those of us who are used to picturing such </p>
<p>geographical moments in our heads, this is a striking understanding of </p>
<p>where Rome was situated, and one that could scarcely have been missed </p>
<p>by his readers. Even though Rome itself was inland several miles up the </p>
<p>Tiber River, her ultimate power lay not only with her armies but also </p>
<p>with her control over the entire Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>What follows immediately, however, is not the (coming) “punish-</p>
<p>ment” of Rome, but a further description of the city in terms of its her </p>
<p>relationship to much of the rest of the known world, at least that which </p>
<p>was under Roman control. But John begins not with Rome as preda-</p>
<p>tor and conqueror, but as a seductive harlot with whom the kings of </p>
<p>the earth committed adultery, thereby pointing to the complicity with </p>
<p>Rome of the rulers of the conquered lands. Because of Rome’s generally </p>
<p>benign policies as a conqueror, these “kings” had come to benet far </p>
<p>more than otherwise. us even though beneath the surface there ex-</p>
<p>isted a kind of love/hate relationship with Rome, it was more “love” on </p>
<p>the part of the “kings” of these various lands than it was “hate.” Indeed, </p>
<p>in the history of Western civilization, Rome probably beneted its </p>
<p>conquered peoples at least as much as, if not far more than, otherwise. </p>
Nonetheless, from the divine perspective, especially given the early
<p>Christians’ refusal to concede that any other than their risen Christ (in-</p>
<p>cluding the emperor) was “Lord,” the Empire in John’s eyes thus played </p>
