<p>severe persecution. Christ, himself “the faithful witness,” is above all </p>
<p>him who loves us and has freed</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>us from our sins by his blood. It is</p>
<p>of considerable interest, therefore, that John reminds the early believers </p>
<p>in Asia Minor that, even though many are headed for persecution and </p>
<p>martyrdom, they are nonetheless “free people” in Christ.</p>
<p>One should note in particular the present tense (“loves us”) fol-</p>
<p>lowed by the past tense (“freed us from our sins”). It is of some interest </p>
<p>that later scribes were disturbed by this apparent grammatical oddity </p>
<p>and thus changed it to “who loved us and has freed us.” But these later </p>
<p>scribes have missed John by several furlongs! For John’s readers, many </p>
<p>of whom were already experiencing persecution, the rst truth about </p>
<p>Christ is that he (currently) “loves us” with a present love that gains its </p>
<p>signicance and power from the fact that he is the One who (already) </p>
<p>“has freed us from our sins by his blood.”</p>
<p>All of this continues to be expressed in Exodus (now New Exodus) </p>
<p>language. God’s own “rstborn” people, Israel, who became so by means </p>
<p>of God’s sovereign election, have now been reconstituted through Christ </p>
<p>and the Holy Spirit. But that is not all; the same Christ who “loves us </p>
<p>and has freed us from our sins” is also the one who has made us to </p>
<p>be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father. is some-</p>
<p>what ambiguous acclamation, using language borrowed directly from </p>
<p>Exodus 19:6, probably means rst of all that God’s newly formed people </p>
<p>are a new kingdom, replacing the former Davidic kingdom. Redeemed </p>
<p>by Christ’s sacrice on their/our behalf, people like the recipients of </p>
<p>this Revelation—and us—have been freed not from Egypt but from the </p>
<p>power of sin itself, reconstituted to be God’s own newly formed people. </p>
<p>At the same time they/we are to serve as his “priests” on behalf of oth-</p>
<p>ers, especially those who continue to be slaves to sin and thus to the </p>
<p>power of Satan.</p>
<p>is reminder sets John o in praise and acclamation, but he does </p>
<p>so in a way that could seem quite ambiguous to the later reader since in </p>
<p>English it is not at all clear as to whom the “to him” refers in the con-</p>
<p>cluding acclamation, to him be glory and power for ever and ever! In </p>
<p>order to remove the ambiguity the NIV has (rightly) put a dash before </p>
<p>7. Greek λύσαντι, which is read by all the early and most important witnesses, as </p>
<p>well as by half of the later majority; perhaps as a mistake of hearing, the other half </p>
<p>of the later witnesses have λούσαντι (“washed”), which had the misfortune of being </p>
<p>present in the manuscript that stood behind the KJV.</p>
