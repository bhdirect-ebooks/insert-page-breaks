<p>Introduction</p>
<p>xiii</p>
<p>having seven heads and ten horns; and while we understand what a </p>
<p>“beast” might be, and what “heads” and “horns” are, human beings </p>
<p>have no experience of them in this combination. ird, the apocalypses </p>
<p>tend to be formally stylized, which oen includes the symbolic use of </p>
numbers. Time and events are divided into neat numerical packages,
<p>as in John’s Apocalypse, where the three major sections (chs. 6–7, 8–11, </p>
<p>15–16) are all sets of 4-2-1, with a twofold interlude between the last </p>
<p>two (sixth and seventh) in each case.</p>
<p>While John is true to the genre in each of these rst three char-</p>
<p>acteristics, he diers radically from them in the nal two—and that </p>
<p>because he is not just an apocalyptic writer, he is himself a Christian </p>
<p>prophet who is speaking directly to his own generation. us, in con-</p>
<p>trast to other apocalypses, all of which come to us under pseudonymous </p>
<p>names, John identies himself from the outset—and does so as a fellow </p>
<p>traveler and fellow suerer with those to whom he writes. Because of </p>
<p>his abandonment of pseudonymity, he also abandons the h feature </p>
<p>of all prior apocalypses, namely, the command to “seal up” what he has </p>
<p>written for it to be read at a “later time.” is is a literary device the </p>
<p>earlier apocalyptists employed so as to give their own document a sense </p>
<p>of “hoary age,” so that what they were writing to their contemporaries </p>
<p>appeared to come to them from centuries past. By way of contrast John </p>
<p>is explicitly told not to “seal it up” (22:10), precisely because John un-</p>
<p>derstands what he has written to be “the words of the prophecy of this </p>
<p>scroll” (22:18).</p>
<p>John, therefore, is not simply anticipating the End, as were his </p>
<p>Jewish predecessors and contemporaries; rather, he knows the End to </p>
<p>have begun with Jesus, through his death, resurrection, and ascension. </p>
<p>Absolutely crucial to all of this is his understanding of the Spirit as hav-</p>
<p>ing come to be with God’s people until the End, and thus as the way </p>
<p>the Risen Lord continues to be with them. Other apocalyptic writers </p>
<p>wrote in the name of an ancient worthy, because theirs was the age of </p>
<p>the “quenched Spirit”; hence prophecy, which comes by the Spirit, had </p>
<p>ceased. But John belongs to God’s “new era,” evidenced by the coming </p>
<p>of the Spirit. us John says about his book that he “was in the Spirit” </p>
<p>(1:10–11), and that what he writes is “this prophecy” (1:3; 22:18–19); </p>
<p>and this because “the testimony of [the risen] Jesus is the Spirit of </p>
<p>prophecy,” that is, that the message given by and about Jesus is the clear </p>
<p>evidence that the prophetic Spirit has come.</p>
