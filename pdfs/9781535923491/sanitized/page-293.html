<p>e Last Battle and the End of Evil</p>
<p>271</p>
<p>It is especially important for the modern reader to recognize John’s </p>
<p>own ways of holding the whole narrative together as one story, since </p>
<p>the majority of its recipients could not have read it for themselves, but </p>
<p>would have had it read to them. One of the ways he has done this is by </p>
<p>means of both transitional and anticipatory moments that are intended </p>
<p>to connect things as well as to hold them together along the way. us, </p>
<p>for example, “the 144,000” are rst mentioned in 7:4–8 in anticipation </p>
<p>of their standing on Mount Zion in 14:1–5; likewise the earthquake as </p>
<p>the sixth seal (6:12–17) anticipates the great earthquake as the seventh </p>
<p>bowl in 16:17–21. e same is true of the cry of the second angel in </p>
<p>14:8, “Fallen, fallen,” which looks forward to the dirge and laments in </p>
<p>chapter 18.</p>
<p>In the same way the two matters yet to be taken up in the book, the </p>
<p>Last Battle and the saints’ “nal glory,” have both been anticipated in a </p>
<p>variety of ways. us the Last Battle was anticipated by the sixth trum-</p>
<p>pet (9:13–19), with the appearance of a phenomenal cavalry from the </p>
<p>Euphrates. is is then picked up again in the sixth bowl (16:12–16), </p>
<p>where the place of the battle is named Armageddon. Similarly, and now </p>
especially important for the present material, Christ as divine warrior
<p>was anticipated by the “sword out of his mouth” in the opening vision </p>
<p>in 1:16 (cf. 2:12 and 16), and by the use of Psalm 2:7 in Revelation 12:5, </p>
<p>where the Davidic warrior messiah conquers those “kings of the earth” </p>
<p>who conspire against God and his king. Likewise Christ’s present tread-</p>
<p>ing “the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty” (v. 15) was </p>
<p>anticipated by that imagery in 14:19–20, where the passive voice of that </p>
<p>narrative is now presented in the active voice.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>The Last Battle, Part 1: The Battle Itself (19:11–21)</p>
<p>Perhaps the most striking feature of the narrative of the Last Battle as </p>
<p>such is the fact that here, in contrast to almost everything else that has </p>
<p>preceded it, John no longer echoes the language of his Bible, our Old </p>
<p>Testament, but language from several places in his own narrative up </p>
<p>to this point. us, in this single instance in the commentary I have </p>
<p>chosen to underline these echoes in the text itself, and then to list them </p>
<p>with their corresponding moments earlier in the narrative. In many </p>
<p>2. See the introduction to the nal section of the book below (pp. 289–305) for the </p>
<p>similar phenomenon with regard to the future of the saints themselves.</p>
