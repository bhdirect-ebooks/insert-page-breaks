<p>Revelation 15:1–8</p>
<p>210</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Aer this I looked and in heaven the temple, that is, the </p>
<p>tabernacle of the covenant law, was opened. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Out of the temple </p>
<p>came the seven angels with the seven plagues. ey were dressed </p>
<p>in clean, shining linen and wore golden sashes around their chests. </p>
<p>7</p>
<p>en one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels </p>
<p>seven golden bowls lled with the wrath of God, who lives for ever </p>
<p>and ever. </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>And the temple was lled with smoke from the glory of </p>
<p>God and from his power, and no one could enter the temple until </p>
<p>the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.</p>
<p>In light of the echoes (noted above) of the original set of plagues against </p>
<p>Pharaoh and Egypt in Exodus 7–11, this prelude to the last set of seven </p>
<p>plagues in John’s Revelation is likewise full of echoes of the original </p>
<p>exodus. At the same time, it is also has several deliberate echoes of </p>
<p>the second exodus from Babylon, the cryptic name for Rome that rst </p>
<p>emerged in the eagle’s announcement of her coming doom in 14:8. </p>
<p>In keeping with the narrative to this point, John thus begins, I saw in </p>
<p>heaven another great and marvelous sign, which is immediately iden-</p>
<p>tied as seven angels with the last seven plagues.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>en, for the sake</p>
<p>of John’s rst readers, he elaborates so that they might understand what </p>
<p>follows without any guesswork on their part. ese are the last set of </p>
<p>plagues, because with them God’s wrath is completed, “wrath” that </p>
<p>was anticipated in 6:16–17 as of both the Lamb and God, and echoed </p>
<p>again in 11:16. In 14:10, however, and picked up again here, this wrath </p>
<p>is now that of God alone. e phrase “is completed” in this case would </p>
<p>seem rst of all to refer to the seven plagues themselves; at the same </p>
<p>time it probably also tells the reader that there will be no more such sets </p>
<p>of seven. What remains to be narrated is the spelling out in some detail </p>
<p>as to how this wrath will play out historically on Rome itself, and thus </p>
<p>on its great empire.</p>
<p>John’s follow-up description of this twofold reality has several </p>
<p>echoes (understandably so) of the original heavenly scene in chapters </p>
<p>4–5, now joined with the “victors” from chapter 13. e entire scene </p>
<p>also echoes Israel’s miraculous escape from Pharaoh in Exodus 14, </p>
<p>while also anticipating the song of judgment against Pharaoh in Exodus </p>
<p>15. is is narrative art at its nest. Pictured here is the ultimate New </p>
<p>2. Whether intentional on John’s part or not, this passage also reects the promised </p>
<p>punishment for disobedience found in Lev 26:21: “If you remain hostile toward me, . . . </p>
<p>I will multiply your aictions seven times over.”</p>
