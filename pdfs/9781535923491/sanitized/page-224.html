<p>Revelation 14:14–16</p>
<p>202</p>
<p>tive, thus having to do with the nal gathering of God’s own for their </p>
<p>eternal rest. But since no outcome of the harvest is noted, it has been </p>
<p>the wont of many to read it negatively, as a companion to the clearly </p>
<p>negative gathering and crushing of the grapes that follows. In response </p>
<p>one might equally note that no one could very easily read it that way </p>
<p>were it not followed by the next imagery.</p>
<p>So at issue, nally, is what should prevail in one’s interpretation: </p>
<p>either what is said (or in this case, not said) in the text itself, or its </p>
<p>supposed relationship to the passage that follows. Since a grain harvest </p>
<p>seldom serves as a negative image in Scripture,</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>and since the passage</p>
<p>lacks the explicit metaphor of judgment found in the next imagery </p>
<p>(“trampled in the winepress outside the city”), it seems far more likely </p>
<p>that John here intended two contrasting images, the rst one of the </p>
<p>gathering of the righteous, the second of the judgment of the wicked.</p>
<p>As throughout, the narrative begins with John’s once more telling </p>
<p>the reader I looked; but what follows is especially “clipped” in the Greek, </p>
<p>which the NIV translators have (correctly) put into idiomatic English: </p>
<p>and there before me was a white cloud. us, whatever John might </p>
<p>have envisioned by the metaphor itself, he clearly intends this scene to </p>
<p>image something “above the earth,” not on it. e real issues of inter-</p>
<p>pretation, therefore, are located in the rest of the sentence that makes </p>
<p>up our verse 14. e diculties in this case, however, do not lie with </p>
<p>the relatively understandable imagery itself, namely, that seated on the </p>
<p>cloud was one like a son of man with a crown of gold on his head and </p>
<p>a sharp sickle in his hand; rather they lie altogether with its meaning. </p>
<p>e problems for interpretation here are several, which initially lie basi-</p>
<p>cally in three areas: (a) that “son of man” is itself a Hebrew idiom that </p>
<p>simply means “a human person”; (b) that in the Synoptic tradition this </p>
<p>term is a primary means of self-identication by Jesus himself; and (c) </p>
<p>that in John’s Gospel this term appears much less frequently, and always </p>
<p>when the emphasis is on Jesus’ (then) present human life. Indeed, had </p>
<p>John’s narrative not been followed by the next sentence, that “another </p>
<p>angel” gave instruction to the “one like a son of man,” almost everyone </p>
<p>would have thought of this as a referent to Christ. e ultimate dif-</p>
<p>culty, however, does lie with what is said next, that in context this “one </p>
<p>2. e lone exceptions in the OT are Jer 51:33 and Joel 3:13, the latter being the </p>
<p>only other place it is accompanied by the twofold outcome of harvest: in that case </p>
<p>garnering the wheat and burning the cha.</p>
