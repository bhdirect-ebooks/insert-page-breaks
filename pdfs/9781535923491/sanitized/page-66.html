<p>Revelation 2:18–29</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>But that is not all. Christ will also give them the morning star. </p>
<p>Here is yet another obscure image for those of us reading the docu-</p>
<p>ment at a much later time. e term rst occurs in an especially obscure </p>
<p>passage in Isaiah 14:12, where it most likely refers to the fallen king </p>
<p>of Babylon, and thus has a negative referent. But the present usage is </p>
<p>altogether positive, and in 22:16 below Christ himself is called “the </p>
<p>bright Morning Star.” us perhaps what John understood this to mean </p>
<p>was that the victors will be given eschatological glory, which they will </p>
<p>share with Christ himself. Or perhaps this is a somewhat obtuse way </p>
<p>of indicating that they will receive Christ himself (= be eternally in his </p>
<p>presence) as the ultimate prize of their victory.</p>
<p>To the Church in Sardis (3:1–6)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>“To the angel</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> of the church in Sardis write:</p>
<p>ese are the words of him who holds the seven spirits</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>of God</p>
<p>and the seven stars. I know your deeds; you have a reputation of </p>
<p>being alive, but you are dead. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Wake up! Strengthen what remains </p>
<p>and is about to die, for I have found your deeds unnished in the </p>
<p>sight of my God. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Remember, therefore, what you have received </p>
<p>and heard; hold it fast, and repent. But if you do not wake up, I </p>
<p>will come like a thief, and you will not know at what time I will </p>
<p>come to you.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their </p>
<p>clothes. ey will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are wor-</p>
<p>thy. </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>ose who are victorious will, like them, be dressed in white. </p>
<p>I will never blot out their names from the book of life, but will ac-</p>
<p>knowledge their names before my Father and his angels. </p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Whoever </p>
<p>has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</p>
<p>Of the seven cities to whose churches these letters are written, Sardis </p>
<p>easily outstrips the others in terms of its antiquity and well-known his-</p>
<p>tory. Its most famous king, the sixth-century Croesus, became legend-</p>
<p>ary for his wealth. Indeed, in some ways the city of John’s time had </p>
<p>everything: choice location, climate, economy, wealth, and culture. But </p>
<p>the city also presents us with an interesting paradox, since its history </p>
<p>and signicance were both real and illusory.</p>
<p>16. Or messenger; also in verses 7 and 14.</p>
<p>17. at is, the sevenfold Spirit.</p>
