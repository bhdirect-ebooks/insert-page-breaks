<p>Interlude 1: e Angel and the Little Scroll</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>in turn said to John, now in the language of Ezekiel, Take it and eat it. </p>
<p>It will turn your stomach sour, but ‘in your mouth it will be as sweet </p>
<p>as honey.’ en in verse 10, John narrates his obedience to this com-</p>
<p>mand: I took the little scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it. And</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>happened just as he had been promised: It tasted sweet as honey in my </p>
<p>mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach turned sour.</p>
<p>is in turn leads to the crucial interpretive matter in the conclu-</p>
<p>sion, then I was told, where the NIV has turned John’s plural (“and </p>
they say to me”) into a “divine passive.” Most likely this is a plural of divine action, where the Godhead is understood to be speaking to John
<p>(although this would not have been his own language). With a verb </p>
<p>that implies this burden has now been laid on him (literally, “it is nec-</p>
<p>essary for you”), John is told, You must prophesy again about many </p>
<p>peoples, nations, languages and kings. is is the third such list in the </p>
<p>book</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>; the unique feature of this one is the substitution of “kingdoms” </p>
<p>for “tribes,” which occurs in all the other lists except the one in 17:15, </p>
<p>where “multitudes” is substituted for “tribes.” e substitution in this </p>
<p>case can only be intentional. John is being told that he must prophesy </p>
<p>to those who are, and will become, part of the people of God; but he </p>
<p>is also to prophesy against “kings,” which is what chapters 12 and 13 </p>
<p>are basically all about. is is almost certainly the interpretive key to </p>
<p>the “sweet” and “bitter” in the preceding sentence. What John must </p>
<p>prophesy, beginning in our chapter 12, will on the one hand be “sweet </p>
<p>as honey,” because it is God’s word; on the other hand, it will “turn [his] </p>
<p>stomach sour” because the same word will call for suering on the </p>
<p>part of some people (believers) and judgment on others (the Empire). </p>
<p>But before that, and in keeping with the preceding interlude visions in </p>
<p>chapter 7, John presents a second interlude vision, in which in this case </p>
<p>he plays a merely cameo role at the beginning.</p>
<p>Interlude 2: The Temple and the Two Witnesses (11:1–14)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>I was given a reed like a measuring rod and was told, “Go and </p>
<p>measure the temple of God and the altar, with its worshipers. </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>But exclude the outer court; do not measure it, because it has </p>
<p>27. For reasons that are not altogether clear, the NIV translators made an adversa-</p>
<p>tive “but” out of what appears to be a simple narratival “and” (kai) at this point.</p>
<p>28. For more on these lists see p. 85 n. 24 regarding the rst instance (5:9).</p>
