<p>Revelation 16:1–21</p>
<p>224</p>
<p>Great Battle that is nally narrated in 19:11–21. But as oen happens </p>
<p>in the narrative, while John’s point seems ready at hand, the grammar </p>
<p>can be elusive, so that the English translations, even the so-called literal </p>
<p>ones, show considerable ambivalence as to how it should be handled—a </p>
<p>diculty illustrated early on in the copying tradition. e problem for </p>
<p>the reader lies not with the words as such, but with what John intended </p>
<p>by them, so much so that early scribes tried to alleviate it somewhat by </p>
<p>a simple change from a verb in the singular to making it plural. What </p>
<p>John (almost certainly) wrote was (as the KJV correctly had it) “and </p>
<p>he gathered them together.” At issue is nding a proper antecedent for </p>
<p>the singular verb and its direct object, “he gathered them.” Along with </p>
<p>other versions, the NIV translators rendered this then they gathered </p>
<p>the kings together. In so doing they chose to go with what is by all text-</p>
<p>critical judgments a secondary reading, “they” for “he.” But in doing so, </p>
<p>the translators failed in any case to alleviate the diculties as such; who </p>
<p>are the “they” and why simply “the kings”?</p>
<p>Although one cannot be certain, the better solution would seem </p>
<p>to be to take the text as it stood (apparently) in its original setting, and </p>
<p>recognize that John did not intend the ambiguity that resulted. us </p>
<p>the “he” implied in the (third singular) verb is most likely intended by </p>
John to be a verb signaling divine intention. If so, then John probably
<p>meant “Christ [or God] gathered them together.” Indeed, in this case </p>
<p>most of the issues are resolved if one sees this, in typical fashion for </p>
<p>John’s overall narrative, as anticipatory of the Final Battle that will be </p>
<p>spelled out in greater detail in the later narrative (19:11–21). Aer all, </p>
<p>this is but the second, in this case very brief, member of a two-part </p>
<p>interlude, both parts of which seem intended to anticipate much of the </p>
<p>rest of the story. And if this is the way we are in fact to understand it, </p>
<p>we are once more confronted with John’s own striking narrative art. </p>
<p>is is but another signpost along the way for the big event that will be </p>
<p>narrated a little further on.</p>
<p>In many ways the more striking moment is the nal one in this </p>
<p>brief interlude: that “he [God is almost certainly intended as the un-</p>
<p>named subject of the verb] gathered them together” to the place that in </p>
<p>Hebrew is called Armageddon. One’s initial response probably should </p>
<p>be, “What?” at is, what can possibly be the point both of naming </p>
<p>the place as such and then of giving only the Greek form of a Hebrew </p>
<p>name? Not only so, but this is in fact the only occurrence of the name </p>
