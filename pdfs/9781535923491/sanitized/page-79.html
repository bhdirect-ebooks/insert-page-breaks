<p>To the Church in Laodicea</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked. </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>I counsel you to </p>
<p>buy from me gold rened in the re, so you can become rich; and </p>
<p>white clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; </p>
<p>and salve to put on your eyes, so you can see.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>ose whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest, </p>
<p>and repent. </p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone </p>
<p>hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with </p>
<p>them, and they with me.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>To those who are victorious, I will give the right to sit with </p>
<p>me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat down with my </p>
<p>Father on his throne. </p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Whoever has ears, let them hear what the </p>
<p>Spirit says to the churches.”</p>
<p>Laodicea, the last of the ve cities on the northwesterly, southeasterly </p>
<p>interior highway of Anatolia, was also the crossroads for the highway </p>
<p>east and west. It therefore rather automatically became the premier city </p>
<p>of the tri-cities in the Lycus River valley (which included Colossae and </p>
<p>Hierapolis). It was also an extremely wealthy city, a fact noted in all </p>
<p>kinds of deliberate and incidental ways throughout ancient historical </p>
<p>and literary remains. It had become famous for three reasons in par-</p>
<p>ticular: rst, for all practical purposes they were the Swiss bankers of </p>
<p>antiquity, which meant that it was a city of considerable wealth; second, </p>
<p>they were famous for a breed of sheep that produced an extremely ne </p>
<p>and desirable black wool; and third, their proximity to a hot springs </p>
<p>across the river made them a kind of medical center, famous worldwide </p>
<p>for a specially mixed eye salve. It is therefore not dicult to see how </p>
<p>in many respects it became “like city, like church”; indeed, practically </p>
<p>everything in the letter reects some aspect of a church located in this </p>
<p>setting.</p>
<p>One should note at the beginning that the description of Christ </p>
<p>in this nal letter now abandons the vision in 1:16–18 altogether, in </p>
<p>favor of a series of brief epithets. First, Christ reveals himself to them </p>
<p>as the Amen, thus arming the truth about God the Father to which </p>
<p>he is bearing witness. Second, he is the faithful and true witness, lan-</p>
<p>guage from 1:5 with the addition of the adjective “true.” ird, he is </p>
<p>the ruler of God’s [= all] creation, a most striking appellation, both </p>
<p>for the Apocalypse as a whole and for this letter in particular. Indeed, </p>
<p>the closest thing to it in the New Testament is the armation by Paul </p>
<p>in Colossians 1:15 that the Son “who is the image of the invisible God” </p>
