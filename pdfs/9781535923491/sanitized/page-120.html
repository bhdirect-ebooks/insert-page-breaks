<p>Revelation 6:1–17</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>emperor. As much as Vespasian may have wished to think of himself </p>
<p>as the “sovereign lord” of his vast empire, that empire nonetheless had </p>
<p>known boundaries that limited his actual sovereignty, whereas there </p>
<p>are no such limitations to the living God. e addition holy and true, </p>
<p>which occurs only here in the Bible in this combination, is nonetheless </p>
<p>language used in descriptions about God that can be found throughout </p>
<p>the Old Testament. “Holy” describes God’s eternal character; “true” </p>
<p>reminds the readers of God’s veracity. In this case, the description is </p>
<p>especially relevant to the prayer itself, which appeals to that veracity in </p>
<p>light of the present martyrdoms. us their question is not one of if or </p>
<p>whether, but in keeping with the Psalmists, it is when (“How long?”),</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> </p>
<p>since God’s holiness and trustworthiness are foundational to their ex-</p>
<p>pectation of judgment on those responsible for their deaths.</p>
<p>e expectation of judgment itself is expressed as a doublet, and </p>
<p>assumes the much larger expectation of judgment on all who are not </p>
<p>followers of the Lamb, identied here simply as the inhabitants of the </p>
<p>earth. But in the present case this much larger group is given specic </p>
<p>identity in relationship to the anticipated martyrdoms; thus at issue is </p>
<p>how long . . . until you . . . avenge our blood, which has been spilt by </p>
<p>“the inhabitants of the earth.” At this point one should remember that, </p>
<p>whatever else, this is an apocalypse, a writing intended to oer some </p>
<p>measure of comfort to its readers in terms of ultimate realities, even </p>
<p>if present ones will be of little if any comfort. And if their plea sounds </p>
<p>negative in the ears of modern readers in Western cultures, in fact most </p>
<p>such readers would be less than pleased to live under the heavy-handed </p>
<p>rule of the kind of totalitarianism of the Roman Empire, even though </p>
<p>it was of a more “enlightened” variety. Aer all, the Neronian persecu-</p>
<p>tions were but a small foretaste of the holocaust that would be periodi-</p>
<p>cally unleashed against Christians in the succeeding two centuries.</p>
<p>e striking response to this plea of the martyrs tends to serve as </p>
<p>anything but a comforting word to those in distress, since basically the </p>
<p>answer is that it will get worse—far worse—before it gets better. us </p>
<p>each of them was given a white robe, language that both picks up on </p>
<p>the promise made to the faithful in Sardis (3:4–5) and anticipates the -</p>
<p>nal resurrection, which will be further noted in this way in 7:13–14. But </p>
<p>before that event, they were told to wait a little longer, the reason for </p>
<p>37. See inter alios Ps 13:1; 79:5; 89:46; 90:13; 119:84; cf. Isa 6:11 and Zech 1:12.</p>
