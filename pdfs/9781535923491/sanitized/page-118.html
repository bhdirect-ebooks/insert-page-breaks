<p>Revelation 6:1–17</p>

<p>ery to tell the story of the present. In any case, John seems to have three </p>
<p>basic theological concerns in the greater vision: rst, to portray graphi-</p>
<p>cally the majesty and sovereignty of God the Trinity (chs. 4–5); second, </p>
<p>to reassure the churches that God, not the imperial enemy, is ultimately </p>
<p>in control, hence Christ breaks the seals and the four living creatures </p>
<p>call for the evil ones to do their thing; and third, to point out that the </p>
<p>way to victory is not through an escape from death or martyrdom, but </p>
<p>through death itself. Divine vindication will come later, but God’s vic-</p>
<p>tory unmistakably leads through the cross. As Charles Wesley put it, “It </p>
<p>is the way the Master went, should not the servant tread it still?”</p>
<p>e Fih Seal: e Martyrs (6:9–11)</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>When he opened the h seal, I saw under the altar the souls </p>
<p>of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the </p>
<p>testimony they had maintained. </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>ey called out in a loud voice, </p>
<p>“How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the </p>
<p>inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?” </p>
<p>11</p>
<p>en each of </p>
<p>them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little </p>
<p>longer, until the full number of their fellow servants and brothers </p>
<p>and sisters were killed just as they had been.</p>
<p>While the preceding four seals have both similar structure and similar </p>
<p>content, this seal and the next have only a roughly similar structure. </p>
<p>Together they depict the two key groups of those who live on earth at </p>
<p>the time of John’s writing: the followers of the Lamb, who have been </p>
<p>slain by “those who dwell on the earth” (vv. 9–11); and those who dwell </p>
<p>on the earth themselves (vv. 12–14). e absolutely crucial matter for </p>
<p>the rest of the present narrative, not to mention for the book as a whole, </p>
<p>are the questions raised by the two groups. e martyrs ask, “How long, </p>
<p>Sovereign Lord, . . . until you avenge our blood?” (v. 10). e rest, on </p>
<p>their day of judgment, cry out, “e day of their [God and the Lamb’s] </p>
<p>wrath has come, and who can withstand it?” (v. 12). ese two seals, </p>
<p>therefore, complement each other while at the same time they prepare </p>
<p>one for much that follows.</p>
<p>e content of this h seal comes in three clear parts, corre-</p>
<p>sponding in this case to the verse numbering. In verse 9 the martyrs </p>
<p>are described as those who had been slain because of the word of God </p>
<p>and the testimony they had maintained. is is another remarkably </p>
