<p>Revelation 1:4–8</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>at the beginning of all things and is continuously there, and thus at the </p>
<p>end—and this only from our limited point of view, since God is eternal </p>
<p>and therefore timeless. us God is also the One who is, and who was, </p>
<p>and who is to come, a choice of word order that is hardly accidental on </p>
<p>John’s part. Whatever else is true about God, he is the Eternal One, al-</p>
<p>ways the “I am”; so John begins with the present tense, and then points </p>
<p>backward and forward to stress God’s eternal nature.</p>
<p>e nal word then punctuates what has preceded by stress-</p>
<p>ing that God is the Almighty, language that recurs throughout the </p>
<p>Old Testament, and which occurs twice (vv. 4–5) in the oracle from </p>
<p>Zechariah 12 that immediately precedes the one John has just echoed. </p>
<p>is designation, which occurs elsewhere in the New Testament outside </p>
<p>the Revelation only in 2 Corinthians 6:18, will occur some eight more </p>
<p>times in this book. us John concludes with a word that stresses the </p>
<p>absolute, unparalleled power of the one and only God; he alone is “the </p>
<p>Almighty.” It is not dicult to see in this emphasis a Christian response </p>
<p>to the Empire, whose emperors and armies had caused her to regard </p>
<p>herself in terms of invincibility.</p>
One should note also, nally, that the description of the divine
<p>speaker as “the Lord God” and “the Almighty” is language once again </p>
<p>derived directly from the prophetic tradition. In this case John is reect-</p>
<p>ing Amos 4:13 (in the LXX), where the oracle concludes, “the Lord God </p>
<p>Almighty is his name.” In the present instance, and almost certainly for </p>
eect, John divides up this divine name by inserting the phrase “the
<p>One who is, and who was, and who is to come” between “the Lord God” </p>
<p>and “the Almighty.” us the concluding self-identication puts most </p>
<p>of the emphasis on God’s being the Eternal One, but whose identity </p>
<p>here concludes with God’s being the All-Powerful One.</p>
<p>At the conclusion, one might ask further, why all of this as a way </p>
<p>of introducing John’s Apocalypse? at is, how does it function so as to </p>
<p>introduce the reader/hearers to what they are about to encounter? e </p>
<p>answer to this seems to be twofold: rst, it theologically grounds what </p>
<p>they are about to see in God the Trinity; second, at the same time, it </p>
<p>focuses especially on Christ and his work, which John does both by de-</p>
<p>scription (v. 5a) and by doxology (vv. 5b–6). us the way is paved for </p>
<p>the introduction to the rst vision in verses 12–20. But before that, in a </p>
<p>piece of extraordinarily straightforward historical narrative, the readers </p>
<p>are given the circumstances of the author and the cause of his writing.</p>
