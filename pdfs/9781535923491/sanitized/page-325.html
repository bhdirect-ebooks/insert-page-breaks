<p>A New Earth: Eden Restored</p>
<p>303</p>

<p>ey will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>ere will be no more night. ey will not need the light of a </p>
<p>lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. </p>
<p>And they will reign for ever and ever.</p>
<p>In what must be considered as one of the great moments in the Christian </p>
<p>Bible, John brings the present narrative to its proper conclusion by merg-</p>
<p>ing the glorious city of the preceding narrative with a reprise from the </p>
<p>very beginning of the biblical narrative—thus at the end picturing the </p>
<p>city itself as a restoration of the garden of Eden. It is therefore a matter </p>
<p>of considerable misfortune that the one responsible for inserting num-</p>
<p>bers into the text so thoroughly missed the role of this passage in John’s </p>
<p>overall narrative. Here is not something new, which thereby introduces </p>
<p>the concluding matters of the book; rather, this is the climactic moment </p>
<p>in the entire book: the city with its “river of the water of life” streaming </p>
<p>from “the throne of God and the Lamb”; “the tree of life,” forbidden </p>
<p>to Adam and Eve, now available to all; no more curse; and “no more </p>
<p>night,” with God and his redeemed ones face to face, as it were. us in </p>
<p>the providence of God, the Christian Bible concludes with a restoration </p>
<p>of the beginning, before the fall and thus before the curse. Moreover, </p>
<p>the genuinely Johannine nature of this concluding word is especially </p>
<p>visible here, with its reversal of all that went wrong in the fall. us it </p>
<p>begins with “the water of life” and concludes with endless, eternal light, </p>
<p>and with God’s “servants” reigning “for ever and ever.”</p>
<p>e continuity with what precedes is especially clear in the Greek </p>
<p>text, where the new sentence begins simply with “he” showed me, in-</p>
<p>tending the same angel who has been the active presenter in the entire </p>
<p>conclusion, which the NIV and other English translations, including </p>
<p>so-called literal ones like the ESV, have made plain by inserting the </p>
<p>intended noun. What the angel now showed John was the river of the </p>
<p>water of life, which is described as being as clear as crystal, not so </p>
<p>much meaning that one can see through it, but “clear” in the sense of </p>
<p>“without impurities,” thus translucent. Since it is “the water of life,” John </p>
<p>therefore begins with its source, owing from the throne of God and </p>
<p>of the Lamb, and concludes with its location, down the middle of the </p>
<p>street of the great city. How could it be other than “the river of the </p>
<p>water of life”?</p>
