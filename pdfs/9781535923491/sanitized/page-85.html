<p>Fusing the Horizons: Christ and His Church(es)</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>pressure very often leads to mediocrity and complacency. This is not a call </p>
<p>to a form of self-imposed self-ﬂagellation, but rather a call to a kind of </p>
<p>stewardship and discipleship that will make the complacent uncomfortable </p>
<p>enough to try to counteract it with fury and scorn, rather than with benign </p>
<p>neglect. Rather than wearing gold or silver crosses around our necks, we </p>
<p>would better portray our devotion to Christ by being more like the Cruciﬁed </p>
<p>One amidst a world of self-centeredness and greed.</p>
<p>May the ever merciful, ever compassionate God and his Christ come to </p>
his church in the West and re-create us back into the divine image that is so
<p>faithfully portrayed in this ﬁnal book of the Christian canon.</p>
