<p>e Fall of Babylon the Great</p>
<p>261</p>
<p>Before going on to the details, the “mighty angel” announces the </p>
<p>primary meaning of his action, that with such similar violence the </p>
<p>great city of Babylon will be thrown down; and because the stone was </p>
<p>thrown into the sea, “the great city” is never to be found again. e </p>
<p>next ve lines of the poetry (vv. 22–23b) then spell out in brief detail, </p>
<p>and by way of example only, what that will mean for “the Eternal City,” </p>
<p>each concluding with the litany will never be . . . in you again. e </p>
<p>ordering of these judgments holds its own intrigue, as John moves from </p>
<p>musicians to tradespeople to a single example of the latter. ese are </p>
<p>then followed by the loss of evening lights and the fact that there will be </p>
<p>no more weddings, thus no further children as well. e nal lines (vv. </p>
<p>23c–24) then give the reasons for these judgments: Rome’s seduction of </p>
<p>“all the nations” and, especially, her slaughter of “the prophets and the </p>
<p>saints.”</p>
<p>So John begins the dirge with the loss of the most important reali-</p>
<p>ties for those who live in cities: rst the lighter side, the reality of music </p>
<p>that makes any city livable, and then the necessary trades that make </p>
<p>a city possible. First up then is the loss of joy: e music of harpists </p>
<p>and musicians, pipers and trumpeters, will never be heard in you </p>
<p>again, the rst of three judgments which are described by the loss of the </p>
<p>sounds that make up a city. A city without music would be no city at all, </p>
<p>but a mausoleum, so this is the rst thing John mentions when “great </p>
<p>. . . Babylon [is] thrown down.”</p>
<p>e second and third items then move on to the actual reasons for </p>
<p>a city: trades and their workers, those responsible for the existence of a </p>
<p>city in the rst place, as well as for keeping it functioning. To make this </p>
<p>point John starts with the all-inclusive no worker of any trade will ever </p>
<p>be found in you again. en to make that point both more poignant </p>
<p>and more devastating, he illustrates by noting next, and thereby also </p>
<p>returning to the imagery with which he began, that the sound of a mill-</p>
<p>stone will not be heard in you again. In many ways this is the more </p>
<p>telling moment in the overall imagery. It is one thing to be told that the </p>
<p>city will be without trades of any kind, but that point is best heard when </p>
<p>it means the loss of one’s daily bread.</p>
<p>e next image, e light of a lamp will never shine in you again, </p>
<p>is especially memorable for those of us in North America who lived </p>
<p>through the Second World War, with the awesome eeriness of blackout </p>
<p>sirens that plunged towns and cities into such utter darkness that they </p>
