<p>Revelation 14:1–13</p>
<p>192</p>
have a special place in the divine economy. us, no one could learn
<p>the song they were singing except the 144,000 themselves, who had </p>
<p>been redeemed from the earth. is most unusual locution simply </p>
<p>collapses into one clause the twofold reality that their heavenly exis-</p>
<p>tence was already assured (“redeemed from the earth”), and that it was </p>
<p>so because of the work of Christ (they “had been redeemed”).</p>
<p>Even though what follows is a description that has tended to </p>
<p>defy the best eorts of readers and interpreters, one can nonetheless </p>
<p>make relatively good sense of it if one keeps it in the context of the </p>
<p>Holy War. Aer all, celibacy as such is nowhere seen as a virtue in the </p>
<p>New Testament. Rather, John is here using Holy War imagery pure and </p>
<p>simple, while at the same time he is anticipating verse 8, where “fallen </p>
<p>Rome” is pictured as being judged because she, Babylon the Great, </p>
<p>“had made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulter-</p>
<p>ies.” Crucial to this understanding are two combined phenomena from </p>
<p>the Old Testament regarding Israel’s own “holy war”: that soldiers were </p>
<p>forbidden sexual relations during times of war, and that idolatry is </p>
<p>commonly denounced as a form of adultery (in the dated but exquisite </p>
<p>language of the KJV, “going awhoring aer other gods”). In such a con-</p>
<p>text one can make perfectly good sense of the next clause, that these are </p>
<p>those who did not dele themselves with women, for they remained </p>
<p>virgins. is is not a celebration of celibacy as such, but imagery point-</p>
<p>ing toward the reality that the Holy War has already begun, and that </p>
<p>God’s people must prepare themselves for it in the same way as did the </p>
<p>soldier in ancient Israel.</p>
<p>at this is John’s own point seems to be made certain by the way </p>
<p>the paragraph concludes. First, they are described as those who fol-</p>
<p>low the Lamb wherever he goes, which John most likely intended to </p>
<p>have a double focus. Contextually, and as the rst thing up, John sees </p>
<p>the martyrs in heaven, in the special company of the Lamb whose own </p>
<p>“martyrdom” they had emulated. us in keeping with the story, they </p>
<p>are envisioned as his closest followers in the heavenly entourage.</p>
<p>But that is not all. eir current presence in the heavenly scene </p>
<p>is further pictured by way of Old Testament sacricial language. First, </p>
<p>the martyrs are described as purchased from among the human race; </p>
<p>and even though not made explicit, for John the purchase price has </p>
<p>been “the blood of the Lamb.” us they belong to God in this special </p>
<p>way; as martyrs (in the rst meaning of that Greek word, “witnesses”) </p>
