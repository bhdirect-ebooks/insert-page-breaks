<p>e Dramatis Personae: John Introduces Himself and His Recipients</p>

<p>case, but is rather an adjective coined from the noun “Lord,” and means </p>
<p>something like “in honor of” or “pertaining to” the Lord. Although </p>
<p>some debate surrounds this word, it should be noted that by the mid-</p>
<p>second century this word was used to distinguish Christian from Jewish </p>
<p>devotion,</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> thus indicating that it had already been in use for a consid-</p>
<p>erable length of time. Given the signicance of Sabbath observance for </p>
<p>the earliest followers of Jesus, who were Jewish, the only possible expla-</p>
<p>nation for the phenomenon of calling Sunday “the Lord’s Day” is the </p>
<p>probability that they held a weekly remembrance of the resurrection.</p>
<p>In this setting John announces, I heard behind me a loud voice </p>
<p>like a trumpet. Whether John intended this to mean that the voice itself </p>
<p>sounded like a trumpet, or whether this is merely associative language </p>
<p>(the voice had the eect of a trumpet call) cannot be known. But in </p>
<p>either case one can be quite certain that this is an echo of the three-</p>
<p>fold mention of Israel’s hearing “a very loud trumpet” at Sinai (Exodus </p>
<p>19:16/19 and 20:18). Whatever else, John probably intended this to be a </p>
<p>wake-up call for the recipients. But sounding “like a trumpet” as it did, </p>
<p>it is nonetheless still a “voice,” one that had something to say to John </p>
<p>himself.</p>
<p>e content of what the voice says is in eect a command for John </p>
<p>to write the document we know as the Revelation; but it comes to him </p>
<p>by way of the vision he is about to be given. He is rst told to write </p>
<p>on a scroll what you see. is is followed by a second command, hav-</p>
<p>ing to do with its primary destination: send it to the seven churches: </p>
<p>to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, yatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, </p>
<p>and Laodicea. ese churches when connected by road make a long, </p>
<p>thin horseshoe-shaped semi-circle from Ephesus through Smyrna to </p>
<p>Pergamum in the north—still on or close to the Aegean Sea—and then </p>
<p>inland in a south-southeasterly direction down to Laodicea, which is </p>
<p>about eighty miles east and slightly south of Ephesus. e spiritual con-</p>
<p>ditions of these churches, in light of the coming holocaust, is what will </p>
<p>dominate John’s concerns in chapters 2 and 3.</p>

<p>I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And </p>
<p>when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands, 13and among the </p>
