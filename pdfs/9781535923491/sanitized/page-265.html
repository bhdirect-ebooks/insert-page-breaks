<p>e Fall of Babylon the Great</p>
<p>243</p>
<p>mentarily to drop the apocalyptic language and framework and oers </p>
<p>the most straightforward prophetic moment in the entire book; and </p>
<p>when apocalyptic language does appear it is mere dressing in this case. </p>
<p>Here John has joined the prophetic guild in a thoroughgoing way.</p>
<p>Even so, what follows is a clear continuation of the vision that </p>
<p>began in the preceding chapter, where Rome is pictured as a harlot. </p>
<p>Although she is not called the harlot again until 19:2, imagery from </p>
<p>the preceding description continues to appear throughout. us in </p>
<p>verse 3 John speaks of “the maddening wine of her adulteries,” so that </p>
<p>“the kings of the earth committed adultery with her,” which is repeated </p>
<p>again in verse 9. So also the imagery in verse 14 is that of a courtesan </p>
<p>harlot, who loves to parade her beauty and expensive tastes, while verse </p>
<p>16 basically repeats 17:4. One should note further that here there is </p>
<p>none of the “beast” or military imagery from earlier in the book. And </p>
<p>the martyrdom of the saints, which comes directly from their refusal to </p>
<p>worship the emperor, is mentioned only in passing at the very end (v. </p>
<p>24 and 19:2)—lest anyone forget.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for this is the clear shi in focus. Both the struc-</p>
<p>ture and actual language, plus the absence of other motifs, indicate that </p>
<p>John is no longer interested in Rome’s military might; rather he is here </p>
<p>denouncing her economic policies, through which the leading families </p>
<p>in Rome in particular had become fabulously wealthy during the years </p>
<p>in which John was writing. us it is not surprising that when John </p>
<p>echoes the Old Testament in this passage, the majority of these come </p>
<p>from prophetic passages spoken against Babylon and Tyre, the latter be-</p>
<p>cause for Israel she had played the role of economic harlot in the same </p>
<p>way as Babylon had played the role of oppressive, idolatrous military </p>
<p>power. So in John’s view the military “beast” and the economic “harlot” </p>
<p>are now blended into one power in Rome.</p>
<p>Echoing Isaiah 29:1, the passage begins with a lament over fallen </p>
<p>Babylon (vv. 1–3). is is followed in turn with a warning to God’s peo-</p>
<p>ple to “ee Babylon” (vv. 4–8), and then with a series of three laments </p>
<p>(vv. 9–19), expressed by those who had the most to gain by their unholy </p>
<p>alliance with the Empire—the petty “kings of the earth” (vv. 9–10), the </p>
<p>merchants (vv. 11–17a), and the merchant marine (vv. 17b–19)—all of </p>
<p>whom had “prostituted” themselves with the great “whore.” To these la-</p>
<p>ments there is added a call to God’s people to rejoice over Babylon’s fall </p>
<p>(v. 20). At the end, the absolute nality of these judgments is expressed </p>
