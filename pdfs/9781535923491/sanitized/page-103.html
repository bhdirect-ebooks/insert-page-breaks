<p>in him; but he has also been “lied up” (= exalted) through his resur-</p>
<p>rection and ascension, so that he now rightfully reigns on high. us </p>
<p>the Lamb stands “in the center before the throne”; and there, as the </p>
<p>narrative proceeds, he is also “worshiped on high.” At the end of the </p>
<p>book, signicantly, the throne is nally referred to as “the throne of God </p>
<p>and of the Lamb” (22:1, 3).</p>
<p>One should therefore also note that John’s latent Trinitarianism </p>
<p>is in place here as well, as he goes on to describe the Lamb as having </p>
<p>seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits [“sevenfold </p>
<p>Spirit”</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>] of God sent out into all the earth. It is easy to read past this </p>
<p>imagery too quickly, and thus to miss a signicant christological mo-</p>
<p>ment for John—signicant because it is otherwise unnecessary to the </p>
<p>present narrative. Two points are here being made by the two images. </p>
<p>First, the Lamb’s “seven horns” appear to be an ironic parody of Daniel’s </p>
<p>beasts (Daniel 7), which emerge later in chapter 13 as a single beast </p>
<p>with ten horns on seven heads. In apocalyptic usage horns are imagery </p>
<p>for political authority of some kind; so the Lamb with its seven horns </p>
<p>will nally best the beast with its ten. At the same time the imagery </p>
itself indicates that the Lamb really does have divine authority, which
<p>will be the point of the second song that follows in verse 12. So the rst </p>
<p>song, the “new song” in verses 9–10, will celebrate the Lamb’s redemp-</p>
tive role, while the second will celebrate his divine authority.
<p>But for now, second, the Lamb’s eyes are interpreted in terms of </p>
<p>the Holy Spirit. In this way John’s own form of nascent Trinitarianism </p>
<p>comes to the fore, since the “seven eyes” are to be understood as “the </p>
<p>sevenfold Spirit of God.” In this way, John’s own understanding of the </p>
<p>Spirit, as simultaneously the Spirit of God and of Christ, is kept intact. </p>
<p>One should also note that this is the last mention of the Spirit in the </p>
<p>heavenly court, since his primary role is altogether on earth. us the </p>
<p>Spirit is noted once more as “sent out</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> into all the earth.” John’s un-</p>
<p>derstanding of the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of both the Father and the </p>
<p>Son, a particular feature of the Fourth Gospel as well,</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>is made clear</p>
<p>18. On the NIV footnote as the proper way to understand John’s language of “seven </p>
<p>spirits of God,” see p. 6 above.</p>
<p>19. A signicant number of Greek manuscripts have this participle in the present </p>
<p>tense, most likely as some later scribes’ way of giving the text currency for their own </p>
<p>day.</p>
<p>20. See esp. the extended discourse in John 13–16, of which 15:26 is typical: “When </p>
