<p>e (Original) Tale of Two Cities, Part 1: e Demise of Rome</p>
<p>229</p>
<p>Cities”—as the tale of two women, a prostitute (17:1–18) and a righ-</p>
<p>teous bride (21:9—22:5).</p>
<p>at John intends the reader to make these connections is made </p>
<p>certain by the deliberate links he makes between the two narratives at </p>
<p>their beginning and end. At the beginning of each (17:1 and 3, and </p>
<p>21:9–10) he pictures one of the seven angels with the last seven plagues </p>
<p>as transporting him by the Spirit (17:3; 21:10). He is rst taken to a des-</p>
<p>ert place to see the great harlot (Rome) come under judgment, and then </p>
<p>to a high mountain to see the bride of the Lamb (the New Jerusalem) </p>
<p>come down from heaven—and thus to replace the former.</p>
<p>Each narrative then concludes in much the same way. In 19:9–10 </p>
<p>the angel tells John, “Write: ‘Blessed are those who are invited to the </p>
<p>wedding supper of the Lamb,’” adding that “these are the true words </p>
<p>of God.” John responds to this by falling at the angel’s feet to worship, </p>
<p>to which the angel in turn responds, “Don’t do that! [For] I am a fel-</p>
<p>low servant”; rather he is to “Worship God!,” to which a nal reason is </p>
<p>attached: “ese are the true words of God.” Similarly in 22:6 and 8–9, </p>
<p>the angel again tells John, “ese words are trustworthy and true,” add-</p>
<p>ing further that “the Lord, the God who inspires the prophets, sent his </p>
<p>angel to show his servants the things that must soon take place.” And </p>
<p>again, John responds by falling at his feet to worship, to which this angel </p>
<p>responds, “Don’t do that! I am a fellow servant,” which again is followed </p>
<p>by “Worship God!” e only signicant dierence between these two </p>
<p>concluding moments is with the angel’s nal words. In the rst instance </p>
<p>he concludes with the enigmatic explanation, “for the testimony of </p>
<p>Jesus is the Spirit of prophecy,” whereas the second instance concludes, </p>
<p>“because the time is near.”</p>
<p>Between these two scenes lies the narrative of the Last Battle; rst </p>
<p>as the battle called Armageddon (19:11–21), and second—following </p>
<p>“the thousand year interlude” designed to reassure the martyrs (20:1–</p>
<p>6)—as the nal doom of the “unholy trinity” of Satan and the two </p>
<p>beasts (20:7–15). All of this at the same time takes one back to chapters </p>
<p>15 and 16, to note how they t into the overall scheme. As noted there, </p>
<p>the vision of the seven last plagues has a variety of ties with what had </p>
<p>preceded; but it also has clear ties with what follows, as something of a </p>
<p>prelude. us in sequence John has narrated:</p>
