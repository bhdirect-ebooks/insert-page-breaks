<p>deny justice to the oppressed” (2:6–7). And Isaiah likewise begins his </p>
<p>book with, “Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. Defend the cause of </p>
<p>the fatherless, plead the cause of the widow” (1:17). is is the tradi-</p>
<p>tion to which Jesus, and now John aer him, was heir; and thus John </p>
<p>prophesies that the merchants who sold these things [listed above] </p>
<p>and gained their wealth from Rome will stand far o, terried at her </p>
<p>torment.</p>
<p>Beyond that, they will also weep and mourn, and their mourning </p>
<p>becomes the second in the series of three woes. But John can scarcely </p>
<p>let go of his indignation, so their twofold woe to the great city in this </p>
<p>case is followed by a further mention of her clothing and jewelry. us, </p>
<p>picking up from the second category of cargoes listed above, Rome is </p>
<p>herself now described as dressed in ne linen, purple and scarlet, </p>
<p>while her adornment picks up from the rst category: glittering with </p>
<p>gold, precious stones and pearls. us with a marvelous play on the </p>
<p>imagery with which this woe began, John concludes his lament over </p>
<p>“the merchants of the earth” by noting that the “great city” that pur-</p>
<p>chased all their wares has been judged by God, so that in one hour such </p>
<p>great wealth has been brought to ruin!</p>
<p>e ird Woe: e Merchant Marine (18:17b–19)</p>
<p>“Every sea captain, and all who travel by ship, the sailors, and all </p>
<p>who earn their living from the sea, will stand far o. </p>
<p>18</p>
<p>When they </p>
<p>see the smoke of her burning, they will exclaim, ‘Was there ever </p>
<p>a city like this great city?’ </p>
<p>19</p>
<p>ey will throw dust on their heads, </p>
<p>and with weeping and mourning cry out:</p>
<p>“‘Woe! Woe to you, great city,</p>
<p> where all who had ships on the sea</p>
<p> became rich through her wealth!</p>
<p>In one hour she has been brought to ruin!’</p>
<p>Still following the basic narrative of Ezekiel 27 and its prophesied demise </p>
<p>of Tyre, and now picking up from 27:4 (“your domain was on the high </p>
<p>seas”), John’s third lament in this series is that of the merchant marine. </p>
<p>eir demise would be an especially devastating blow to Rome and its </p>
<p>Empire, since everyone’s existence by now was absolutely dependent </p>
<p>on the sea. us with the demise of the “great city,” all those so depen-</p>
<p>dent go into mourning, starting with those who pilot the ships (every </p>
