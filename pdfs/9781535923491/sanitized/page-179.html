<p>e Seventh Trumpet: Conclusion to the Introductory Vision</p>
<p>157</p>
<p>of God from both covenants in heaven); verse 19, however, reminds the </p>
<p>reader that this is not a vision of the end itself. Rather, two things are </p>
<p>seen in heaven: God’s temple with the ark of the covenant; and another </p>
<p>theophany, grander than those that have preceded, which in this case </p>
<p>includes yet another earthquake. us the present paragraph seems to </p>
<p>serve a double purpose: to conclude the narrative to this point, and to </p>
<p>prepare the reader for the more blow-by-blow account of what believers </p>
<p>may expect before the End itself, which has only been anticipated thus </p>
<p>far, but which will be elaborated in greater detail in the coming chapters. </p>
<p>It is of further interest to note that in a book that tends to be christocen-</p>
<p>tric, this preliminary view of the End is thoroughly theocentric.</p>
<p>us John begins with the seventh angel sounding his trumpet, </p>
<p>which was accompanied by loud voices in heaven. e trumpet thereby </p>
<p>signals “the beginning of the End,” as it were, while the anticipated End </p>
<p>itself is announced by the “loud voices in heaven,” who in eect declare </p>
<p>the “already but not yet” dimension of the kingdom of God. On the </p>
<p>one hand, the voices said: “e kingdom of the world has become </p>
<p>the kingdom of our Lord and his Messiah,” an announcement that for </p>
<p>several reasons is full of puzzles for the careful reader. By all the rules </p>
<p>of grammar, the past tense of the verb (“has become”) implies that with </p>
<p>this announcement there is something that has now already taken place. </p>
<p>Moreover, the “kingdom” announced here is that of “our Lord and his </p>
<p>Messiah,” which is the only certain passage in the New Testament where </p>
<p>the word kyrios is used of God the Father rather than of Christ. At the </p>
<p>same time, even though there is some slight ambiguity in the passage, </p>
<p>this present moment seems to be a declaration from heaven itself that </p>
<p>the Messiah’s rule, a “kingdom” where he will reign for ever and ever,</p>
<p>42</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is now in eect.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>But that said, the rest of the passage is thoroughly</p>
<p>theocentric, as the focus turns once more from the Son to the Father.</p>
<p>us following the acclamation of the “loud voices in heaven,” </p>
<p>which point to Christ as King, everything from this point on focuses </p>
<p>singularly on God the Father. us the response of the twenty-four </p>
<p>42. Although this sentiment can be found throughout the OT, the present language </p>
<p>is a close echo of the LXX of Ps 10:16.</p>
<p>43. is cannot be proven, of course, since the sentence is thoroughly ambigu-</p>
<p>ous; and a strong case can be made for its referring to God the Father here, since the </p>
<p>worship that follows is strictly theocentric. e view taken here is that vv. 16–18 oer </p>
<p>response to God the Father in light of what is said here regarding Christ.</p>
