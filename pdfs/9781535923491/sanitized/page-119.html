<p>e Opening of the First Six Seals</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>prophetic moment in the book, since up to this point the only known </p>
<p>person to be martyred because of his faith was Antipas of Pergamum </p>
<p>(2:13). What John sees clearly is that his was but the beginning of hun-</p>
<p>dreds more to come. eir martyrdom in this case—and of the many </p>
<p>more to come—would be the result of their adherence to “the Word of </p>
<p>God” and to maintaining their own “testimony.” is is now the third </p>
<p>instance of the combination of “word” and “testimony,” which appeared </p>
<p>rst in 1:2 and 9, where the latter is called “the testimony of Jesus.” As </p>
<p>before, the two phrases most likely mean “the word from God” and </p>
<p>“their testimony about Jesus.” Here the emphasis is not on the content </p>
<p>of their testimony as such, but on their loyalty to it; it was “the testi-</p>
<p>mony they had maintained.” In John’s view this is the essence of what </p>
<p>had led, and would continue to lead, to martyrdom—the insistence </p>
<p>on the part of believers that the crucied, now risen Jesus is Lord, the </p>
<p>only Lord, and thus not the emperor, who as a mere earthling would </p>
<p>dare to assume such a title for himself. Indeed, probably as much as, </p>
<p>if not more than, anything else, this unyielding persistence on the part </p>
<p>of these early believers to refer to the risen Jesus alone as “Lord” would </p>
<p>lead them toward a path of martyrdom. us, in its own way this seal in </p>
<p>particular anticipates much of the rest of the book.</p>
<p>e opening of the seal is itself described in three clear parts. First, </p>
<p>the martyrs are described as under the altar. Since there will be no altar </p>
<p>as such to be found in heaven (!), this imagery is most likely occasioned </p>
<p>by the fact that in Jewish thinking their temple was a kind of earthly </p>
<p>counterpart to heaven, as noted earlier regarding the lamps and sea of </p>
<p>glass (4:5–6). at these martyrs are followers of the Lamb is made clear </p>
<p>by John’s use of the same verb for them as for the Lamb himself—they </p>
<p>have been “slain.” Moreover, the reason for their martyrdom echoes that </p>
<p>found earlier in the book, where John identies himself as their fellow </p>
<p>suerer, because of “the word of God and the testimony [to Jesus]</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>they</p>
<p>have borne” (6:9).</p>
<p>ese martyrs, in turn, called out in a loud voice the rst of the </p>
<p>two leading questions that anticipate the rest of the book. e address </p>
<p>itself, Sovereign Lord, is language from the Septuagint, used most likely </p>
<p>in this case as a Christian armation about the living God vis-à-vis the </p>
<p>36. A large sector of the Greek manuscript tradition has here added “to [lit. ‘of’] </p>
<p>the Lamb,” but not the manuscript lying behind the received text on which the KJV </p>
<p>was dependent.</p>
