<p>Revelation 14:1–13</p>
<p>196</p>
<p>the essential clue as to the role of these three angels. Primarily, they </p>
<p>serve to anticipate the rest of the book; at the same time they continue </p>
<p>to remind John’s readers of the goal of everything: worship of the eter-</p>
<p>nal God as Creator of all things. By repeating the descriptive language </p>
<p>used in 10:5, John reminds them again that the God they serve is the </p>
<p>one who made the heavens, the earth, and the sea, to which John here </p>
<p>adds that God is the creator of fresh water as well, thus the springs of </p>
<p>water. is rst word in response to the coming martyrdoms serves as </p>
<p>another reminder that the eternal God “is the ruler yet.”</p>
<p>e reason for the content of the rst angel’s proclamation be-</p>
<p>comes apparent with the second angel who followed, since the next </p>
<p>word is one of judgment on Rome itself. Echoing Isaiah 21:9, the angel </p>
<p>announces in the past tense (!), Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great. </p>
<p>With these words, and for the rst of three times, Rome is likened to </p>
<p>Israel’s ancient nemesis, Babylon. At John’s moment in history this </p>
<p>would have been a courageous word indeed, but of such courage are the </p>
<p>prophets made. e reason for God’s judgments are then noted in brief, </p>
<p>to be spelled out in greater detail in 18:1–20, which begins (v. 2) by re-</p>
<p>peating this doom oracle. Here for the rst time the Empire is pictured </p>
<p>as the ultimate harlot. e “harlot’s” ultimate sins are that she made </p>
<p>all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries, language </p>
<p>which in keeping with the imagery seems to be echoing Jeremiah 51:7. </p>
<p>is is almost certainly intended to be a word of encouragement to the </p>
<p>churches as they continue to bear witness to Christ at the outset of what </p>
<p>John recognizes is the coming holocaust. However the rest of the world </p>
<p>may have seen Rome, which in its own arrogance saw itself as oer-</p>
<p>ing the world the Pax Romana (“Roman peace”), the prophet John saw </p>
<p>their “peace” as in bold resistance to God and to God’s people. us he </p>
<p>pictures her (Rome and its Empire) in the role of a harlot, seducing the </p>
<p>whole known world by “the maddening wine of her adulteries.” us </p>
<p>the second angel’s announcement anticipates the longer narrative of </p>
<p>chapter 17.</p>
<p>e third angel is then given the longest of these brief speeches, </p>
<p>to whose introduction is added, and said with a loud voice (= pay at-</p>
<p>tention, reader). e content of the speech intentionally ties the present </p>
<p>material directly back to what has preceded in chapter 13, thus serving </p>
<p>to connect these two visions for the sake of the reader. At the same time </p>
<p>John totally reverses the role of the martyrs and those who worship the </p>
