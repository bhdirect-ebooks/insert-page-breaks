<p>Revelation 12:1—14:13</p>
<p>162</p>
<p>on earth who belong to the Lamb, and are thus a constant reminder </p>
<p>of his defeat. In the following chapter (13), John then anticipates how </p>
<p>the dragon (Satan) will engage the Holy War on earth through the two </p>
<p>beasts.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Finally, in chapter 14 John pictures the nal outcome of the</p>
<p>Holy War, which includes the triumph of the Lamb and his people, ac-</p>
<p>companied by an invitation to the nations to join his people, and con-</p>
<p>cludes with the eschatological harvest (of “the saints” most likely</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>) and </p>
<p>the winepress of God’s judgment against the evil ones.</p>
<p>Before looking at the passage in some detail, it might help for one </p>
<p>to read the next three chapters together and, by way of overview, to </p>
<p>become aware of the primary theological motifs that one encounters in </p>
<p>the text. e main theme throughout is the Holy War. e two primary </p>
<p>words for this in Greek are the noun polemos (“war”), plus its cognates, </p>
<p>and the verb nikao (“triumph”). us in 12:7 “war” between the arch-</p>
<p>angel Michael and the dragon occurred in heaven, resulting in Satan’s </p>
<p>being cast out of heaven. Again, in 13:4, but now on earth, the question </p>
<p>is put as to “who can make war against [the beast]?” who in verse 7 is </p>
<p>said to have been “given power to make war against God’s people and to </p>
<p>conquer them.” In this latter passage the verb “to conquer” is the same </p>
<p>as that translated “are victorious” in its appearance at the end of each of </p>
<p>the letters to the seven churches. But here also (in 12:11) occurs the key </p>
<p>theological sentence of the entire book: “And they triumphed over him </p>
<p>by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did </p>
<p>not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.”</p>
<p>is motif is now expressed explicitly in terms of John’s thorough-</p>
<p>going “already but not yet” eschatological perspective, which has been </p>
<p>noted in earlier chapters. Now in chapter 12 it is spelled out in verses </p>
<p>10–12 with as much clarity as one will ever get in apocalyptic literature. </p>
<p>Salvation has already come, and the saints have thus already “triumphed </p>
<p>over [Satan]” through “the blood of the Lamb” (v. 11), but “woe to the </p>
<p>earth . . . because the devil has gone down to you” (v. 12). us John </p>
<p>keeps alive the tension one has previously seen at work in chapter 5, </p>
<p>where the “Lion of the tribe of Judah” who has triumphed turns out to </p>
<p>be a Slain Lamb. So here, the Messiah is pictured in the language of the </p>
<p>1. One should note especially how 12:17 and 13:1 make it clear that the dragon </p>
<p>stands behind everything.</p>
2. On this issue, on which scholarship is quite divided, see the discussion of 14:14–
<p>16 below (pp. 201–2).</p>
