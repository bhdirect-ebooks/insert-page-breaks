<p>Revelation 22:6–11</p>
<p>308</p>
<p>With these words John begins a series of items, each necessary to bring </p>
<p>the entire narrative to its rightful conclusion, but which to some readers </p>
<p>may not seem to be especially related. e series begins with the reveal-</p>
<p>ing angel speaking to John once more, whose pronouncement includes </p>
<p>the key word “soon.” at in turn triggers a direct word from the risen </p>
<p>Christ himself with regard to his coming, followed by another beati-</p>
<p>tude, plus a (needed) reminder that the revealing angel is not himself </p>
<p>to be worshiped, and a nal word about what to do with what John has </p>
<p>been writing.</p>
<p>e rst word (v. 6) comes as something of a disclaimer from the </p>
<p>revealing angel, one of the seven angels from chapter 16 who has been </p>
<p>speaking with John. Very much in keeping with what the angel told </p>
<p>John at the conclusion of the “tale of the rst city” in 19:9–10, the af-</p>
<p>rmation once more is that these words are trustworthy and true. To </p>
<p>this assertion is added the evidence for it: that words come from the </p>
<p>Lord, who is then identied in such a way as to validate the content of </p>
<p>the book. But “the Lord” here, in a case unique to the book, is not Christ </p>
<p>but the God who inspires the prophets, who is further identied as </p>
<p>the source of the content of what John has written. us God sent his </p>
<p>angel to show his servants the things that must soon take place, refer-</p>
<p>ring now, of course, not to what John will yet write, but to what he has </p>
<p>written thus far. Although the word “soon” can be ambiguous in some </p>
<p>settings, John seems to be referring not to the nal events, about which </p>
<p>he has just written, but to those that will soon overtake the believers in </p>
<p>Asia Minor to whom John is writing.</p>
<p>is is then followed by an indirect armation from Christ himself, </p>
<p>the one who, according to the opening words of the book, has received </p>
<p>this “revelation” from God the Father and has been giving it to John, by </p>
<p>way of several angels. Look, the risen Christ says to the readers of the </p>
<p>book, I am coming soon! is armation thus takes the reader back </p>
<p>to verse 7 in the introduction and serves as a kind of inclusio for the </p>
<p>book as a whole. But whereas in the rst instance John is citing Daniel </p>
<p>7:13, and thus puts it in the third person, here Christ himself speaks in </p>
<p>the rst person. But now the adverb “soon” is a bit more dicult for </p>
<p>readers at a much later time in history. Here it seems quite ambiguous </p>
<p>as to whether the emphasis is on the soon-ness” of Christ’s appearing (a </p>
<p>temporal referent) or on its “suddenness” (when least expected), or in </p>
<p>this case perhaps a combination of both nuances.</p>
