<p>Revelation 21:9–27</p>
<p>302</p>
<p>vation that on no day will its gates ever be shut, the reason for which </p>
<p>being that there will be no night there. is reection of rst-century </p>
<p>culture makes it clear that one of the primary reasons for city gates had </p>
<p>to do with safety at night; and this further indicates the great diculty </p>
<p>such a passage holds for modern readers, most of whom live in cities </p>
<p>and towns where lights are never darkened.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>A further implication is</p>
<p>that sleep will no longer be a necessity in a fully redeemed world.</p>
<p>e nal two descriptors of the splendor of the “new Jerusalem” </p>
<p>pick up on and elaborate the further outcome of what has preceded. </p>
<p>First, “the nations” that “will walk by its light” will also bring their glory </p>
<p>and honor . . . into it. What John may have specically intended by </p>
<p>this is mostly guesswork on our part, but the implication seems to be </p>
<p>that part of the glory of the city will lie not with the unceasing imports </p>
<p>being brought into it; rather, everything that would already give any city </p>
<p>glory is now to be transferred to the nal great city that has come down </p>
<p>from heaven to earth. Second, and especially signicant, the city exists </p>
<p>only for those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life (on </p>
<p>which see on 3:5 above), God’s own people who once more are set o </p>
<p>in stark contrast to others, who are designated in this case as anyone </p>
<p>who does what is shameful or deceitful, thereby covering a multitude </p>
<p>of sins. In so doing, John once more echoes the Prophets of Israel, this </p>
<p>time Isaiah 52:1 (“Put on your garments of splendor, Jerusalem, the </p>
<p>holy city; the uncircumcised and deled will not enter you again”).</p>
<p>A New Earth: Eden Restored (22:1–5)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>en the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear </p>
<p>as crystal, owing from the throne of God and of the Lamb </p>
<p>2</p>
<p>down </p>
<p>the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of the river </p>
<p>stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit </p>
<p>every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the </p>
<p>nations. </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>No longer will there be any curse. e throne of God and </p>
<p>of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will serve him. </p>
<p>17. I am here reminded of my younger days, during the rst months of America’s </p>
<p>entering WWII, when my father was a pastor in a West Coast harbor town at the </p>
<p>entry to the state of Washington’s Puget Sound. Blackouts were common in those early </p>
<p>months, well patrolled by volunteers, one of whom knocked on our door insisting that </p>
<p>my parents douse the little 2-watt light on the bottom of our oor lamp, whose light he </p>
<p>could detect through our drawn window shades in such utter darkness.</p>
