<p>e Defeat of the Dragon in Heaven</p>
<p>173</p>
<p>Psalm 96:11:</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>erefore, rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in</p>
<p>them! But this call and its following woe are John’s way of playing out </p>
<p>the content of the preceding two sentences (vv. 10 and 11) in terms of </p>
<p>the “already but not yet” nature of Christ’s victory over Satan. He begins </p>
<p>with the response in heaven because of what was articulated in verse 10, </p>
<p>that “salvation has come” and “the accuser” of God’s people “has been </p>
<p>hurled down.” But that also leads, secondly, to a woe to the earth and </p>
<p>the sea, because the devil has gone down to you, thus picking up and </p>
<p>repeating the content of verse 9. e reason for the woe is simple: Satan </p>
<p>is full of fury over his defeat evidenced by the resurrection;</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>and thus</p>
<p>he knows his time is short, which means that there are many more </p>
<p>who will have to “sail through bloody seas.”</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>We should note nally that the phrase “his time is short” has </p>
<p>caused no little concern to those of God’s people who live some nine-</p>
<p>teen centuries aer these words were written. But this is a case where </p>
<p>“short” is in the eye of the beholder, as it were, for here an adverb that </p>
<p>ordinarily means “brief ” is most likely intended to indicate “limited,” </p>
<p>with emphasis not so much on its brevity as on the fact that Satan’s </p>
time has divinely set limits. In any case John’s immediate concern is
<p>that Satan is not omniscient, as God alone is. What Satan knows is that </p>
<p>God has set boundaries to his time, and thus his “fury” is about to be </p>
<p>poured out on the generations that succeed John’s. And that is what will </p>
<p>be played out dramatically in the scene that follows.</p>
<p>The Dragon Pursues God’s People on Earth (12:13–17)</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, </p>
<p>he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>e woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she </p>
<p>might y to the place prepared for her in the wilderness, where she </p>
<p>would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the </p>
<p>12. at this is a genuine echo of the Psalm at this point seems to be made certain </p>
<p>by the fact that John concludes, “and all that is in it,” which, though spoken about the </p>
<p>sea in the psalm, is what makes sense of this otherwise unnecessary phrase in John’s </p>
<p>narrative.</p>
<p>13. As an African-American pastor in New York City put it once in an Easter ser-</p>
<p>mon, by way of a “telephone call” between Hell and the Grave, with the latter calling to </p>
<p>the former, “He got away! He got away! And he’s got the keys! He’s got the keys!”</p>
<p>14. Language taken from Isaac Watts’s hymn, “Am I a Soldier of the Cross.”</p>
