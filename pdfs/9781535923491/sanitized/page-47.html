<p>To the Church in Ephesus</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>As with each of the letters, this one begins with the phrase these </p>
<p>are the words of him who, which is then followed by a descriptor, </p>
<p>taken in most cases from some part of the preceding imagery of Christ </p>
<p>in 1:13–16. In this rst instance Christ is presented by a combination of </p>
<p>language from 1:16 (him who holds the seven stars in his right hand) </p>
<p>and 1:13 (and walks among the seven golden lampstands), which </p>
<p>would appear to be the most basic way Christ could be described when </p>
<p>using terms from the preceding vision. e “seven angels” are thus un-</p>
<p>der Christ’s own absolute authority (in his right hand); and he himself </p>
<p>is present among the churches to whom he now has John write on his </p>
<p>behalf.</p>
<p>is is followed immediately by a considerable expression of praise </p>
<p>for the church, praise that has three dimensions to it, all of which in </p>
<p>the Greek text are introduced by the main verb I know. e rst thing </p>
<p>Christ knows, and thus reveals about them, is a more general depic-</p>
<p>tion of praise, expressed in three basic parts (in what evolves into a </p>
<p>considerably convoluted sentence</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>). First, he commends them for their </p>
<p>deeds,</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>which as a plural is probably to be understood as the general</p>
<p>(catch-all) term. is is then spelled out as having two dimensions to </p>
<p>it: your hard work and your perseverance. “Work” in this case most </p>
<p>likely refers to every form of labor that directly involves ministry (= </p>
<p>service to others) of any kind, while “perseverance” means that they </p>
<p>have not agged in doing so.</p>
<p>At least that is what John himself seems to intend when he spells </p>
<p>out their “deeds” in a second clause that is dependent on the main verb, </p>
<p>“I know.” When elaborated with a bit of detail, their “work” in this case </p>
<p>basically has to do with rejecting false teachers. at is, the Lord’s pri-</p>
<p>mary concern, and thus John’s ultimate concern, is with the gospel as </p>
<p>such, which in the Johannine corpus refers not simply to its theological </p>
<p>content, but also to the way people live in the world on the basis of </p>
<p>that content. us, when the “deeds” for which they are commended </p>
<p>are elaborated, they have to do with contending for the truth of the </p>
<p>2. All of vv. 2–3 is one long sentence in Greek, held together by several kai’s (“and”), </p>
<p>which function in dierent ways. us, “I know . . . and that you . . . and you have </p>
<p>found . . . and you have persevered and endured hardships.”</p>
<p>3. e phrase “I know your deeds” will recur in the nal four letters as well; this is </p>
<p>altered only in the letters to Smyrna (“I know your aictions and your poverty”) and </p>
<p>to Pergamum (“I know where you live”).</p>
