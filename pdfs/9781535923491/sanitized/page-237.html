<p>Prelude: e Seven Angels with the Last Plagues </p>
<p>215</p>
<p>again echoes language from an Old Testament theophany, in this case </p>
<p>Isaiah 6:4, where in that great revelation of God Isaiah notes rst that </p>
<p>“the whole earth is full of [Yahweh’s] glory,” and then that “the temple </p>
<p>was lled with smoke.” e heavenly “temple,” which in this picture </p>
<p>seems not to be heaven itself, thus takes on the aura of untouchable </p>
<p>holiness, like that associated with the interior of the original temple </p>
<p>in Judaism. In this case, however, entry is not based on worthiness or </p>
<p>“clean or unclean,” but, in anticipation of what comes next in John’s </p>
<p>narrative. us, in a gurative sense John sees all heaven as standing </p>
<p>still until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed. As </p>
<p>has been frequently pointed out, one takes this language literally only at </p>
<p>great cost, missing altogether John’s own point in this introduction: that </p>
<p>what follows is to be read with a sense of holy awe.</p>
<p>The Seven Bowls Are Poured Out (16:1–21)</p>
<p>ere can be little question that with the nal set of seven which oc-</p>
<p>curs next, John has deliberately chosen to echo both Israel’s rst and </p>
<p>second exodus—the original one from Egypt and the second one from </p>
<p>Babylon. As with the preceding sets, this one also comes in a series of </p>
<p>4-2-1, with a twofold interlude between the sixth and seventh. But in </p>
<p>this case, one also meets two unusual features: a rather long armation </p>
of the divine justice in these judgments aer the third bowl (vv. 5–7);
<p>and an especially brief interlude in verses 15 and 16, which happens so </p>
<p>quickly, as it were, that the reader can easily mistake these clauses as </p>
<p>part of the sixth bowl itself. But as with all else in this book, nothing is </p>
<p>without purpose, so at issue in part for the interpreter is to seek expla-</p>
<p>nations for these two unusual moments—especially with regard to the </p>
<p>rst—while at the same time pursuing the role of the entire passage in </p>
<p>the larger narrative.</p>
<p>e First Four Bowls (16:1–9)</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>en I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven an-</p>
<p>gels, “Go, pour out the seven bowls of God’s wrath on the earth.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>e rst angel went and poured out his bowl on the land, and </p>
<p>ugly, festering sores broke out on the people who had the mark of </p>
<p>the beast and worshiped its image.</p>
