city; but its ultimate purpose from the divine perspective was to serve
<p>as a means “to test you.” at it is said this persecution will last for ten </p>
<p>days is to be understood as indicating that it would be for a limited time </p>
<p>only.</p>
<p>at the threat was a real one, full of imminent danger, is made </p>
<p>certain by the nal admonition: Be faithful, even to the point of death. </p>
<p>As we know from the letters of both Ignatius and Polycarp, these were </p>
<p>not idle warnings for the Smyrnan believers. Already toward the end of </p>
<p>the rst Christian century John recognized that the warnings of Jesus </p>
<p>regarding his disciples were moving toward their fulllment in this </p>
<p>sector of the Empire in the province of Asia. While this is easy for us </p>
<p>to see from hindsight, John was “in the Spirit” (1:10), which made it </p>
<p>possible for him to see with foresight. So the Lord urges faithfulness on </p>
<p>them, because the ultimate result of such faithfulness comes from him: </p>
<p>I will give you life as your victor’s crown—thus reecting the warfare </p>
<p>imagery that permeates the whole of the Revelation. From one perspec-</p>
<p>tive this might seem like a strange thing to say to those who were cur-</p>
<p>rently alive, but in fact it is written from the perspective of what was </p>
<p>about to happen to them. And since Christ had identied himself as </p>
<p>the one “who died and came to life again,” their “victor’s crown” was </p>
<p>his to give!</p>
<p>e letter then concludes with the same admonition found in the </p>
<p>preceding letter, and in all the subsequent ones: Whoever has ears, let </p>
<p>them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. Also as before, the </p>
<p>nal promise is expressed in language appropriate to the content of the </p>
<p>letter itself. As always, those who are victorious is a reference to God’s </p>
<p>people, now based on Christ’s triumph noted at the outset (“who died </p>
<p>and came to life again”). In this case they are promised they will not be </p>
<p>hurt at all by the second death, a reference to the eschatological future </p>
<p>of those who have rejected Christ, which is spelled out in plain terms in </p>
<p>20:14 (“the lake of re is the second death”). As always in this book, this </p>
<p>is a promise intended for all its readers who remain faithful to Christ.</p>
