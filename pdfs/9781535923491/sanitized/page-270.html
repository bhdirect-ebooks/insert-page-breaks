<p>Revelation 18:1—19:10</p>
<p>248</p>
<p>We would have healed Babylon,</p>
<p> but she cannot be healed;</p>
<p>Let us leave her and each go to our own land,</p>
<p> for her judgment reaches to the skies,</p>
<p> it rises as high as the heavens.</p>
<p>us not only is the nature of Rome’s sins enormous, so also is their </p>
<p>quantity; they “are piled up” so as to reach the dwelling of the living </p>
<p>God, with the result that God has remembered her crimes. is is the </p>
<p>language of poetry, of course. It is not that God could not see all the </p>
<p>evil in Rome; rather, expressing it in the manner of the Old Testament </p>
<p>prophets, John is announcing that God in fact will do something about </p>
<p>them, which is what “God remembers” language most oen means in </p>
<p>the Prophets.</p>
<p>What happens next in the lament tends to catch the reader a bit o </p>
<p>guard. For suddenly there is a call to her executioners to come forward </p>
<p>with a form of the lex taliones (“an eye for an eye”), but with double </p>
<p>measure. e suddenness of this call is explicable in part in light of </p>
<p>the oracle from which John seems to be borrowing, Jeremiah 50:8–16, </p>
<p>which begins like this one with a call to Israel’s captives to ee from </p>
Babylon (v. 8). is is followed immediately by a divine marshaling of
<p>the nations to judge her (vv. 9–10), who in verses 14–16 are directly </p>
<p>spoken to, as in our text, and which contains the command: “Since this </p>
<p>is the vengeance of the Lord, take vengeance on her; do to her as she </p>
<p>has done to others” (v. 15). It is this kind of context, then, in which one </p>
should hear the divine summons that appears in John’s version.
<p>us, and probably with the forces in view mentioned in the pre-</p>
<p>ceding 17:16–17, the summons begins, Give back to her [Rome] as she </p>
<p>has given. en, to strengthen the force of God’s judgments against </p>
<p>her for her crimes against God’s own people, the call is to pay her back </p>
<p>double for what she has done. is is then reinforced by a straight-</p>
<p>forward echo of 17:4 and 6, where “the harlot” is said to be holding </p>
<p>“a golden cup in her hand, lled with abominable things and the lth </p>
<p>of her adulteries,” to which is then added that “the woman was drunk </p>
<p>with the blood of God’s people, the blood of those who bore testimony </p>
to Jesus.” Now the divine voice calls out to pour her a double portion
<p>from her own cup, which seems to be a straightforward echo, but now </p>
with specic content, of Jeremiah 50:15 noted above. e divine sum-
<p>mons then concludes with a striking spelling out of what this means, </p>
