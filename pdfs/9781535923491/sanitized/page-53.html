<p>To the Church in Smyrna</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>e third item in the list of Christ’s “knowing” these suering </p>
<p>believers</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> has to do with the verbal abuse (slander) they have experi-</p>
<p>enced, especially from the (apparently) privileged Jewish community in </p>
<p>their city. Since John is himself a Jew, and given that his fellow Jews do </p>
<p>not fare well in his Gospel either, his language regarding them here is </p>
<p>especially strong—but not anti-Semitic, as some of his detractors would </p>
<p>claim. From the perspective of Christ, crucied and risen, those who </p>
<p>belong to the same Jewish worldview that rejected Christ historically </p>
<p>are not true Jews; rather they are now to be understood as those who </p>
<p>say they are Jews and are not. at much is easy enough to handle; </p>
<p>the more dicult clause is the concluding one: but are a synagogue of </p>
<p>Satan.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Although this pronouncement sounds especially harsh when</p>
<p>heard by modern ears, it is not intended by John to be derogatory, but to </p>
<p>represent the present reality in Smyrna. What seems certain from John’s </p>
<p>sentence is that the Jewish community had taken the lead in whatever </p>
<p>had happened to bring about the believers’ “aictions and . . . poverty.” </p>
<p>is is anti-Semitic only to those who read the Gospel accounts of Jesus </p>
<p>and his disciples, themselves Jews, in a presuppositional way.</p>
<p>e risen Christ’s response to those who are about to suer for him </p>
<p>in Smyrna is not especially encouraging in itself, as the next two sen-</p>
<p>tences make plain. First, he enjoins them, do not be afraid of what you </p>
<p>are about to suer, thus making clear that their suering was both an </p>
<p>inevitable and immediate result of their being followers of the Crucied </p>
<p>One. Second, he spells out the nature of their on-the-horizon suering: </p>
<p>the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, language that is </p>
<p>full of theological grist, even as it spells out the harsh realities of what </p>
<p>awaits these particular believers. Not one to yell “devil” (as in “the devil </p>
<p>made me do it”) at every occurrence of evil, John nevertheless recog-</p>
<p>nizes that lying behind the evil that persists in Smyrna is “our ancient </p>
<p>foe, who seeks to work us woe.” e nature of the persecution will be </p>
<p>imprisonment, whatever that would have meant at that time in such a </p>
<p>8. In John’s Greek there is no new sentence here; it simply reads, “I know your af-</p>
<p>ictions and poverty—but you are rich—and the slander from the so-called Jews . . .”</p>
<p>9. is is the rst of 17 occurrences of this name for the devil; see further 2:13, 24; </p>
<p>3:9; 12:9 (where he is further identied as “the ancient serpent called the devil”); 20:2 </p>
<p>and 7. e name occurs elsewhere in the NT only in Acts 5:3 and 26:18. e term is a </p>
<p>transliteration into Greek of the Hebrew word that occurs in Job 1:6–8, 12; 2:1–7, and </p>
<p>Zech 3:1–2.</p>
