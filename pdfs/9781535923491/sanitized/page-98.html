<p>Revelation 5:1–4</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>scene is still in heaven; its central features are a scroll with writing on </p>
<p>both sides—which in itself is remarkable, since scrolls were ordinar-</p>
<p>ily written on one side only—and a Lion who is in fact a Lamb, all of </p>
<p>which is full of imagery from the Old Testament. e scene concludes </p>
<p>with three dierent, gradually expanding groups bursting into song, the </p>
<p>central feature of which is the universal praise of the once slain, now </p>
<p>risen Lamb. In many ways the paragraphing of the NIV for this chapter </p>
<p>(vv. 1–5, 6–10, 11–12, 13–14), which basically follows the published </p>
<p>Greek text,</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>reects the ow of the narrative itself. However, if one</p>
<p>reads the narrative in terms of the events as such, then a dierent kind </p>
<p>of paragraphing emerges. In such a reading the vision is in three basic </p>
<p>parts. First, in verses 1–4, as before John puts himself into the narra-</p>
<p>tive; but in this case he plays a much larger role. Even so, at the heart </p>
<p>of things is the sealed scroll, concerning which John weeps because he </p>
<p>instinctively recognizes its signicance; yet there is no one “in heaven </p>
<p>or on earth or under the earth” who is worthy to open the scroll and </p>
<p>reveal its contents. en in verses 5–7 John introduces the Lamb—the </p>
<p>slain Lamb now risen—who is “worthy” to open it.</p>
<p>However, instead of revealing the contents here, John rather, as in </p>
<p>the preceding vision, focuses again on worship, in this case worship of </p>
<p>the Lamb. e rst worshipers are the heavenly entourage described </p>
<p>in the preceding vision—the four living creatures and the twenty-four </p>
<p>elders (vv. 8–10). en in verses 11–12 the Lamb is worshiped by the </p>
<p>entire angelic host, “numbering thousands upon thousands.” At the end </p>
<p>(v. 13) the focus of the worship is expanded to include “the one who </p>
<p>sits on the throne,” while the worshipers are expanded to include “every </p>
<p>creature in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, </p>
<p>and all that is in them.” Finally, the original four living creatures and </p>
<p>twenty-four elders respond with an “Amen” and oer further worship.</p>
<p>e present paragraph thus provides the setting for the dramatic </p>
<p>scenes that follow; and in keeping with the narrative as a whole this </p>
<p>scene is also full of drama. God the Father is once more designated </p>
<p>as him who sat on the throne, the past tense in this case picking up </p>
<p>the thread of the immediately preceding narrative, thus tying the two </p>
<p>10. e Nestle-Aland</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>text also has 4 paragraphs, but in this case vv. 1–5,</p>
<p>6–7, 8–10, 11–14. ese dierences simply indicate that, unlike most places in the </p>
<p>Revelation, the paragraphing here is not immediate to the reader, even though the ow </p>
<p>of the narrative itself is easy to follow.</p>
