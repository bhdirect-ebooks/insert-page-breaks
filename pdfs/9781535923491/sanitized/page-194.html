<p>Revelation 12:7–12</p>
<p>172</p>
<p>activity of accusation, but his current activity against God’s people </p>
<p>on earth, where he “has been hurled down,” having lost his place in </p>
<p>the heavenly realm. So even though the decisive battle won by Christ </p>
<p>through his death and resurrection guarantees the outcome of the war, </p>
<p>nal salvation, though guaranteed, is in fact “not yet.” us the war it-</p>
<p>self is not over, even though victory has already been fully and nally </p>
<p>decided. So in one of the key moments in the book—not to mention in </p>
<p>the whole New Testament—the “already but not yet” of the believers’ </p>
<p>present existence is spelled out in the two key clauses of this sentence. </p>
<p>First, and returning to the language of warfare, John relates that they </p>
<p>triumphed</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>over him, noting that even in their present existence the</p>
<p>nal outcome is guaranteed. Such a guarantee, of course, rst of all </p>
<p>results from the saving work of Christ (by the blood of the Lamb), </p>
<p>which, second, in this case is nonetheless a guarantee that also requires </p>
<p>participation on the part of Christ’s people, thus and by the word of </p>
<p>their testimony. is, of course, is the dimension that is a call to the </p>
<p>churches themselves to continue to bear witness to Christ, even in the </p>
<p>midst of the coming trial.</p>
<p>en, as a way of summing up the two-sided dimension of their </p>
<p>witness, a witness that has to do primarily with “the blood of the Lamb,” </p>
<p>John notes that the basic stance of those who overcome Satan is that </p>
<p>they did not love their own lives so much as to shrink from death. </p>
<p>ese words stand in oensive contradiction to some contemporary </p>
<p>teaching that for one truly to love others well people must rst of all </p>
<p>love themselves well. Nonetheless the words are not in fact a call to </p>
<p>martyrdom; rather they reect what is to be the basic stance of true fol-</p>
<p>lowers of the Lamb. And as noted before, they are written prophetically </p>
<p>to a church standing on the brink of a holocaust that will periodically </p>
<p>claim the lives of hundreds (probably thousands) over the next two </p>
<p>centuries. And even though it is somewhat easy for those of us who </p>
<p>live nearly two millennia on this side of their coming holocaust to read </p>
<p>these words a bit casually, for them these were the words of a Christian </p>
<p>prophet calling them to endurance and faithfulness.</p>
<p>What follows makes this understanding of John’s call all the more </p>
<p>stark for those of us who read it from afar, and in light of its fulllment </p>
<p>over a two-century period. What one hardly expects is this call, echoing </p>
<p>11. On this key verb (nikao) see n. 5, p. 28 on 2:7 above.</p>
