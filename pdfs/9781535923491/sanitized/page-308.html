<p>Revelation 20:7–10</p>
<p>286</p>
<p>rounded the camp of God’s people. But precisely because the latter are </p>
<p>the city God loves, they will not be destroyed; so re came down from </p>
<p>heaven and devoured them (i.e., the “nations” arrayed against God’s </p>
<p>people). us this great “battle” turns out to be no battle at all, but a </p>
divine victory over “the nations,” whom the devil deceived. So the nal
<p>events of the great eschatological battle entail God’s complete victory </p>
<p>over Satan, who was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the </p>
<p>beast and the false prophet had already been thrown (see 19:20). But </p>
<p>their end is not to be annihilation, but eternal punishment: ey will </p>
<p>thus be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the judgment of Satan is not the whole story; indeed </p>
<p>it is not the primary concern of the story at all. Rather, John’s concern </p>
<p>is with people; rst with those who belong to Christ, and then with all </p>
<p>the rest—those who have chosen to go the way of Satan. So the nal </p>
<p>event is the raising of the dead for judgment, an event that is narrated </p>
<p>at this point so that John can be done altogether with the Evil One and </p>
<p>his followers, and thus move on to narrate the story of the redeemed as </p>
<p>the climax of the book.</p>
<p>Conclusion of the Last Battle: The Raising of the Dead </p>
<p>for Judgment (20:11–15)</p>

<p>en I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. </p>
<p>e earth and the heavens ed from his presence, and there was </p>
<p>no place for them. </p>
<p>12</p>
<p>And I saw the dead, great and small, stand-</p>
<p>ing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was </p>
<p>opened, which is the book of life. e dead were judged according </p>
<p>to what they had done as recorded in the books. </p>
<p>13</p>
<p>e sea gave up </p>
<p>the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead </p>
<p>that were in them, and everyone was judged according to what </p>
<p>they had done. </p>
<p>14</p>
<p>en death and Hades were thrown into the </p>
<p>lake of re. e lake of re is the second death. </p>

<p>All those whose </p>
<p>names were not found written in the book of life were thrown into </p>
<p>the lake of re.</p>
<p>e next (and appropriate) event on the eschatological timetable is the </p>
<p>judgment of the dead, a narrative that begins, typically, with emphasis </p>
<p>on the Judge. us John saw a great white throne and him who was </p>
<p>seated on it. e reason for the throne being described as white is not </p>
<p>altogether clear, except perhaps that it is John’s way of emphasizing the </p>
