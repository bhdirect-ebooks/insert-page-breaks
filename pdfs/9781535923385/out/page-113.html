In this </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y4ea ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws273">regard, it is important to remember the biblical emphasis that the heart is </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y4eb ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws1d9">the heart of the matter<span class="_ _6"></span>. The purity code is given not out of divine caprice, </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y4ec ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws136">but to serve as a concrete reminder of the holiness of God. That code must </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y4ed ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws273">never be understood as a talisman or as something to mask the evil of the </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y4ee ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws246">heart. This is one criticism the prophets made repeatedly (Amos 5:21–27; </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y4ef ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws1e1">Hos 6:6). However<span class="_ _6"></span>, the one who is greater than the prophets has come, and </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y4f0 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws211">brings with him the good news of the kingdom. This addresses the heart to </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y4f1 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws274">which the purity code served as a vivid signpost. When the destination is </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y4f2 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws275">reached the signpost is no longer needed. Or as Paul would put it, things </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y4f3 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws134">pertaining to childhood are put away when one reaches adulthood (1 Cor </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y4f4 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws276">13:11), not because they are bad or shameful but because maturity for </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y4f5 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws245">which childhood is an important preparatory phase is reached. So when the </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y4f6 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws211">evil of the heart is addressed and cured, the ceremonies that point to such </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y4f7 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws24a">a reality are no longer required. The will of God is therefore upheld. Hence, </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y4f8 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws277">Jesus is not teaching that frivolity is the answer to rigid ceremonies, but the </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y4f9 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws133">heart of the matter of these ceremonies must always be kept in mind.
