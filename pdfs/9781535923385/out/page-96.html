This may be construed as a </div><div class="t m0 x2 h23 y343 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws214">political reason. Mark seems to suggest a moral reason instead. But the </div><div class="t m0 x2 h23 y344 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws236">two may be harmonized without great difﬁculty<span class="_ _2"></span>, since in Jewish culture </div><div class="t m0 x2 h23 y345 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws237">there is no dichotomy between public ofﬁce and private life, and morality </div><div class="t m0 x2 h23 y346 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws238">is seen to be an inseparable component of politics.
