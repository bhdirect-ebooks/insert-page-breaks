Based on the most ancient </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y3f8 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws209">manuscript testimony (<span class="ffe ws0">א</span> and B, fourth century), the reading Gerasenes </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y3f9 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws1d7">should be preferred over against competitors such as Gadarenes (attested </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y3fa ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws145">by the majority of manuscripts but they are unfortunately late), Gergesenes </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y3fb ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws18a">(few and late) or even the strange Gergystenes (unique to W<span class="_ _2"></span>, ﬁfth century). </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y3fc ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws20a">There is, however<span class="_ _6"></span>, a problem with the earliest reading Gerasenes.

Furthermore, no steep banks may be </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y401 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws20e">found.

Moreover<span class="_ _6"></span>, this city has limits reaching all the way </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y403 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws20f">to the shore. This reading seems to prevail in Matt 8:28.

In terms of topography<span class="_ _2"></span>, Gergesenes </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y3ea ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws210">is the best candidate, that is, if we identify it with the modern day Kursi. </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y406 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws211">This is situated on a plateau, on the east bank of the lake.
