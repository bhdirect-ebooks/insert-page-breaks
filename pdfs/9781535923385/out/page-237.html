He has told his audience in some detail how Jesus’ prediction </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y757 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws180">of his suffering has actually come to pass. There is but one more element </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y758 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws32a">left, and this is the resurrection, which is related in the next story<span class="_ _75"></span>. He </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y759 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws2a1">has also shown in lurid detail the kind of treatment the Son of Man was </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y75a ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws150">subjected to. One could not but recoil at all this and wonder whether it had </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y75b ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws20f">to be the case. However<span class="_ _6"></span>, such suffering is part and parcel of the message of </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y75c ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws1c1">the Christian gospel. The gospel is not about an esoteric experience where </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y75d ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws2da">adherents may be taken away from their troubles. It is about confronting </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y75e ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">problems head-on, without ﬂinching.</div><div class="t m0 xd h23 y75f ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws141">The disciple’<span class="_ _6"></span>s failure has now come to a nadir<span class="_ _6"></span>. It seems that what </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y760 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws1e0">Jesus has attempted to do by gathering a group of people and teaching them </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y761 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws32b">has come to naught. However<span class="_ _6"></span>, there is a small glimmer of hope. Against </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y762 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws1da">this depressing picture, Mark tells us there were faithful women disciples </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y763 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws272">who were at the cruciﬁxion and bore witness to all that was done. Indeed, a </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y764 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws32c">member of the Sanhedrin by the name of Joseph of Arimathea came forward </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y3ec ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws18f">to ask what may be regarded as a request that could jeopardize his political </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y765 ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws1bf">career<span class="_ _6"></span>.

Just as Jesus was the last envoy to sum up all the </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y76a ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws245">prophetic overtures made to Israel, so he also summed up all the sufferings </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y76b ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws1bc">of the righteous. What Scripture relates, even when it is about the most </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y76c ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws326">unjust suffering, is truly about the Son of Man. In this regard, Mark recounts </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y76d ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws32e">a detail that has puzzled so many: the cry of dereliction taken from Ps 22:1. </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y76e ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws2dd">This is not to be understood merely as a desperate or hopeless cry<span class="_ _75"></span>.
