The end-time restoration is to be </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y21c ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws1dd">achieved by the powerful work of the eschatological Spirit, who is also the </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y21d ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws1de">agent of cleansing, revelation and regeneration (Isa 32:14–20; 59:15–21; </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y21e ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws1dc">Ezek 36:24–36; 37:1–14; 39:21–29). Without his work, restoration could </div><div class="t m0 x1 h23 y21f ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws1b9">not occur and Israel would be regarded as being still in her sins.
