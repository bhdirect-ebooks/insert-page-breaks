The rich theological terms of yesteryears, </div><div class="t m0 x2 h23 y21c ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws13c">or from a far country<span class="_ _2"></span>, would simply pass our generation by if we do not make </div><div class="t m0 x2 h23 y21d ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws13d">the effort to connect.

This is the reference point. As such </div><div class="t m0 x2 h23 y22b ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws141">it serves as a challenge to how the gospel is being presented today<span class="_ _2"></span>. We </div><div class="t m0 x2 h23 y22c ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws147">may mention here, as an example, the weekly sermons of some churches </div><div class="t m0 x2 h23 y22d ff6 fs15 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws148">where the focus is on how their members may be healthy or wealthy<span class="_ _2"></span>.
