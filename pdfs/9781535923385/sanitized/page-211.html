<p>Excursus: e Chronology of the Last Supper in the Four Gospels 193</p>
<p>the 14th of Nisan). The sacriﬁcing of lambs took place on the afternoon of </p>
<p>the 14th of Nisan, so that in the evening (i.e., 15th of Nisan), the Passover </p>
<p>meal may be held. This allows us to ﬁt Mark’s chronology with John’s, which </p>
<p>clearly states that Jesus dies on the day the lambs are sacriﬁced (i.e., af-</p>
<p>ternoon of 14th of Nisan). All this means that Jesus held the meal a day </p>
<p>in advance of the ofﬁcial one. There are good reasons for this: to throw his </p>
<p>enemies off his trail, and to fulﬁll his vocation of being sacriﬁced like the </p>
<p>Passover lamb for the new covenant.</p>
<p>e Preparation for the Meal (14:12–16)</p>
<p>Verse 12 gives us a time note again—the rst day of the Festival of Unleav-</p>
<p>ened Bread—and even species this to be the day the Passover lambs are to </p>
<p>be sacriced, indicating that Mark is stressing the backdrop against which </p>
<p>his readers are to understand the Last Supper. We have previously com-</p>
<p>mented on the link between the Unleavened Bread festival and Passover. </p>
<p>Suce it here to reiterate that. Quite plausibly, it is in the evening of the 14th </p>
<p>of Nisan, and not the aernoon of the next solar day (still 14th of Nisan) </p>
<p>that the question of the disciples was asked.</p>
<p>e instructions of Jesus in vv. 13–15 suggest some prior arrangements </p>
<p>have been made, and with pre-arranged signals agreed upon for security </p>
<p>and secrecy. Mark also tells his audience this meal is held in a big upper </p>
<p>room (v. 15).</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>e Meal and the Interpretative Words (14:17–26)</p>
<p>Two key moments in the meal may be identied: rst, the prediction that a </p>
<p>member of the Twelve will betray Jesus (vv. 18–21), and secondly, the giving </p>
<p>of interpretative words over the key elements in the meal, transforming a </p>
<p>time-hallowed meal into something new (vv. 22–25).</p>
<p>During the meal Jesus takes the initiative to inform the Twelve of </p>
<p>his impending betrayal. e words “one who is eating with me” (v. 18) are </p>
<p>shocking in the ancient context because they indicate great betrayal. Par-</p>
<p>taking of a meal together is oen symbolic of intimacy or reconciliation. </p>
<p>Indeed, such words also echo the Psalmist’s complaint in Ps 41:9 of being </p>
<p>136. Swete 1898: 330 argues that the room would have been carpeted and the </p>
<p>couches upholstered.</p>
