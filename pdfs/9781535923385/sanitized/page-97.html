<p>Excursus: Mark and Josephus on John the Baptist 79</p>
<p>Tetrarch (although Luke does in Luke 3:1, but he does not name the ﬁrst </p>
<p>husband of Herodias!) and whenever Josephus refers to Philip, it is always </p>
<p>Philip the Tetrarch. To make matters worse, Josephus informs us that Philip </p>
<p>the Tetrarch was married to Salome, the daughter of Herodias and Herod </p>
<p>(Antiquities 18:136)! In the light of all this evidence, some scholars who </p>
<p>give pre-eminence to Josephus’s account, think that Mark was confused in </p>
<p>naming Herodias’s ﬁrst husband as Philip. But this is unwarranted, as ﬁrst </p>
<p>of all, Herod the Great’s family tree is actually quite complicated. Moreover, </p>
<p>“Herod” can be a personal name or a family name in Josephus’s account. </p>
<p>There is no reason why the ﬁrst husband of Herodias could not have more </p>
<p>than one name. A simpliﬁed family tree of Herod the Great, derived from J. </p>
<p>Marcus, may make all this clear:</p>

<p>died AD 34 </p>
<p>= marriage </p>
<p>What was exactly the reason for John the Baptist’s opposition to Antipas’s </p>
marriage to Herodias (v. 18)? It was not because it entailed Herod’s divorc-
<p>ing his rst wife. Divorces were allowed under Jewish law (Deut 24:1–4). </p>
Nor was it because Herodias, a woman, had initiated divorce proceedings.
<p>She did not have that right under Jewish law, but it was permissible under </p>
<p>133. Marcus 2000: 394.</p>
