<p>e Kingdom of God 231</p>
<p>seed that is planted in the ground. All this must not be taken to mean that </p>
<p>for Jesus the kingdom remains as seed. No, it will grow. And the smallest </p>
<p>of seeds will become the largest of plants. e glory of the consummation </p>
<p>far outstrips the glory of the inauguration. e hiddenness of the kingdom </p>
<p>dovetails with the hiddenness of Jesus’ identity.</p>
<p>Kingdom proclamation and activity is intimately linked to exorcism, </p>
<p>a prominent theme in Mark which is unfortunately seldom examined.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e importance of this motif is seen in that the rst miraculous and awe-</p>
<p>inspiring deed Jesus performs aer his announcement of the kingdom’s im-</p>
<p>minence is an exorcism. Furthermore, this exorcism is intentionally labelled </p>
<p>as a piece of new teaching with authority (1:27). e calling of the Twelve </p>
<p>and the sending of them for mission are explicitly linked with such a theme. </p>
<p>e rst mentioned role of the apostles is that of preaching and having au-</p>
<p>thority over demons (3:15; cf. 6:7). eir kingdom proclamation involves </p>
<p>exorcistic activity. e important passage of Mark 3:20–30 further supports </p>
<p>the signicance of exorcism. Jesus defends his exorcism by using images </p>
<p>that speak of the kingdom. Indeed, misunderstanding Jesus’ exorcisms may </p>
<p>make one liable for committing the eternal sin.</p>
<p>It must also be pointed out that Jesus is depicted not just as the pro-</p>
<p>claimer of the kingdom, but he also embodies it.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>To reject one is to reject</p>
<p>the other (8:38). is theme is deeply embedded in the Passion narrative. </p>
<p>e “vow of abstinence” (14:25) may be understood as speaking of Jesus’ </p>
<p>central role in the realization and consummation of the kingdom. His death </p>
<p>does not mean the kingdom’s project is derailed. In a paradoxical way, it is </p>
<p>essential to its completion. is dovetails with the Markan motif of the ne-</p>
<p>cessity of Jesus’ going to Jerusalem to be crucied (8:31; 9:31–32; 10:33–34).</p>
<p>Finally, something must be said about this kingdom theme and the </p>
<p>situation of Mark’s rst readers, where imperial power and propaganda were </p>
<p>prominent. Mark encourages them to think along this line: the kingdom </p>
<p>message of Jesus subverts the imperial propaganda of Rome.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>is is seen</p>
<p>to be at work already in the very rst verse, and climaxing at 15:39, where a </p>
<p>centurion, who is under Rome’s employ proclaims the crucied Jesus as the </p>
<p>20. But see recently, Evans 2009: 151–79; and Iwe 1999. Cf. Käsemann 1969: 58, </p>
<p>where he argues for the importance of exorcism for understanding eschatology and </p>
<p>Christology.</p>
<p>21. Allison 2010: 245–47 observes that God is seldom explicitly called king in the </p>
<p>Synoptic Tradition, despite the fact that sayings relating to the Kingdom are plentiful. </p>
<p>is phenomenon stands in stark contrast with the OT. What may explain this is that </p>
<p>Jesus is intentionally portrayed as the king of the eschatological kingdom.</p>
<p>22. See the provocative treatment on the clash between Jesus’ message and the im-</p>
<p>perial propaganda in Horsley 2002.</p>
