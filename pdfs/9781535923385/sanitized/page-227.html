<p>Excursus: Pontius Pilate 209</p>
<p>Caesarea Maritima but during the Passover and other important festivals, </p>
<p>he would reside in Jerusalem for assizes, and to ensure peace and security </p>
<p>during such heady times. He was a protégé of Sejanus, the commander of </p>
<p>the Praetorian Guard (the Emperor’s special troops), who was inﬂuential on </p>
<p>the Emperor Tiberius. Unfortunately, Sejanus was anti-Semitic, and such </p>
<p>an attitude would certainly have inﬂuenced his protégé. From two extant </p>
<p>Jewish sources (Josephus Antiquities 18:55–62; Philo’s Embassy to Gaius </p>
<p>299–305), Pilate appears to be a rather insensitive ruler who despised the </p>
<p>Jews. Apart from the incident alluded in Luke 13:1, two other incidents </p>
<p>bear mentioning for they typify the kind of attitude Pilate had towards the </p>
<p>Jews.</p>
<p>The ﬁrst may be known as the “standards incident.” Roman stan-</p>
<p>dards bearing the Emperor’s image were brought into Jerusalem, rousing </p>
<p>the ire of the Jewish populace because they regarded them as idolatrous </p>
<p>and therefore deﬁling to a holy city such as Jerusalem. Military force was </p>
<p>used to quell the Jewish protest, but to no avail as the Jews willingly bared </p>
<p>their necks before the soldiers’ swords. They would rather die than to have </p>
<p>the city deﬁled. Sensing that a massacre could easily ignite a revolution, </p>
<p>Pilate backed down and withdrew the standards (Josephus War 2:169–74; </p>
<p>Antiquities 18:55–59).</p>
<p>In the second incident, Pilate took Corban funds from the Temple trea-</p>
<p>sury to build an aqueduct to carry water into Jerusalem. Although the project </p>
<p>would bring practical beneﬁts to the Jews, the use of such sacred funds was </p>
<p>deemed highly offensive for they were dedicated to God. There was a mas-</p>
<p>sacre this time round (Josephus War 2:175; Antiquities 18:60–62). The </p>
<p>two incidents probably took place before Jesus was arraigned before him.</p>
<p>183</p>
<p>As it is expedient for overlords to win over the goodwill of the subjects, </p>
<p>certain forms of amnesty are sometimes given, especially in the context of </p>
<p>national or religious festivals.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p>So Mark informs us it is a Roman practice</p>
<p>to release a prisoner requested by the Jewish people during the Feast of the </p>
<p>Unleavened Bread (cf.m. Pes. 8.6).e Jewish crowd duly ask for a prisoner </p>
<p>to be released (v. 8; but do note that Mark’s narrative is compressed here; he </p>
<p>Emperor to take charge mainly of civil or criminal matters, while a procurator’s sphere </p>
<p>of responsibility was mainly scal in nature.</p>
