<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>4:1–3456</p>
<p>stock image for describing the indels or the wicked in Jewish literature (Sir </p>
<p>23:25; 40:15; Wis 4:3).</p>
<p>e third type of terrain contains thorns. Due to competition from the </p>
<p>thorns, the sown seed cannot reach its full potential of bearing fruit. Jer 4:3 </p>
<p>warns against sowing among thorns in his sermon encouraging repentance </p>
<p>and return.</p>
<p>e nal terrain is good soil, which yields great results. e enu-</p>
<p>meration of the yields is interesting. If taken as crop yields they are indeed </p>
<p>phenomenal, since usual yields were less than tenfold. Even so, this pales </p>
<p>in comparison with the exaggerated expectations of the fruitfulness of the </p>
<p>eschaton by the rabbis, where yields can be as much as 150,000 times (b. </p>
<p>Ketub.11b-12a)! e point is that great fruitfulness, a symbol of the eschaton </p>
<p>(Jer 31:12; Hos 2:21–22; Joel 2:22; Amos 9:13; Zech 8:12), has come.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>But</p>
if it is taken as the yield of the individual seed, the description is realistic.
<p>88</p>
<p>Verse 9 harks back to the “Listen” of v. 3, and together they form a </p>
<p>frame for the parable. e saying also serves two functions. First, it makes </p>
<p>the parable applicable to all, with the words “those who have ears.” But sec-</p>
<p>ondly, “those who have ears to hear” suggests that not everyone uses his/her </p>
<p>auditory organs properly, and in this respect the exhortation is narrowed to </p>
<p>a special group. e two ideas are not mutually exclusive. All are summoned </p>
<p>to hear but it is implied that not all will do so.</p>
<p>e Meaning of the Parable (4:10–25)</p>
<p>is section may be broken up into three units. e rst (vv. 10–12) tells us </p>
<p>why Jesus explains the parables only to his disciples and not to the crowds or </p>
<p>“outsiders.” is sets the stage for the second unit (vv. 13–20), which reiter-</p>
<p>ates the importance of the parable of the sower, and also decodes for the </p>
<p>disciples the meaning of the dierent images in the parable. e third (vv. </p>
<p>21–25) comprises four dierent sayings: two each on the theme of revela-</p>
<p>tion/concealment, and the need to respond appropriately. All this enriches </p>
<p>the meaning of Jesus’ parable teaching by promising ultimate clarity, albeit </p>
<p>with a warning thrown in.</p>
<p>e Purpose of the Parables (4:10–12)</p>
<p>Mark probably envisages a group larger than the Twelve in v. 10 (cf. 2:15). </p>
<p>e plural “parables” is intentional, and not a result of poor composition. </p>
<p>87. Cf. Jeremias 1954: 150.</p>
<p>88. White 1964: 301–3; Payne 1980: 181–86.</p>
