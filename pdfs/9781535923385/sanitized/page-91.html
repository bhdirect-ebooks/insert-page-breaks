<p>e Rejection at Nazareth 73</p>
<p>Mark does not name the town, but given the toponym in 1:9 and 1:24, </p>
<p>we may with justication conclude that it is Nazareth. Interestingly, this is </p>
<p>the only story in Mark that is located in Nazareth.</p>
<p>e story is set on a Sabbath day, with Jesus teaching in a synagogue (v. </p>
<p>2). is may be construed as the community’s wishing to honor him. Or it is </p>
<p>for them to hear for themselves his message that has brought him acclaim in </p>
<p>other towns and villages. As it is also true in previous episodes, Jesus’ teach-</p>
<p>ing amazes his own townspeople. But what appears to be a positive note </p>
<p>actually contains latent misgivings. Words of wisdom and works of wonder </p>
<p>certainly have astonishing qualities (these are associated with the ideal Da-</p>
<p>vidic ruler or Messiah; cf. Isa 11:2; Pss Sol 17:23), but what Jesus’ townsfolk </p>
<p>cannot accept is that these are coming from someone they know. Astonish-</p>
<p>ing claims and familiar neighbors are not allowed to coexist in the minds </p>
<p>of many people, especially for an ancient Semitic village where everyone </p>
<p>supposedly knew everybody.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>Jesus is known to them simply as the son</p>
<p>of Mary, and a carpenter at that. e listing of the names of Jesus’ siblings </p>
<p>serves to emphasize this familiarity (v. 3). Incidentally, all this means Jesus </p>
<p>could not have performed many miracles before his public ministry, other-</p>
<p>wise the amazement of the people would not have made much sense. is </p>
<p>contradicts many childhood stories of Jesus in the apocryphal gospels.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>e above reconstruction of what could have led to Jesus’ rejection </p>
<p>by his own townspeople is given conrmation by Jesus’ own assessment of </p>
<p>the problem bedeviling all this skepticism (v. 4). e third person pronoun </p>
<p>is emphasized: “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown, </p>
<p>among his relatives and in his household.” Similar sayings are found in the </p>
<p>cultures surrounding Palestine. Apollonious of Tyana (rst century AD) </p>
<p>remarks that “Until now my own country alone ignores me” (Epistle 44). </p>
<p>e sentiment resonates also with much of the experience of OT prophets. </p>
<p>Stories abound of their rejection by their own people. is allows us an </p>
<p>inroad into another aspect of Jesus’ self-understanding. He aligns himself </p>
<p>with the prophets.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>As the result of unbelief, few miracles are performed (v. 5). Such a </p>
<p>statement should not be taken as an indication that Jesus is powerless to </p>
<p>perform miracles when faith is not present because this makes nonsense </p>
<p>of the miracle of the stilling of the storm in 4:35–41. Mark’s language may </p>
<p>121. Similar sayings are found in the cultures surrounding Palestine. Bultmann </p>
<p>mentions an Arabic proverb that laments, “e piper has no friends in his own town.” </p>
<p>See Bultmann 1963: 31.</p>
<p>122. E.g., the stories in the Protevangelium of James.</p>
<p>123. On the theme of Jesus as a prophet, see the treatment of Allison 1998; and </p>
<p>Keener 2009: 238–55.</p>
