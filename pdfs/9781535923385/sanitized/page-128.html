<p>On the Road to Jerusalem</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>8:22–30110</p>
<p>uses the story to hammer home the point that getting true spiritual insight </p>
<p>is indeed dicult.</p>
<p>e story is set most probably in Bethsaida Julius (vv. 22–23), located </p>
<p>on the northeastern shore of the Sea of Galilee, in a region governed by </p>
<p>Herod Philip. Surprisingly, Bethsaida is called a village,</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> when it was actu-</p>
<p>ally a fortied city in Jesus’ day (Josephus Antiquities 18:28; cf. Matt 11:20). </p>
<p>It has been suggested that Mark may be referring to an outlying settlement </p>
<p>that was joined to the city.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>However, it is more plausible to posit that since</p>
<p>it was only in recent memory that Bethsaida became a fortied city, it might </p>
<p>still be known by many as a village.</p>
<p>Why Jesus takes the blind man outside the village, Mark does not ex-</p>
<p>plain, and we are le to make our own inferences. Since the man will be </p>
<p>commanded later not to enter the village, one may surmise it has something </p>
<p>to do with Bethsaida itself.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>As it was a large fortied city, Jesus may have</p>
<p>wished to avoid publicity yet again. Similar to an earlier story (7:33), Jesus </p>
<p>uses saliva to eect the healing: he spits on the man’s eyes and puts his hand </p>
<p>on him (where exactly, Mark does not tell us).</p>
<p>What the man says may contain a touch of humor (vv. 24–26). ere is </p>
<p>probably no symbolic content in the description; it is given only to illustrate </p>
<p>the indistinct vision the man has. Jesus’ second attempt results in full and </p>
<p>clear vision, as the Greek diablepō indicates.</p>
<p>Scholars suggest this strange episode is a sort of parable, explaining the </p>
<p>spiritual condition of the disciples.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>eir sight has been restored through</p>
<p>Jesus’ gracious call and teaching. ey do indeed see, but only partially. To </p>
<p>see fully, more work needs to be done. is is precisely what the major sec-</p>
<p>tion of 8:22—10:52 seeks to narrate.</p>
<p>e Confession of Peter (8:27–30)</p>
<p>e scene is set in the villages around Caesarea Philippi. It was formerly </p>
<p>named Paneas or Panion in honor of the god Pan. Aer enlarging it, Herod </p>
<p>Philip gave it a new name—Caesarea Philippi—so as to honor Augustus </p>
<p>Caesar. Not surprisingly, the imperial cult (i.e., the worship of Augustus) was </p>
<p>staunchly observed there (Josephus War 1:404–406; Antiquities 15:363–64).</p>
<p>3. e Greek term Mark is kōmē.</p>
<p>4. France 2002: 324; cf. the comment of Hecateus of Abdera that the Jews have only </p>
<p>one fortied city, namely Jerusalem, but many villages (Josephus Against Apion 1:197).</p>
<p>5. Marcus 2009: 598 thinks it is meant to allude to God’s taking Israel by the hand </p>
<p>to lead them out of Egypt (Jer 31:32).</p>
<p>6. Marcus 2009: 601–2; cf. Johnson 1979: 370–83.</p>
