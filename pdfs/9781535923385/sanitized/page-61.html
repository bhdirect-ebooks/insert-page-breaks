<p>lords of the Sabbath.</p>

<p>So this wordplay should be regarded as pointing to</p>
<p>something more signicant. If the Sabbath is made for men, then the di-</p>
<p>vinely appointed ruler of true humanity, who is described as “one who is </p>
<p>like a son of man” in Daniel 7, must have the authority to decide when this </p>
<p>Sabbath regulation may be dispensed with in the wider interest of humanity. </p>
<p>Much has been discussed on the meaning of the Greek connective ōste. It </p>
<p>is possible to regard it as a loose transition.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>Alternatively, we may posit</p>
<p>Mark’s editorial hand is at work here</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>(i.e., he is drawing the conclusion</p>
<p>from the story for his audience).</p>
<p>is second usage of the “Son of Man” phrase gels very well with the </p>
<p>rst (2:10). Twice the phrase is used in connection with prerogatives belong-</p>
<p>ing solely to God: the forgiving of sins, which also mean the transgression of </p>
divine regulations, and the Lord of such regulations, especially the Sabbath.
<p>e “Son of Man” phrase therefore carries very signicant christological </p>
<p>freight for Mark. </p>
<p>Healing on a Sabbath (3:1–6)</p>
<p>e nal controversy story in the cycle is again over the Sabbath, but the </p>
<p>locality is now the synagogue (v. 1). As this is the nal story, Mark makes it </p>
<p>clear that deep animosity has taken root. e religious leaders are no longer </p>
<p>interested in explanations, but are simply looking for a cause to condemn </p>
<p>Jesus (v. 2).</p>
<p>e question of v. 4 is full of irony and, not surprisingly, unanswered. </p>
<p>If one may synthesize from the Mishnah and the Talmud, it may be inferred </p>
<p>that some Jews believed saving lives overrode the Sabbath (m. Yoma 8:6; </p>
<p>b. Yoma 85b). For illnesses which were not life-threatening, however, they </p>
<p>might not be treated (m. Sab. 14:3–4; cf. CD 11:9–10).</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>e Greek behind “stubborn hearts” (v. 5) is pōrōsis tēs kardias, which </p>
<p>is derived from the Hebrew šĕrirût lēb and means literally “hardness of </p>
<p>heart.” is description is typically used of Pharaoh (Exod 4:21; 7:3; 8:32; </p>
<p>14:4), and is oen found in prophetic denunciations of the nation of Judah </p>
<p>just before the exile (Jer 3:17; 7:24; 9:14; 11:8; 13:10; 16:12; cf. Deut 29:18; </p>
<p>Ps 81:15). is description is now applied to Jesus’ opponents. ere is irony </p>
<p>here. e charge of being stubborn and hard-hearted is a typical prophetic </p>
<p>charge against the Israel of old. Now it is applied to those who claimed to </p>
