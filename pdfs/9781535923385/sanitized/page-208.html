<p>e Climax of the Gospel Mark 14:1—15:47190</p>
<p>irdly, the woman’s action points to Jesus’ burial. She recognizes that </p>
<p>Jesus’ messianic ministry must end in death, as it is part and parcel of the </p>
<p>way of the Lord.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>is death is not a tragic accident or something Jesus</p>
<p>must avoid at all costs. Instead it forms the warp and woof of his vocation, </p>
<p>and in this regard is the key ingredient of the gospel. Just as he was anointed </p>
<p>for the messianic task at the beginning of his ministry, so he is now anointed </p>
<p>for the same task at the close of it.</p>
<p>ese points bring us to the climactic statement of this story found </p>
<p>in v. 9. So solemn is this declaration that it is prefaced with “Amen I say to </p>
<p>you.” Wherever the gospel is preached, what she has done must be told in </p>
<p>memory of her. Why should her action earn such a remembrance, and what </p>
<p>is its connection with the gospel? Perhaps the reason is the proigacy of the </p>
<p>woman’s action,</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>which Mark also emphasizes. It mirrors the gospel which</p>
<p>is equally proigate because it speaks of the giving up of the Son of Man for </p>
<p>the ransom of the undeserving many. In the work of the gospel Jesus gives </p>
<p>himself unreservedly; the alabaster box of his life is broken, without any </p>
<p>intention of resealing it. Furthermore, the woman’s action points to Jesus’ </p>
<p>death and burial, even during the lull of a friendly dinner at Simon’s home. </p>
<p>It seems to say that no matter how peaceful the situation may be, Jesus’ </p>
<p>vocation involves his going to the vortex of a “storm” to oer his life. Jesus’ </p>
<p>death on the cross is connected profoundly to the gospel.</p>
<p>e peculiar thing about this episode is that the woman is not named, </p>
<p>even though her action is deeply signicant! e parallel in John provides a </p>
<p>name, which is Mary, the sister of Lazarus; John 12:3. e silence in Mark is </p>
<p>probably due to his desire to put the spotlight on the action and not the per-</p>
<p>son. She is famous only in so far as her action is signicant for the gospel.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>Judas’s departure is a reaction to Jesus’ remark (v. 10). We may specu-</p>
<p>late that it seals for him the belief that Jesus’ messianic program is wrong-</p>
<p>headed and dangerous. It is wrongheaded because it involves death; it is </p>
<p>dangerous because it speaks of God’s proigate love. In this regard, one may </p>
<p>further surmise that behind Judas’s treachery stands a fanatical intent to do </p>
<p>what he thinks is right for the nation.</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>Certainly, Judas’s oering of himself</p>
<p>provides the chief priests with just what they need: someone who can give </p>
<p>124. Hooker 1991: 327–29.</p>
<p>125. Evans 2001: 361–62.</p>
<p>126. Recently, Bauckham 2008: 194–97 has suggested that the silence over the name </p>
<p>was meant for the woman’s protection from the attention of the authorities in the early </p>
<p>years of the church’s existence. is was not needed when the Gospel of John was writ-</p>
ten, and consequently her name might be divulged as Mary of Bethany.
<p>127. Some attempts at rehabilitating the “tainted” character of Judas, but at the ex-</p>
<p>pense of the Early Church, may be found in Klassen 2005.</p>
