<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>12:1–44166</p>
<p>ere is one other tenet which Mark does not mention here, but knowing </p>
<p>it will help us understand why Jesus answers them the way he does. It is </p>
<p>that the Sadducees regard only the rst ve books of Moses (the Torah) </p>
<p>to be authoritative. On this basis they claim that Scripture does not teach </p>
<p>any resurrection of the dead, because the books of Job, Psalms, Isaiah, and </p>
<p>Daniel, with their explicit (Isa 26:19; Dan 12:2) and implicit references (Pss </p>
<p>16:9–11; 49:15; 73:23–26; Job 19:25–26) to resurrection, are certainly not </p>
<p>Scriptures to them. Perhaps one other reason why they do not believe in the </p>
<p>resurrection may be that such a belief destabilizes society. Belief in resur-</p>
<p>rection can fan revolutions as it may embolden people to the point that they </p>
<p>are prepared to give up their lives. In any revolution the reigning powers </p>
<p>stand to lose most.</p>
<p>e Sadducees’ hypothetical situation</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>is based on the law of levirate</p>
<p>marriage (Deut 25:5–10; cf. Gen 38:8). Awidow without issue is constrained </p>
<p>by Torah to marry the brother of the deceased, so that any child born from </p>
<p>this union may then carry on the deceased’s name.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>e point then is that</p>
<p>resurrection creates messy situations, and what is worse, it undermines To-</p>
<p>rah. e woman in obedience to Torah ended up committing polyandry </p>
<p>(marrying seven husbands altogether), which contradicts Torah.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>In this</p>
<p>light, the Sadducees are not just asking a mischievous question to trip Jesus </p>
<p>up, for there are important issues at stake. Between holding to the integrity </p>
<p>of Torah and following a teaching that is normally linked with the Pharisees, </p>
<p>the Sadducees certainly know what they ought to choose.</p>
<p>e Sadducean perspective can only be corrected with good theology </p>
<p>and an appeal to Torah. A quick glance at Jesus’ answer will reveal that he </p>
<p>is doing just that.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>Matching the Sadducean concern for the upholding of</p>
<p>Torah, Jesus answers with a passage from Torah. Matching their correct </p>
<p>assumptions that ridiculous situations should not be contemplated, Jesus </p>
<p>speaks of the power of God. e upshot is that it is the Sadducees’ ignorance </p>
<p>of the Torah and their poor appreciation of God’s power that has landed </p>
<p>them in such an erroneous position. We shall elaborate on these points </p>
<p>below.</p>
<p>To answer the point about the resurrection’s being messy and ridicu-</p>
<p>lous, Jesus speaks of a transformation. e resurrection does not imply a </p>
<p>54. 2 Macc 7 and Tob 3:8, 15 may contain parallels: seven brothers who were mar-</p>
<p>tyred for their faith, and seven bridegrooms. In any case, what is important is not the </p>
<p>putative background but the theological arguments that are being used.</p>
<p>55. Further on this topic see Burrows 1940: 22–33; Westbrook 1991: 68–89. </p>
<p>56. Commentators have not considered the importance of this point.</p>
<p>57. Although Jesus’ view is similar to the Pharisees, there is a major dierence in the </p>
<p>way he establishes the foundations for such a belief.</p>
