<p>Jesus’ Crucixion and Death 211</p>
<p>here is that a condemned man has no more rights le, and soldiers may </p>
<p>do as they please. Oen bored with their vocation or tired of being under </p>
<p>subjection to commanders, soldiers relish the opportunity for comic relief </p>
<p>and venting their pent-up feelings. Commanders allow for this to happen to </p>
<p>keep the troops happy.</p>
<p>188</p>
<p>A mock enthronement ceremony is staged, with</p>
<p>biting sarcasm and bueting blows. Having satised their cruel inclinations, </p>
<p>they dress Jesus now in his own clothes and lead him out to be crucied (v. </p>
<p>20). e chief priests might have been pleased that Jesus was so treated, but </p>
<p>little did they realize it was the entire nation that had been insulted.</p>
<p>Jesus’ Crucifixion and Death (15:21–41)</p>
<p>e climax to which earlier stories looked forward has now arrived. And </p>
<p>with this the distinctive symbol of Christianity is born. Mark therefore </p>
<p>slows his tale down to speak of Jesus’ crucixion and the events surround-</p>
<p>ing it, including the dierent people who are involved or impacted by it. e </p>
<p>listeners of Mark’s tale, if they are steeped in the OT, will certainly be able to </p>
<p>detect many echoes of Psalm 22.</p>
<p>e Crucixion of Jesus (15:21–32)</p>
<p>Just as it was with14:51–52, so we have here a detail not found in any other </p>
<p>Gospel. It is probably included because the characters are well-known to </p>
<p>the rst Markan audience. Simon of Cyrene</p>
<p>189</p>
<p>is compelled to carry the</p>
<p>patibulum (i.e., the crossbeam) for Jesus, presumably because the latter was </p>
<p>too wounded to do so.</p>
<p>190</p>
<p>e whole band of soldiers and criminals come to the place of execu-</p>
<p>tion, which is called Golgotha. is Aramaic word means “the place of the </p>
<p>skull,” as Mark himself informs us (v. 22). Wine mixed with myrrh is oered </p>
<p>to Jesus, for the purpose of numbing the senses to the excruciating pain of </p>
<p>crucixion.In the Babylonian Talmud it is recorded that women, guided by </p>
<p>the teaching of Prov 31:6 would oer wine mixed with frankincense to help </p>
<p>dull the pain of tortured people (b. Sanh. 43a). Perhaps a similar practice is </p>
<p>being performed here. e only dierence is that instead of frankincense </p>
<p>188. As an indication of this see the account in Josephus War 5:450–51, where Titus </p>
<p>allowed his soldiers to do as they pleased to the victims, even though he was supposedly </p>
<p>moved by pity to give them a more humane treatment.</p>
<p>189. e name is Jewish. Cyrene was the capital of Cyrenaica, in which a sizeable </p>
<p>Jewish community was present since the time of Ptolemy I (fourth cent. BC). </p>
<p>190. Marcus 2009: 1041. is datum is missing in John 19:17, which states that </p>
<p>Jesus carried the cross.</p>
