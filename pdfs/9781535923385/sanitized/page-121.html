<p>e Sign and the Yeast 103</p>
<p>One popular hypothesis is that in the former miracle, the numbers 5 </p>
<p>and 12 represent Jewish theological concepts. Five thousand is an intensi-</p>
<p>cation of the number “ve,” and it stands for the ve books of Torah, while </p>
<p>“twelve” is the number of the tribes of Israel. In the present story, the number </p>
<p>“four” stands for the world as it was regarded in ancient times as having four </p>
<p>corners and “seven” is the number of completeness. Together these numbers </p>
<p>stand for the complete worldwide mission of the Messiah. eories of this </p>
<p>nature are dicult to prove or refute, and one wonders whether Mark in-</p>
<p>tends this, and if he did, would his audience have picked it up?</p>
<p>What is clear, though, is that Mark wants his audience to understand </p>
<p>there are two miracle stories of feeding large crowds. He does this for good </p>
<p>reasons. If we were right to conclude that the feeding miracle in Mark 6 </p>
<p>served to demonstrate Jesus as the compassionate eschatological shepherd </p>
<p>who would inaugurate the second exodus for the Jews, then what Mark is </p>
<p>saying by the feeding of the 4,000 is that such an exodus also draws in the </p>
<p>Gentiles. ere is no better place to relate this story, since Mark in chapter 7 </p>
<p>has depicted Jesus as declaring the purity code obsolete.</p>
<p>Mark, therefore, has led his audience on a narrative journey that fea-</p>
<p>tures increasing participation of Gentiles in the benet of the second Exo-</p>
<p>dus Jesus is inaugurating. is is rst adumbrated when the purity code is </p>
<p>made obsolete. So there should be no barriers between Jews and Gentiles, at </p>
<p>least in the area of food. What is theory has to be shown in practice. Hence </p>
<p>following this, Mark goes on to narrate a story which shows that even while </p>
<p>bread is being served to Jews—the children of promise—scraps from the </p>
<p>table may be still be consumed by Gentile dogs there and then. Priority still </p>
<p>belongs to the Jews, but priority does not mean exclusivity. Aer this, Mark </p>
<p>indicates that Gentiles also participate in the blessings of the second Exodus </p>
<p>(i.e., the deaf hear and the mute speak). And nally, the third story in the </p>
<p>sequence provides the climax. ese Gentiles do not just have scraps; they </p>
<p>are also invited to participate at the table of the eschatological shepherd just </p>
<p>as Jews were. ey are fed with the same food and are all satised. Clearly, </p>
<p>the kingdom is also for the Gentiles.</p>
<p>The Sign and the Yeast (8:10–21)</p>
<p>It is best to read the demand for a sign together with the discourse on the </p>
<p>yeast of the Pharisees and of Herod, as a follow-on from the feeding of the </p>
<p>4,000. Once this is done, the placement of these stories will not appear </p>
