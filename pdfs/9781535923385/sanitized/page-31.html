<p>e Heading 13</p>
<p>With regard to the extent of the opening section, we think it ends in </p>
<p>v. 13,</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> as there appears to be a clear break in content and plot with 1:14–</p>
<p>15. ese verses speak of John’s imprisonment—implying the end of one </p>
<p>phase—and introduces Jesus’ message to the readers.</p>
<p>We return to v. 1, especially the meaning of the signicant terms in </p>
<p>their context. e “beginning of the gospel” was certainly a loaded phrase. </p>
<p>A calendar inscription from Priene (9 BC) illuminates this.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>We provide the</p>
<p>English translation of Danker:</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>In her display of concern and generosity on our behalf, Provi-</p>
<p>dence, who orders all our lives, has adorned our lives with the </p>
<p>highest good, namely Augustus … And Caesar, [when he was </p>
<p>manifest], transcended the expectations of [all who had an-</p>
<p>ticipated the good news], not only by surpassing the benets </p>
<p>conferred by his predecessors but by leaving no expectation of </p>
<p>surpassing him to those who would come aer him, with the </p>
<p>result that the birthday of our god signaled the beginning of good </p>
<p>news for the world because of him.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>We can detect some subversion by Mark. e Greek word he uses for “gos-</p>
<p>pel” is euangelion, which was important for the early Church, just as it is for </p>
<p>Christian faith today. It was also important for the Roman Empire, although </p>
<p>it is usually found in the plural form (euangelia). e Christian usage was </p>
<p>always singular. What must not be missed is that the calendar inscription </p>
<p>speaks of the beginning of the euangelia, stating its connection with Augus-</p>
<p>tus Caesar’s birth, calling him a god and proclaiming a universal impact. </p>
<p>Mark connects the beginning of the one gospel with Jesus Christ instead. If </p>
<p>the phrase “Son of God” was original to Mark’s text, there is another point of </p>
<p>contact that may be discerned. We know from other sources that Augustus </p>
<p>Caesar was known as the son of god, aer his adoptive father Julius Caesar </p>
was divinized by the Roman senate. In Mark’s text, Jesus Christ is the Son of
<p>God. Markan subversion is clearly at work.</p>

<p>5. is was previously known as the Priene Inscription. However, copies of this </p>
<p>inscription were found in at least ve cities in Asia Minor, showing how widespread </p>
<p>this piece of propaganda was. Augustus’ reign was widely hailed in Asia Minor because </p>
<p>of his shrewd policies. e economy of the region boomed, and in response the leaders </p>
<p>of these cities proposed to start a new calendar to coincide with Augustus’s birthday. </p>
<p>e beginning of good news in this light meant a new world order. See further Stanton </p>
<p>2004: 9–62, esp. 30–33.</p>
