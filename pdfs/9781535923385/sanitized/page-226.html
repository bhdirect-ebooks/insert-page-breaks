<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>15:1–20208</p>
<p>now comes home to him with full force, as he remembers what Jesus has </p>
<p>predicted (14:30). Greatly disappointed with the failure, Peter breaks down </p>
<p>and weeps.</p>
<p>Mark has sketched vividly contrasting stories to his audience. On the </p>
<p>one hand, Jesus has stood rm when all the slings and arrows of human </p>
<p>cunning have been thrown at him. On the other hand, the key member of </p>
<p>the Twelve has wilted: not under trial but by a simple observation made by </p>
<p>a servant girl and those around her: that Peter had been with Jesus (v. 67). </p>
<p>But wasn’t this precisely what Peter was called to do when he became an </p>
<p>apostle (3:14)?</p>
<p>The Roman Trial (15:1–20)</p>
<p>Two key themes emerge in the Roman trial. e rst is that Jesus is charged </p>
<p>as claiming to be the king of the Jews. e second is the rejection of Jesus </p>
<p>in favor of an insurrectionist by the name of Barabbas. All this strikes a </p>
<p>poignant note: he who has been sent as God’s nal envoy, and he who has </p>
<p>oered God’s kingdom to the nation is now rejected in favor of him whose </p>
<p>type would later on lead the nation into a catastrophic confrontation with </p>
<p>Rome in AD 66–70.</p>
<p>e Rejection of Jesus by the Jewish Crowd (15:1–15)</p>
<p>e arrival of dawn oen signies hope, but in this instance it means further </p>
<p>suering for Jesus. Having decided that Jesus is worthy of death, the Jewish </p>
<p>leadership has now the task of formally charging him before the Roman </p>
<p>prefect, since the right to administer the death penalty has been taken away </p>
<p>from them (Josephus Antiquities 18:63–64). e question asked by Pilate (v. </p>
<p>2) implies it is the charge of claiming to be king that the Jewish leadership </p>
<p>brings before him. is charge has teeth because Rome is always on the </p>
<p>lookout for revolutionaries who may lead the people to rise up against her. </p>
<p>Jesus does not deny the charge.</p>
<p>Excursus: Pontius Pilate</p>
<p>Pontius Pilate was prefect</p>
<p>182</p>
<p>of Judea in AD 26–37, and as such he was</p>
<p>directly answerable to the Senate in Rome. His ofﬁcial residence was in </p>
<p>182. Not “procurator”, as in some versions, basing on Tacitus Annals, 15:44. e </p>
<p>inscription discovered at Caesarea testies otherwise. A prefect is commissioned by the </p>
