<p>Discipleship (the Way of the Lord) 233</p>
<p>e second concerns “the way.”</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>e Greek word hodos occurs sixteen</p>
<p>times in Mark’s Gospel. is is impressive but what needs to be discerned </p>
<p>beyond mere statistics is that it appears in important contexts. At the start of </p>
<p>the Gospel, Mark cites a composite text to set the tone: the “way” of the Lord </p>
<p>is being prepared by John the Baptist (1:2–3). e way of the Lord turns out </p>
<p>to be the way of Jesus Christ. When eshed out later, this way leads to the </p>
<p>cross, and beyond it, the resurrection. Furthermore, Jesus is described by </p>
<p>his opponents as “teaching the way of God in accordance with the truth” </p>
<p>(12:14). Jesus is thus identied with the way of the Lord in dierent forms. </p>
<p>But what is more important in this connection is that discipleship may then </p>
<p>be justiably described as “following in the way.” Many passages that con-</p>
<p>tain the phrase “in the way” (the Greek is en tē hodō) bear this out. To cite </p>
<p>a couple of examples: in 8:27 Jesus asks his disciples who they think he is </p>
<p>while “in the way”; and in 9:33–34 the disciples argue about who among </p>
<p>them is the greatest while “in the way.” e juxtaposing of discipleship con-</p>
<p>cerns with the phrase “in the way” serves to show how the latter is a rubric </p>
<p>for what discipleship means. Jesus is in the way of the Lord; to be his disciple </p>
<p>means following in this way.</p>
<p>e book of Acts demonstrates how apt and powerful this language </p>
<p>is for describing discipleship, where the early Christians are frequently de-</p>
<p>scribed as “people of the way” (Acts 9:2; 19:9, 23; 22:4; 24:14, 22). If there </p>
<p>is any historical reliability to Luke’s account, it may be said that they were </p>
<p>so called because they were followers of Jesus’ way, which is also the way of </p>
<p>the Lord.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Followers of Jesus were known in this manner before they were</p>
<p>called “Christians.”</p>
<p>e missionary role of the disciples is the third motif.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> Jesus’ dis-</p>
<p>ciples are called not only to learn from Jesus but also to further his work </p>
<p>(3:13–19). In 6:7–13 we see how this is accomplished. Jesus sends them out </p>
<p>in pairs all over Israel for the purpose of preaching, exorcising and healing. </p>
<p>e eschatological discourse in chapter 13 adds a signicant datum to the </p>
<p>concept of mission. When many people are carried away by apocalyptic fer-</p>
<p>ment and re-establishing group loyalty through sanctions and persecutions, </p>
<p>the disciples are to be on a mission to bear witness to the gospel (13:5–11).</p>
<p>We come nally to the motif of failure and restoration. e way of </p>
<p>Jesus is a paradoxical way, containing many revolutionary values. Hence, </p>
<p>being a disciple of Jesus is not easy, and Mark pulls no punches when it </p>
<p>25. Marcus 1992; Watts 1997.</p>
<p>26. Fitzmyer 1998: 424. Seminal work on this topic is done by Repo 1964.</p>
<p>27. Not much has been done here but note the assessment of Pesch 1980: 1:60: “e </p>
<p>entire book of Mark is a missionary book!”</p>
