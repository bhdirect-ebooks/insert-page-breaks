<p>Christology 227</p>
<p>Jesus is certainly presented as the Messiah, the one who fullls God’s </p>
<p>promises in the OT and brings to climax the story of God and his people </p>
<p>(1:1; 8:29; 9:14).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>However, Mark sometimes goes beyond Jesus’ messianic</p>
<p>identity and puts him on an equal footing with God: not in the use of the </p>
<p>title of Son of God (as this means primarily God’s chosen king, and may </p>
<p>therefore be regarded as challenging the claim of the Roman Emperor)</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>but in stories and allusions to Yahweh’s role in Scripture (2:1–11, 23–28; </p>
<p>6:45–52).</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>In this regard the messianic category, while important, is deemed</p>
<p>insucient. Of course, Jesus is never once addressed as God. e constraint </p>
<p>of Jewish monotheism prevents this. However, Jesus is presented as more </p>
<p>than a man, with concepts and actions that are unique to God.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Here many</p>
scholars see it t to invoke functional categories to speak of Jesus’ divinity (i.e., Jesus is not ontologically divine but functionally so). However, this is
<p>anachronistic and confuses the issue. For Jews, what makes God God is that </p>
<p>he can do certain things that no other being can.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Perhaps all this means</p>
<p>Mark has not yet found the language for the phenomenon he is attesting </p>
<p>to. at said, Mark is not alone in this, as other NT writers evince such an </p>
<p>approach (see especially Paul’s writings).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>In Mark, Jesus’ favorite self-designation is the Son of Man. is is used </p>
<p>for the rst time in the rst controversy story in which Jesus is accused </p>
<p>of blasphemy (2:1–11), and at his trial where he is also charged with blas-</p>
<p>phemy (14:61–64). All this indicates how important this self-designation </p>
<p>is. While it introduces a sense of mystery, as it could mean man in general, </p>
<p>it could also refer to the gure of Dan 7:13.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>In this commentary, we take</p>
<p>3. See especially 1:1; 8:29; 9:41; 11:1–11; 12:1–12. For recent discussions on the </p>
<p>Messiah, see Charlesworth 1992.</p>
<p>4. To be sure, the Son of God title and its associate appellations are signicant, and </p>
<p>rightly scholars have deemed them to be so despite their paucity of occurrences (e.g., </p>
<p>Evans 2001: lxxiii). However, it must be insisted that this family of appellations is used </p>
<p>in what may be called disclosure events (except for 1:1, but there is textual uncertainty </p>
<p>here), and must therefore be understood in relation to such. What these are will be </p>
<p>covered in the later paragraphs. Furthermore, the backdrop against which these appel-</p>
<p>lations are understood must serve as hermeneutical control, and in this light messianic </p>
<p>or imperial-cult categories are key (see Collins 1999: 393–408 and 2000: 85–100). All </p>
<p>this implies that the title of Son of God should not be understood as the key christologi-</p>
<p>cal theme. Instead, it belongs to a constellation of equally important themes, and the </p>
<p>gravitational center may very well be Jesus’ favorite self-designation: the Son of Man.</p>
