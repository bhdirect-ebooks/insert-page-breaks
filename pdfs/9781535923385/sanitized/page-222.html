<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>14:53–72204</p>
<p>With eyewitness testimonies becoming more like an embarrassing </p>
<p>cacophony of contradictions, the high priest (see excursus for discussion on </p>
<p>his identity) has two important cards le to play. e rst is to get the ac-</p>
<p>cused to incriminate himself by making him answer unadvisedly to leading </p>
<p>questions (v. 60). Jesus wisely remains silent. e second card—the nal and </p>
<p>desperate one—has now to be played. e high priest asks whether Jesus is </p>
<p>the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One.</p>
<p>168</p>
<p>e title “the Son of the Blessed</p>
<p>One” is usually regarded as being synonymous with the royal Messiah(2 </p>
<p>Sam7:12, 14; Ps 2:2, 7; 4QFlor3:11–12; 4Q246), even if the early Church </p>
<p>would later treat it as containing a meaning greater than that.We may detect </p>
<p>in the high priest’s question the cunning that is honed by years of serving in </p>
<p>the highest Jewish oce, surviving countless politicking from competitors, </p>
<p>and handling many sensitive diplomatic issues with an imperialistic over-</p>
<p>lord. e question puts Jesus between the rock and a hard place. An answer </p>
<p>in the armative could easily land Jesus in trouble with the Romans, for </p>
<p>he could then be charged with sedition. If it were answered in the negative, </p>
<p>much of what Jesus came to teach and do would be discredited. Imagine </p>
<p>what would happen if an ocial statement was issued that Jesus had denied </p>
<p>all messianic claims? e nation would then regard him as a hot head, who </p>
<p>had acted thoughtlessly and impulsively.</p>
<p>Excursus: Caiaphas the High Priest</p>
<p>Mark does not tell us who the high priest is although we learn from other </p>
<p>sources (cf. Luke 3:2; John 18:13; Josephus Antiquities 18:95) that he </p>
<p>is Caiaphas. He has an extraordinarily long tenure (AD 18–37). Most high </p>
<p>priests in that period had an average tenure of about four years.</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>According</p>
<p>to the Babylonian Talmud, this was because the high priestly ofﬁce could be </p>
<p>bought with money. As a result, the Romans were pleased to replace the in-</p>
<p>cumbent with a new candidate frequently (b. Yoma 8b), as this would gener-</p>
<p>ate income for them. For Caiaphas to have remained for such a long period </p>
<p>he must have had powerful backers or great political acumen himself.</p>

<p>168. Evans 2001: 448–49 rightly argues that the question is not double, but contains </p>
<p>one compound reference.</p>
<p>169. For a descriptive of the high priests, see Vanderkam 2004.</p>
