<p>rm, as only those who endure to the end</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>will be saved. e word “saved”</p>
<p>here probably refers to eschatological salvation.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>e Abomination of Desolation (13:14–20)</p>
<p>Jesus has been focusing on dampening eschatological speculation. Now he </p>
<p>speaks of the sign the disciples need to watch, which is the “abomination of </p>
<p>desolation.” Our thesis needs some defense.</p>
<p>Jesus counsels those in Judea to ee to the mountains when they see </p>
<p>the abomination of desolation, implying the need for urgent response. </p>
<p>Moreover, the editorial remark,</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>“let the reader understand” (v. 14) implies</p>
<p>that the event, although signicant, is not transparent to all. Furthermore, </p>
<p>the fact that urgent action has to be taken when the abomination happens </p>
<p>supports the thesis that it is indeed the sign. If Jesus intends to say there can </p>
<p>be no sign at all for the Temple’s destruction, as it has been argued recently,</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> </p>
<p>all the foregoing data become incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Having established that the abomination of desolation is the sign </p>
<p>the disciples are to watch for, what remains to be done is to identify this </p>
<p>event. Some interesting clues are already given, especially in v. 14. We note </p>
<p>rst that Jesus counsels those in Judea—and not all Israel—to ee to the </p>
<p>mountains. is signals that the catastrophic event is going to happen in </p>
<p>Judea, and will aect mainly Judeans. e topographically limited scope is </p>
<p>to be borne rmly in mind. Secondly, the abomination of desolation is a </p>
<p>phrase taken from Daniel (Dan 11:31; 12:11; cf. 8:13; 9:27), which refers </p>
<p>to the desecration of the Temple by Antiochus Epiphanes IV. He set up a </p>
<p>pagan altar in the Temple to sacrice a sow to Zeus Olympius in 167 BC (1 </p>
<p>Macc 1:54–59; 2 Macc 6:2). With this as a cue, we may regard the phrase as </p>
<p>meaning “the abomination that makes the Temple desolate” (i.e., devoid of </p>
the divine presence). A similar event should be envisaged, unless otherwise
<p>indicated. Hence, Jesus is telling his disciples to look out for a great sacrilege </p>
<p>of the Temple. Just as it was momentous in the Maccabean period, so also </p>
<p>will this event be to the generation of Jesus’ disciples. irdly, Mark’s edito-</p>
<p>rial words also imply that although the event is signicant, it will not be </p>
<p>86. e Greek eis telos can be construed as an idiomatic phrase to mean “complete-</p>
<p>ly” or as referring to something concrete such as the eschaton.</p>
<p>87. Evans 2001: 313.</p>
<p>88. is is surely Mark’s editorial remark, since if they were Jesus’ words we should </p>
<p>expect “Let the hearer understand.”Till now Mark has not addressed any hortatory </p>
<p>word of his own to his audience, although he has explained things once in a while. is </p>
<p>implies that what is given is a very important sign.</p>
