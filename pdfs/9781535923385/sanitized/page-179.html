<p>Mark does this by mentioning all the possible Jewish groupings as being in </p>
<p>conict with Jesus.</p>
<p>e Parable of the Tenants (12:1–12)</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>e people referred to are not specied and are probably the same people </p>
<p>who questioned Jesus about his authority (i.e., the chief priests), the scribes </p>
<p>and the elders. Although Mark uses the plural “parables,” only one is related </p>
<p>(see 4:1–12 for a similar phenomenon). is shows that what Mark narrates </p>
here is just a sample, chosen because it sheds the most light on what is divid-
<p>ing Jesus and the Jewish authorities.</p>
<p>Mark tells us the audience of the parable understand it is spoken </p>
<p>against them (v. 12), even though Jesus does not provide an interpretative </p>
<p>key. e irony here is that the one parable that is understood by the “outsid-</p>
<p>ers” is precisely the one that leads them to plot against Jesus. One reason </p>
<p>why this parable is easily grasped, even by outsiders, must be that Jesus is </p>
<p>using familiar images from the long story of Israel.e vine stands oen for </p>
<p>the nation (Ps 80:8–18; Isa 27:2–6; Jer 2:21; 12:10; Ezek 19:10–14; Hos 10:1). </p>
<p>Coins minted by Jewish leaders would sometimes use this image too.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>parable may also allude to the song of the vineyard in Isaiah 5, where Israel </p>
<p>is described as a failed vine.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>at said, an important dierence must be</p>
<p>borne in mind: Jesus does not state that the vineyard will be abandoned, but </p>
<p>the replacement of the tenants. Although Isaiah 5 may provide the back-</p>
<p>ground, it is not the determinant of the parable’s meaning.</p>
<p>e dierent characters in the parable may now be identied. e </p>
<p>vineyard is Israel, and the owner of the vineyard is therefore God. e ten-</p>
<p>ants will be the leaders of the nation who have the responsibility of tending </p>
<p>the vineyard. e servants who are repeatedly sent represent the prophets. </p>
<p>e way the parable is told dovetails with many stories about them, featur-</p>
<p>ing above all their violent fate,</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>which is indicative of the nation’s obduracy</p>
<p>(Jer 26:20–23; 2 Chron 24:20–22; cf. Matt 23:34, 37 and the rst-century </p>
<p>work, Lives of the Prophets). e Son must be understood as the Messiah, </p>
<p>37. e Gospel of omas also contains a parable about a vineyard, which scholars </p>
<p>associated with the Jesus Seminar regard as being prior to the Markan version (see </p>
<p>Funk and Hoover 1993: 100–101, 510–11). However, many scholars have serious objec-</p>
<p>tions to such a theory: Evans 2001: 217–19; France 2002: 457; Meier 1991: 1:134. </p>
<p>38. Hendin 1987: 94–95. e vine motif can be found on coins minted in the 2nd </p>
<p>and 3rd year of the Jewish Revolt (AD 67–68). is is accompanied by an inscription in </p>
<p>Hebrew which proclaims “the liberation of Zion.”</p>
