<p>NCCS | New Covenant Commentary Series</p>
<p>e New Covenant Commentary Series (NCCS) is designed for ministers and stu-</p>
<p>dents who require a commentary that interacts with the text and context of each New </p>
<p>Testament book and pays specic attention to the impact of the text upon the faith </p>
<p>and praxis of contemporary faith communities.</p>
<p>e NCCS has a number of distinguishing features. First, the contributors come </p>
from a diverse array of backgrounds in regards to their Christian denominations and
<p>countries of origin. Unlike many commentary series that tout themselves as inter-</p>
<p>national the NCCS can truly boast of a genuinely international cast of contributors </p>
<p>with authors drawn from every continent of the world (except Antarctica) includ-</p>
<p>ing countries such as the United States, Puerto Rico, Australia, the United Kingdom, </p>
<p>Kenya, India, Singapore, and Korea. We intend the NCCS to engage in the task of </p>
<p>biblical interpretation and theological reection from the perspective of the global </p>
<p>church. Second, the volumes in this series are not verse-by-verse commentaries, but </p>
<p>they focus on larger units of text in order to explicate and interpret the story in the </p>
<p>text as opposed to some oen atomistic approaches. ird, a further aim of these </p>
<p>volumes is to provide an occasion for authors to reect on how the New Testament </p>
<p>impacts the life, faith, ministry, and witness of the New Covenant Community today. </p>
<p>is occurs periodically under the heading of “Fusing the Horizons and Forming the </p>
<p>Community.” Here authors provide windows into community formation (how the </p>
<p>text shapes the mission and character of the believing community) and ministerial </p>
<p>formation (how the text shapes the ministry of Christian leaders).</p>
<p>It is our hope that these volumes will represent serious engagements with the </p>
<p>New Testament writings, done in the context of faith, in service of the church, and for </p>
<p>the glorication of God.</p>
