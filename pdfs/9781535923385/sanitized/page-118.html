<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>7:24–36100</p>
<p>if this easier reading were correct, it would be dicult to account for the </p>
<p>rise of the harder reading, especially when the harder reading has early and </p>
<p>wide manuscript support). Some scholars think that Markan theological </p>
<p>interest may be at work here, as he wants to show that the communities </p>
<p>in that region are touched by Jesus, because either Mark comes from that </p>
<p>region or is writing for the communities of that region.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>It may be assumed</p>
<p>that it was at Decapolis thata person who is deaf and speech-impaired is </p>
<p>brought to him. Mark’s audience, if alert, would have been familiar with this </p>
<p>topographical reference, as the healed Gerasene demoniac went throughout </p>
<p>the Decapolis, proclaiming the work of Jesus (5:20). e proclamation has </p>
<p>borne fruit.</p>
<p>e actions of Jesus appear mystifying (vv. 32–35).In antiquity, saliva </p>
<p>was oen believed to be a healing agent associated with both magical in-</p>
<p>cantations, and also physicians’ prescriptions (Galen Natural Faculties 3:7; </p>
<p>cf. the rabbinic evidence in t. Sanh. 12:10 and b. B. Bat. 126b). With regard </p>
<p>to the Aramaic word ephphatha, there is no evidence that it was ever used </p>
<p>in magical incantation. e word is recorded here probably as a result of a </p>
<p>vivid remembrance of some eyewitness. Some scholars think the actions </p>
<p>and the word have exorcistic associations.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p>But we cannot be sure about</p>
<p>this. e “deep sigh” should more properly be translated as a “deep groan,”</p>
<p>179</p>
<p> </p>
<p>indicating the diculty of the miracle. Of course, Jesus might have accom-</p>
<p>modated himself to the cultural mores of the people around him, but such </p>
<p>an explanation does not clarify the main message of this story. e vividness </p>
<p>of the account suggests that Mark has something important to say.</p>
<p>Many allusions to the OT may be detected in the exclamation of the </p>
<p>people (v. 37), which also serves to reveal to us the true signicance of the </p>
<p>miracle. e words “he has done everything well” may echo Gen 1:31 (cf. Eccl </p>
<p>3:11). A superlative is used in the response of the people (“overwhelmed”</p>
<p>180</p>
<p> </p>
<p>with amazement), indicating how signicant this miracle is. Furthermore, </p>
<p>the phrase “he even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak” most probably </p>
<p>alludes to the promise of Isa 35:5–6, where the transformation of the people </p>
<p>of God at the restoration of Zion is envisaged. is proposal is supported </p>
<p>by the use of the word mogilalos in v. 32. is extremely rare word occurs </p>
<p>only once in the NT, and also only once in the LXX at precisely the passage </p>
<p>which we believe the episode alludes to: Isa 35:6! Since this OT passage </p>
<p>is also used in Matt 11:4–6 || Luke 7:22–23 as a summary of the gospel </p>
<p>177. eissen 1991: 234–45.</p>
<p>178. E.g., Marcus 2000: 478.</p>
<p>179. e Greek is stenazō.</p>
<p>180. e Greek is hyperperissōs.</p>
