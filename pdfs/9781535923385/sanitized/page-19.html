<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Larger works have detailed discussions on what is usually known as “Intro-</p>
<p>duction.” Consequently, we will provide only a sketch of where this com-</p>
<p>mentary stands in relation to such matters.</p>
<p>Authorship</p>
<p>ere is no explicit mention of who the author is in the text of the Second </p>
<p>Gospel</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>but we believe him to be Mark. e case for this is based mainly on</p>
<p>two considerations: the superscription and the external testimony.</p>
<p>Superscription</p>
<p>In ancient times the author’s name is found usually in the superscrip-</p>
<p>tion—something that precedes the actual work, and may be treated as the </p>
<p>equivalent to the title page in modern books. e text proper seldom identi-</p>
<p>es the author.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> All the available Greek manuscripts of this Gospel featur-</p>
<p>ing a superscription unanimously name Mark as the author.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>e earliest</p>
<p>manuscripts that have this feature come from the fourth century.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Later</p>
<p>manuscripts contain superscriptions in dierent forms, usually expanded </p>
<p>from the simple kata Markon.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> Some scholars use this to infer that all su-</p>
<p>perscriptions are articial, leading to the thesis that this Gospel circulated </p>
<p>anonymously at the rst until a couple of centuries later.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>What remains</p>
<p>signicant, however, is that despite the varied forms, all of them consistently </p>
<p>state that Mark is the author. Such consistency cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>1. “Second” here refers to the canonical order. We use this label in order not to </p>
<p>pre-judge the issue of authorship.</p>
<p>2. Collins 2007: 2–3. She points out that in antiquity the giving and use of titles </p>
<p>belonged more to the reception of a work than its production.</p>
<p>3. It is unfortunate that the earliest manuscript (P</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>, third century) is missing the </p>
<p>superscription, as it is fragmentary.</p>
<p>4. Codex Sinaiticus (א) and Codex Vaticanus (B).</p>
<p>5. Translated into English it means “according to Mark.”</p>
<p>6. Marcus 2000: 17; Pesch 1980: 4.</p>
