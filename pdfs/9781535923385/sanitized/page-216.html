<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>14:32–52198</p>
<p>nothing less than his leading them once more.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p> In other words, the scat-</p>
<p>tering of the ock that comes from Jesus being struck down ends in a re-</p>
<p>gathering. Just as 10:32 speaks of his leading his ock to Jerusalem, so this </p>
<p>prediction answers it by speaking of his leading them back to Galilee, away </p>
<p>from the city of danger.</p>
<p>e prediction draws from Peter the boast that he would be dierent </p>
<p>(v. 29). Hence, Jesus’ revelation to Peter is shocking. It is also prefaced with </p>
<p>the solemn words, “Amen I say to you.” Peter would not simply abandon </p>
<p>Jesus, but he would also disown him verbally: not just once but three times! </p>
<p>Far from being a cut above the rest, he would do what the others would </p>
<p>not contemplate doing: to disown Jesus verbally thrice. Cock crowing sig-</p>
<p>nals the approach of dawn, and is oen used symbolically for the coming </p>
<p>of hope.</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>In this instance the point made is dierent. Instead of oering</p>
<p>hope, it seals for Peter what he dreads most: his abject failure. To add to his </p>
<p>culpability, Jesus informs him all this will happen before the cock crows </p>
<p>twice (i.e., Peter will not take heed even aer hearing the rst cock-crow). </p>
<p>All this leaves Peter no ground whatsoever to excuse his falling away.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Peter rearms his loyalty and speaks of unswerv-</p>
<p>ing attachment even to the point of death (v. 31). So do the other disciples. </p>
<p>Vows made with ease are oen recanted in the face of terror.</p>
<p>Gethsemane and the Arrest of Jesus (14:32–52)</p>
<p>e route Jesus takes from Jerusalem to his intended destination winds </p>
<p>through an orchard (cf. John 18:1), by the name of Gethsemane. It is here </p>
<p>that the company stops and Jesus prays in great ordeal. It is also here that the </p>
<p>disciples fail miserably to stay loyal to their Master. Succumbing to the natu-</p>
<p>ral inclination to preserve the self, the disciples ee when Jesus is arrested.</p>
<p>e Ordeal (14:32–42)</p>
<p>e name of the orchard is most probably derived from the Aramaic gat </p>
<p>šĕmānê, which means “olive press” and is therefore eminently suitable for </p>
<p>the place of Jesus’ great ordeal.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>According to tradition, it is located on</p>
<p>the western slope of the Mount of Olives, just across the Kidron valley. e </p>
<p>147. is is the signicance of the Greek proagō, which is better translated as “lead-</p>
<p>ing before,” and is oen used to speak of leadership, especially in a military context (2 </p>
<p>Macc 10:1; ucydides Peloponnesian War 7:6).</p>
