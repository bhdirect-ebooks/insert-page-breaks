<p>e Beginning of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>1:114</p>
<p>We now take a closer look at the meaning of Mark’s euangelion. at </p>
<p>the word means good news is accepted by all scholars. But the framework </p>
<p>within which we are to understand it has been disputed. Taking all the </p>
<p>scholarly discussions into consideration but without going into detail, it </p>
<p>seems best to understand this term against the OT and Jewish background,</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p>without negating the possibility that Mark would have been familiar with </p>
<p>the Roman propaganda that uses the term. In other words, Rome may be </p>
<p>the dialogue partner, but she does not dene the meaning for Mark. at </p>
<p>meaning comes from the OT, which the verses that follow make clear.</p>
<p>Of importance are the Hebrew words bāśar (verb) and mĕbāśśer (par-</p>
<p>ticiple). ese words are found in passages with potent theological nuances, </p>
<p>such as Isa 40:9; 52:7 and 61:1. ese passages speak of the announcement </p>
<p>of the good news of God’s return to Zion, ending Israel’s exile and rooting </p>
<p>out evil from the world. Mark’s use of euangelion may then be regarded as </p>
<p>pointing to the fulllment of these promises.</p>
<p>Two more words need to be explicated in the heading: “Christ” and </p>
<p>“Son of God”. With regard to “Christ”, it is best to treat it as a title: Messiah. </p>
<p>“Christ” is the anglicized version of the Greek Christos, which is in turn a </p>
<p>translation of the Hebrew māšîah (anglicized into “Messiah”), which basi-</p>
<p>cally means “the anointed one.” In Jewish thought of the Second Temple pe-</p>
<p>riod, the reference is oen—though not always—to a royal gure from the </p>
<p>line of David, who is expected to come to deliver Israel from her enemies </p>
<p>(cf. 4QFlor 1:10–13, 18–19; Pss Sol 17:21–32).</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>What is more important,</p>
<p>however, is Mark’s use of the term, which means a rm decision can only be </p>
<p>made when the whole work has been analyzed.</p>
<p>e connection between the term “Son of God” and Roman propa-</p>
<p>ganda has been explained earlier but we note here two further things. First, </p>
<p>it is not clear whether this phrase was part of Mark’s original text. Much </p>
<p>has been discussed and there is no consensus.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Assuming it is original, it</p>
<p>will be instructive to explore its Jewish background. In its Jewish context, </p>
<p>the “Son of God” is oen used in relation to the concept of election, prin-</p>
<p>cipally the choice of Israel as God’s special people, and the choice of the </p>
Davidic king as God’s vicegerent. is ts into the ancient concept of divine
<p>adoption, where someone or a nation is singled out as a god’s special love. </p>
<p>For many Jews of Jesus’ day, the term when used on human beings did not </p>

<p>Guelich 1989: 13–14.</p>
<p>9. For a judicious treatment see Horbury 1998; and Horbury 2003. See also the </p>
<p>essays in Charlesworth 1992; and the succinct treatment in Wright 1992: 307–20.</p>
