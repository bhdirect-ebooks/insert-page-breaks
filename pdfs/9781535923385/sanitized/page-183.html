<p>Jesus asks for a denarius to be brought, which is the coin used to pay </p>
<p>the poll tax. He also asks about the image imprinted on it. A typical coin </p>
<p>would havethe image of Tiberius, and the words “TI CAESAR DIVI AVG </p>
<p>F AVGVSTVS.”</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>On the reverse side there would be images connected with</p>
<p>the Roman Empire, usually the goddess Pax.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p> Jesus’ interlocutors acknowl-</p>
<p>edge that the inscription and the image are all about Caesar. He now gives </p>
<p>his pronouncement, which steers him away from the dicult dilemma the </p>
<p>question was meant to create. “Pay back to Caesar what is Caesar’s. And to </p>
<p>God what is God’s!” e Greek word apodidōmi, which is usually translated </p>
<p>as “pay back,” can suggest either pay the tax or reject Caesar by giving back </p>
<p>to him what is his.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>Hence, Jesus’ answer does not give his opponents any</p>
<p>cause to prosecute or denounce him, and yet at the same time it points in </p>
<p>the direction of a full resolution. e emphasis is on loyalty to God,</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>paying to God what is God’s in the Jewish worldview means everything. Of </p>
<p>course, dierent groups would interpret in dierent ways how this loyalty </p>
<p>is shown (thus the adroitness in Jesus’ answer). However, the main point </p>
<p>stands, and Jesus is not simply trying to be evasive. What matters is loyalty </p>
<p>to God. Seen in this way, it is no wonder Mark tells us the interlocutors </p>
<p>marvel at his answer (v. 17).</p>

<p>Marriage and the Resurrection (12:18–27)</p>
<p>In this story, those questioning Jesus are the Sadducees.Recent scholarship </p>
<p>proposes that the term “Sadducees” is derived from the Hebrew ādôq (i.e., </p>
<p>Zadok, the high priest appointed by David to oversee cultic activities; cf. </p>
<p>2 Sam 8:17), and refers not so much to a party that is tightly-knit as to </p>
<p>some aristocratic and priestly families, loosely connected.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>at said, the</p>
<p>early sources (Josephus Antiquities 18:16; 20:199; War 2:165; cf. Acts 4:2; </p>
<p>23:6–8) imply that there must be sucient distinctiveness in their beliefs </p>
<p>and agenda for them to be spoken of as a group. One of these beliefs is men-</p>
<p>tioned in the present story: they do not believe in the resurrection (v. 18).</p>
