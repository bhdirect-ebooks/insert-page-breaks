<p>Miracles Around the Lake 87</p>
<p>in v. 45 Mark informs us the disciples are ordered to get to Bethsaida, aer </p>
<p>the 5,000 have been fed. ey end up instead in Gennesaret, which is on the </p>
<p>western shore (v. 53). A possible solution is to think of two Bethsaidas (i.e., </p>
<p>Bethsaida Julius and the hypothetical “Bethsaida in Galilee”), but unfortu-</p>
<p>nately there is no material evidence to support this.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>Of course, if Mark’s</p>
<p>account is read on its own there will be no diculty. We are not informed </p>
<p>about where the journey started from; only that it ended up in Gennesaret, </p>
<p>because their intention to go to Bethsaida was foiled by the high winds.</p>
<p>Focusing on the Markan story then, we notice rst of all the puzzling </p>
<p>actions of Jesus at the beginning of the episode (vv. 45–46). e disciples are </p>
<p>bundled</p>
<p>155</p>
<p> into a boat and ordered to cross the lake by themselves to Beth-</p>
<p>saida, while Jesus remains on land, to pray on a mountain. Mark later tells us </p>
<p>expressly that Jesus is aware the disciples are struggling against a headwind </p>
<p>all through the night, and yet nothing is done until the fourth watch (i.e., the </p>
<p>hours just before dawn [6:47–48]). is implies Jesus is intentionally leaving </p>
<p>his disciples to struggle for quite a while, which is rather peculiar.</p>
e Romans divided the night—from dusk to dawn—into four watch-
<p>es (cf. Diodorus Siculus 19:26:1; Josephus Antiquities 18:356). e fourth </p>
<p>watch (v. 48) would then be the hours just before dawn. Such a time note </p>
<p>may carry a deeper signicance, as in the OT and Jewish tradition dawn </p>
<p>is the time connected with the coming of God’s help (see especially Exod </p>
<p>14:24 and Ps 46:5; cf. Joseph and Aseneth 14:1–2).</p>
<p>In the history of interpretation, some rather curious explanations have </p>
<p>been given to this episode which avoid reading supernatural elements in the </p>
<p>narrative. Some suggest that Jesus was either wading through the surf near </p>
<p>the hidden shore or walking on a sandbank. e disciples in their terror </p>
<p>thought that he was walking on water.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p>Such a misunderstanding gave rise</p>
<p>to the circulation of a miraculous account of Jesus’ walking on water, which </p>
<p>later reached Mark, the fallacy of which modern scholarship has managed </p>
<p>to spot. All this ignores one thing: some of Jesus’ disciples were experienced </p>
<p>shermen; they should be given credit for knowing whether or not they </p>
<p>were just inches above the lakebed or a few yards from the shore. Indeed, no </p>
<p>amount of naturalistic explanation or exegetical procedures can change the </p>
<p>fact that Mark intends his audience to understand that a miracle is taking </p>
<p>place.</p>
<p>154. It may possibly be identied as el-Araj, on the North-eastern shore of the lake, </p>
<p>but convincing evidence for this is yet to be found. See Strange 1992: 1:692–93.</p>
<p>155. e Greek anankazō is strong, meaning “compel.”</p>
<p>156. Taylor 1952: 327; cf. also Derrett 1981: 330–48.</p>
