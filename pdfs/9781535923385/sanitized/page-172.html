<p>Roman imperialism.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is a place around which much of the</p>
<p>economy of Judea revolves, especially that of Jerusalem. Gis ow into the </p>
<p>Temple, and so do deposits, because it is believed this sacred place has been </p>
<p>guaranteed by God to be the most secure on earth.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>More than this, the</p>
<p>Temple is linked to eschatological thought.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Many Jews believe that in the</p>
<p>last days a new Temple, or at least the renewing of the present Temple, will </p>
<p>come about. God’s presence will then be experienced in an unprecedented </p>
<p>way. is means nothing less than the vindication of Israel, and also her </p>
<p>complete restoration to God, resulting in her glorication. Of course, such </p>
<p>ideas entail the further notion of political freedom. In this regard, a dem-</p>
<p>onstration in the Temple is not like an innocuous holding up of a placard. It </p>
<p>is either a rejection of the Temple’s signicance or a direct challenge to the </p>
<p>Temple authorities: not just on how the Temple is to be managed, but also </p>
<p>on the kind of ideology and praxis connected with it.</p>
<p>Verse 15 tells us the target of Jesus’ action is those who are buying </p>
<p>and selling. Within this group, those who change money and sell doves are </p>
<p>singled out: their tables and benches are overturned. All these data may </p>
<p>easily suggest to a modern reader that Jesus is against the commercializa-</p>
<p>tion of a sacred place. But there is a deeper meaning when the background </p>
<p>is taken into consideration, and the scriptural quotation of Jesus is scruti-</p>
<p>nized. Buying and selling are necessary in the Temple, because the oerings </p>
<p>to be presented to God must receive priestly approval. Hence, it is unreal-</p>
<p>istic to expect the Israelites to bring their own animals, because they do not </p>
<p>know whether the animals will meet with priestly approval. It makes sense </p>
<p>therefore to provide such animals for the convenience of the worshippers. </p>
<p>ere is evidence that before AD 30, such services were found outside the </p>
<p>Temple, but in its vicinity (Mount of Olives), and Caiaphas the high priest </p>
<p>subsequently moved these services to the outer courts of the Temple.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>It is</p>
<p>hard to envisage that Jesus would be against such services.</p>
<p>Why are the money-changers and dove-sellers singled out in Mark’s </p>
<p>narrative? An annual tax on all males is collected for the running of the </p>
<p>Temple, especially to fund the daily sacrices (Exod 30:11–16), which are </p>
<p>regarded as making atonement for the sins of Israel (t. Seq. 1.6). In the past, </p>
<p>the nancial cost of such an institution was defrayed by the kings, but aer </p>
<p>Israel lost its monarchy, the funds came from the common people.</p>
