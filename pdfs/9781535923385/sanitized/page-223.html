<p>e Hearing by the Sanhedrin 205</p>
<p>Locked between these two horns of the dilemma, what would Jesus do? </p>
<p>ings have come to a head, and any attempt at being reticent at this point </p>
<p>would only lead to greater misunderstanding. But a simple answer of “is </p>
<p>is correct” plays too much into the hands of the priest. So Jesus answers “I </p>
<p>am,” but together with a qualication of what being Messiah means. Just as </p>
<p>Jesus has responded to Peter’s confession by couching his messianic claim </p>
<p>in terms of the Son of Man designation (8.29–31), so also does he qualify </p>
<p>his armation here with the Son of Man’s role. In other words, the Messiah </p>
<p>or the Son of the Blessed One is also the Son of Man who sits at the right </p>
<p>hand of the Almighty and comes in the clouds of heaven.Properly speak-</p>
<p>ing, the reply of Jesus in Greek spoke of “the right hand of the Power” (the </p>
<p>Greek used is dynamis). “Power” is a well-known circumlocution for God </p>
<p>(cf. Mekilta of Rabbi Simon14:21; Sifre on Numbers 15.31). Here two OT </p>
<p>passages are being combined: Psalm 110 and Daniel 7. e eect is that not </p>
<p>only does this speak of vindication, but also the Son of Man’s sharing sover-</p>
<p>eign authority with the Almighty. e claim is made more potent by Jesus’ </p>
<p>stating that those who are now charging him will see this event. Jesus does </p>
<p>not specify when this is to happen, except that it is to happen in the lifetime </p>
<p>of these people. Many scholars suggest it refers either to (i) the world-wide </p>
<p>spread of the Jesus movement,</p>
<p>171</p>
<p>the originator whom they are now trying,</p>
<p>(ii) the destruction of the Temple,</p>
<p>172</p>
<p>or (iii) the Parousia, during which they</p>
<p>would be judged by the one who is now judged by them.</p>
<p>173</p>
<p>Upon hearing this claim, the high priest tears his clothes (v. 63).Tear-</p>
<p>ing clothes is an expression of grief in oriental culture (Gen 37:34; Josh 7:6; 2 </p>
<p>Sam1:11). at said, according to the Mishnah, when it becomes clear that </p>
<p>a blasphemy has been committed, the judges are “to stand up on their feet </p>
<p>and rend their garments, and they may not mend them again.” (m. Sanh. </p>
<p>7:5).e charge of blasphemy is entirely tenable, as it may be understood </p>
<p>either in the strict sense of speaking against the Almighty (Lev 24:15–16; 1 </p>
<p>Kings21:13), or loosely for lesser oences such as threatening his represen-</p>
<p>tative (1QpHab10:12–13; CD 12:8) or the high priest (cf. Exod22:28).</p>
<p>174</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course, non-verbal actions can also fall into this category. Such actions </p>
<p>make a person liable for capital punishment.</p>
