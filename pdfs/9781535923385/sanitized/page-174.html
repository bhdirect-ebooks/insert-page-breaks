<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>11:1–26156</p>
<p>nouncement that relaxed certain requirements, and this caused the prices </p>
<p>to plunge. is incident demonstrates that the supply of such a “service” </p>
<p>was not always oered with the convenience of the worshippers in mind; </p>
<p>proteering sometimes lurked.</p>
<p>What we are proposing, then, is that Jesus is demonstrating against the </p>
<p>corrupt practices of the Temple authorities which have turned the Temple </p>
<p>into a den of robbers. is crime is heightened because the hour of fulll-</p>
<p>ment has come, as demonstrated by Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem. e failure </p>
<p>of the current Temple establishment is a failure at the most crucial hour. </p>
<p>is explains why Jesus tells a parable with these authorities as his target </p>
<p>(12:1–12), and predicts the destruction of the Temple (13:1–2).</p>
<p>It must be emphasized that Jesus’ action does not signify cleansing. If </p>
<p>it did, why would Jesus proceed to predict its destruction, if it is ex hypothesi </p>
<p>cleansed by him? Would this not mean the cleansing action had failed? So </p>
<p>proponents of this theory cannot speak of the cleansing of the Temple, but </p>
<p>of an attempted but failed cleansing.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> Again, it is improbable Jesus’ ratio-</p>
<p>nale is that such activities are conducted at a wrong place, namely the court </p>
<p>of the Gentiles.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>is court is not known as such in the rst place. What</p>
<p>we have is a boundary beyond which Gentiles cannot go (Josephus Apion </p>
<p>2:104). In other words, it is not their court although they are permitted to be </p>
<p>there. If Jesus is really interested in clearing space for the Gentiles, the worst </p>
<p>place to do it is where the merchants are, for this suggests the Gentiles are </p>
<p>but second class worshippers, standing on that court while all of Israel may </p>
<p>move close to the altar!</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>at said, Jesus does have in mind the Gentiles, not by clearing space </p>
<p>for them but by demonstrating that the Temple should be ready to receive </p>
<p>Gentiles at the fulllment of the restoration of Jerusalem, signied by his </p>
<p>entry. So Jesus quotes from Isa 56:7, a highly relevant verse. In its original </p>
<p>context the prophecy speaks of the blessings to foreigners arising from the </p>
<p>restoration of Israel. is also includes those who are excluded from wor-</p>
<p>ship in the Temple because of their failing to meet ritual requirements, such </p>
<p>as the eunuchs. So the oracle speaks of an unprecedented gathering of those </p>
<p>who were previously excluded. In this regard, the prophecy relates to the </p>
<p>eschaton where the Temple will no longer be a boundary marker for the </p>
<p>Jews, but embrace Gentiles from all walks of life in the worship of God.</p>
