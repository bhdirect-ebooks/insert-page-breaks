<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>7:24–3696</p>
<p>However, this does not mean Mark is merely repeating himself. e </p>
<p>key dierence is the ethnic explicitness. Mark did not tell his audience that </p>
<p>the demoniac of Gerasenes was Gentile. ey were le to infer this from the </p>
<p>indicators Mark strategically placed. But in 7:24–30, Mark states explicitly </p>
<p>that the woman who comes to Jesus is Gentile. More importantly, Mark uses </p>
<p>this story to set the theological parameters for understanding what it means </p>
<p>for Jesus to go to Gentile territories. e “going to” is not to be equated as </p>
<p>a “going over to,” that is, the Jews are not neglected in favor of the Gentiles. </p>
<p>e primary emphasis remains the house of Israel. Such priority must be </p>
<p>respected, as it stems from God’s promise to the patriarchs: to the Jews rst </p>
<p>and also to the Gentiles would be one Pauline formula that sums this up </p>
<p>well (Rom 1:16).</p>
<p>e Syro-Phoenician Woman (7:24–30)</p>
<p>Mark makes it clear that it is Jesus’ intention to go to the vicinity of Tyre, </p>
<p>a Gentile area (v. 24). In ancient times Tyre was an important trading city </p>
<p>(cf. Isa 14) and it developed close economic ties with the kingdom of Herod </p>
<p>the Great.</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>Its coins were the only ones that the Temple authorities would</p>
<p>accept for the Temple tax, because the quality of their silver was highly </p>
<p>trusted.</p>
<p>170</p>
<p>Interestingly, Josephus describes the Tyrians as “notoriously</p>
<p>our bitterest enemies” (Apion 1:70; cf. Antiquities 14:313–321; War 2:478). </p>
<p>Politics, economics and popular sentiment did not always coincide. Indeed, </p>
<p>there is also evidence that the economic ties Tyre had with Galilee resulted </p>
<p>in benet only to the Tyrians, and many Galileans resented this as a result.</p>
<p>171</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is implies Jesus’ visit to that vicinity might have been oensive to his own </p>
<p>people, indicating yet again that the visit was deliberate. e same pattern </p>
<p>found in earlier passages (e.g., 1:35; 3:13; 6:31–32) is seen here in Gentile </p>
<p>territory: Jesus intends to get away from public attention but does not suc-</p>
<p>ceed. is also indicates that his fame has spread far and wide, and beyond </p>
<p>Jewish Palestine.</p>
<p>e imploring woman is described as being of Syro-Phoenician origin </p>
<p>(the modier “Syrian” is needed in order to make the designation precise, as </p>
<p>there were also Phoenicians in North Africa) and also a Greek (vv. 25–26). </p>
<p>Although the word “Greek” (Hellēnis) as used in biblical literature usually </p>
<p>refers to people who could speak Greek, and not strictly ethnic Greeks, it </p>
<p>is also oen a synonymous term for ethnē or Gentiles (cf. Rom 1:16; 1 Cor </p>
