<p>e Gospel in Action and Typical Activities of Jesus’ Ministry 25</p>
<p>e Sea of Galilee provides the setting of the call story. Strabo (Ge-</p>
<p>ography 16:2) and Pliny the Elder (Natural History 5:15)—both naturalists </p>
<p>of the rst centuries that straddle the Common Era—and Josephus (War </p>
<p>3:506–508) testify to its being full of sh. Many settlements arose close to its </p>
<p>shores and gave the whole region a rather cosmopolitan character.</p>
<p>When understood against the rst century Jewish background, Jesus’ </p>
<p>call of disciples becomes striking. As Martin Hengel has noted, the call of Je-</p>
<p>sus to follow aer him goes beyond the practice of Jewish teachers or rabbis. </p>
<p>ere are no stories of a Jewish teacher calling disciples to follow him. On </p>
<p>the contrary, people chose to follow famous teachers on their own accord </p>
<p>(cf. b. ‘Erub. 30a; b. Ketub. 66b). Hengel therefore proposes that Jesus’ call </p>
<p>resembles that of a charismatic or revolutionary leader, summoning people </p>
<p>to a revolutionary war.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> However, this notion has to be read into the narra-</p>
<p>tive, as there is no explicit mention of it. Indeed, what dierentiates Jesus’ </p>
<p>call from that issued by Jewish revolutionaries is that he included a promise </p>
<p>of transformation (v. 17). With reference to the call story of Elisha (1 Kings </p>
<p>19:19–21), it may be argued that the persona adopted by Jesus is that of a </p>
<p>prophet and not a teacher.But Mark will soon describe Jesus as a teacher </p>
<p>(1:21)! What is more important is to observe that Mark portrays Jesus’ call </p>
<p>as absolutely authoritative, as those summoned dropped their vocational </p>
<p>tasks “immediately.” Hence, we may conclude that while parallel call-stories </p>
<p>oer insights into the meaning of the present story, it should not be used to </p>
<p>limitthe possibilities.</p>
<p>What does being made shers of men mean (v. 17)? Jesus is possibly </p>
<p>using a memorable word-play. Surprisingly, all the uses of this image in the </p>
OT are ominous, for they speak of divine judgment (Jer 16:16; Ezek 29:4–6;
<p>Amos 4:2; Hab 1:14–17). is does not seem to t with the general dri of </p>
<p>Mark’s presentation of Jesus’ ministry, especially his announcing the good </p>
<p>news of God. Could the gospel message also entail judgment? And would </p>
<p>the disciples help in the realization of that? Whatever the precise meaning, </p>
<p>the summoned disciples would certainly be embarking on a new vocation </p>
<p>that would touch the destiny of human beings.</p>
<p>We oer, nally, some interesting observations about the rst dis-</p>
<p>ciples. e rst named, Simon, will be given the nickname Peter later (3:16), </p>
<p>indicating the key role he will play. His name is always mentioned rst in </p>
<p>groupings (3:16; 5:37; 9:2; 13:3; 14:33). Accordingly, he oen functions as </p>
<p>the spokesman for the disciples.We may also expect him to be the older </p>
<p>brother of Andrew, since he is named rst in that pair (v. 16). Simon, James, </p>
<p>7. Hengel 1981: 18, 21, 52.</p>
