<p>More Revolutionary Values for Disciples 137</p>
<p>English versions,</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>does not quite capture the meaning of ei mē heis ho theos,</p>
<p>which actually means, “except God is one.” is strange phraseology is here </p>
<p>because of the Shema. e point may be paraphrased thus: “No one is good </p>
<p>except God, who is one; and this is what the Shema means.” e upshot of </p>
<p>this is that the teaching Jesus is about to give has its basis in the Shema and </p>
<p>the Ten Commandments (which he would refer to again in 12:29–31). is </p>
<p>heightens the status of the discussion, and suggests the following: if only </p>
<p>God is good as the Shema requires, by calling Jesus good is the young man </p>
<p>putting him on that level? Secondly, the commandments that are cited in v. </p>
<p>19 climax with the command to follow Jesus (v. 21). is suggests that Jesus </p>
<p>puts himself on a high pedestal, as the one who sums up Torah. irdly, we </p>
<p>may observe that the commandments cited may all be related to loving the </p>
<p>neighbor. e requirement to follow Jesus, however, is not related. Is this </p>
<p>requirement then to be understood as belonging to the Godward aspect of </p>
<p>the Ten Commandments? If it is so, the implication is that following Jesus </p>
<p>means loving God, bringing us back to the Shema. Admittedly, the forego-</p>
<p>ing is speculative but what gives us some condence in thinking it possible </p>
<p>is that a similar phenomenon may be found in 2:1–11, where Jesus claims </p>
<p>subtly his identity may be understood via the Shema.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>Moving back to the concrete data, we observe that the commandments </p>
<p>Jesus cites exhibit a peculiar order. He begins with the sixth to the ninth </p>
<p>commandments. He then follows with “do not defraud,” before moving </p>
<p>back to the h commandment. What is interesting is the command of </p>
<p>“do not defraud.” is is not found in the Ten Commandments, unless we </p>
<p>think of it as a loose application of the tenth commandment.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>If it is not,</p>
<p>we may wonder why the tenth commandment is le out, along with those </p>
<p>which relate principally to God (commandments one to four). Before we </p>
<p>oer an explanation for this phenomenon, the young man’s response must </p>
<p>be examined.</p>
<p>e man replies he has kept all those commandments since he was a </p>
<p>boy. And now the climax comes and the penny drops. Jesus speaks about </p>
<p>the one thing the man lacks, recalling the one God in the Shema, and enjoins </p>
<p>him to sell all that he has and give to the poor, which will ensure heaven’s </p>
<p>rewards. And, then, he is to follow Jesus. e Markan text speaks ofJesus’ </p>
<p>looking lovingly at him (v. 21). is is an important datum, as it indicates </p>
<p>that what follows is not given out of malice or to make things unusually </p>
<p>dicult for the young man. Love must be the framework for understanding </p>
<p>44. E.g., the NIV and NASV.</p>
<p>45. Further on this see Tan 2008: 181–206; 2011: 2677–707.</p>
<p>46. Marcus 2009: 721.</p>
