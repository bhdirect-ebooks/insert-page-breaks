<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>11:1–26150</p>
<p>e Entry to Jerusalem (11:1–11)</p>
<p>is story is in two parts: the nding of the animal (vv. 1–6), which is most </p>
<p>probably a donkey,</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>and Jesus’ riding it into Jerusalem (vv. 7–11) amidst</p>
<p>jubilant chants, which are connected to the expectation of an eschatological </p>
<p>Davidic king.</p>
<p>About two miles from Jerusalem, while still at Bethany and Bethphage,</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jesus instructs two of his disciples to look for a colt. e instructions indi-</p>
<p>cate either that some prior arrangements have been made, or that Jesus is </p>
<p>using the custom of impressment by which animals may be requisitioned </p>
<p>for temporary service for a prominent rabbi or someone powerful, such as </p>
<p>the king.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>e term “Lord” (v. 3) is interesting, as nowhere else in Mark is</p>
<p>Jesus given such a title. e term on its own can mean “Master,” and the </p>
<p>possibility that the Master here is the owner of the animal cannot be dis-</p>
<p>counted. Alternatively, the Lord may refer to God here. If this is the case, the </p>
<p>requisitioning is done in the name of God for his Messiah.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>What happens aer this is signicant. Cloaks are thrown on the colt </p>
<p>for a makeshi saddle for Jesus to sit on; cloaks and leafy branches are also </p>
<p>strewn on the road by many people; and an exclamation, utilizing the an-</p>
<p>cient traditions of Israel, is made. What do all these mean? e best place to </p>
<p>start is the intentional action to ride on an animal to enter Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Stories of pilgrims and important visitors making their visits Jerusa-</p>
<p>lem are frequently told. In all these stories it is assumed anyone visiting Je-</p>
<p>rusalem must walk on foot. Even the noble and royal have to comply. ere </p>
<p>is a story of Alexander the Great making his trip to Jerusalem, and this </p>
<p>king of kings has to dismount from his horse and walk the whole way into </p>
<p>the city (Josephus Antiquities 11:325–29). is is enforced because of the </p>
<p>sacredness of the city. e practice is so important that anyone who cannot </p>
<p>walk into Jerusalem because he or she is too sickly is exempted from making </p>
<p>the pilgrimage, even for important festivals like Passover (m. Hag. 1:1). is </p>
<p>reinforces the unspoken rule that a person must not ride into Jerusalem. In </p>
<p>this regard, Jesus’ action of riding into Jerusalem is extremely provocative.</p>
<p>2. Gundry 1993: 626, takes it as a young horse; but cf. France 2002: 431, who thinks </p>
<p>it is a donkey. e latter is supported by the parallel accounts in Matthew and John.</p>
<p>3. Bethphage (meaning “house of gs”) is mentioned with Bethany as though they </p>
<p>form a unit. Presumably, this is because Bethphage was a small hamlet associated with </p>
<p>Bethany. Scholars do not know exactly where Bethphage is, although according to </p>
<p>Christian tradition, it is situated between Jerusalem and Bethany.</p>
