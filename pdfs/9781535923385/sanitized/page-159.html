<p>Fusing the Horizons: Marriage, Social Inequality, and Wealth 141</p>
<p>enriched. He who gives up all to follow God’s call will ﬁnd in inscrutable </p>
<p>ways that what he has given up is, in a profound sense, given back to him.</p>
<p>In Jesus’ eyes, then, the health of a society is measured by how strong </p>
<p>marriages are, how the lowly are welcome, and how wealth is shared. This </p>
<p>calls into question what we ﬁnd so often in our world. But before we wag our </p>
<p>ﬁnger at it, we need to take a good look at what is happening in our churches. </p>
<p>Faithful Christians continue to cringe at the news of embezzlement or sex </p>
<p>scandals of prominent leaders. Moreover, big or wealthy churches are quite </p>
<p>happy to pontiﬁcate where small or poor churches have gone wrong, without </p>
<p>thinking whether perhaps they, for their size and wealth, may have imbibed </p>
<p>the wrong values, or worse, belonged to the wrong kingdom. Furthermore, </p>
<p>the conversion of a prominent person is jubilantly celebrated, and that of an </p>
<p>illiterate unemployed person garners nary a notice. The Church should seek </p>
<p>to live out what Jesus has taught about the explosive issues of family, ac-</p>
<p>ceptance and wealth in whatever society she ﬁnds herself and bear witness </p>
<p>to the liberating and empowering nature of these values. Otherwise, we end </p>
<p>up not as the salt of preservation but the bacteria of putrefaction.</p>
<p>Following the Messiah in Service: Third Passion </p>
<p>Prediction (10:32–45) </p>
<p>e third Passion Prediction (10:32–34) is intended to be connected closely </p>
<p>with the request of James and John (10:35–45). is is suggested by the fact </p>
<p>there is no indication of any change of place or time. e latter story is </p>
<p>simply introduced with the Greek connective kai, which means “and.” In </p>
<p>many ways the arrangement and composition of these two stories follow </p>
<p>the similar narrative pattern of the second Passion Prediction, and share </p>
<p>a similar concern. at said, it must still be emphasized that what is found </p>
<p>here is not mere repetition, but a further development of a couple of central </p>
<p>ideas. First of all, apart from its being the most detailed of the three, there is </p>
<p>a signicant new datum given in the third prediction: the Gentiles would be </p>
<p>the ones to execute Jesus, even though the whole thing is contrived by the </p>
<p>Jewish leaders. Secondly, the destination is explicitly named as Jerusalem, </p>
<p>and it is in that city of peace that Jesus will be executed. irdly, the Son of </p>
<p>Man, and not a child, is now used as the example in the teaching on true </p>
<p>greatness. So this prepares the way for the reason, hitherto unexplained, </p>
