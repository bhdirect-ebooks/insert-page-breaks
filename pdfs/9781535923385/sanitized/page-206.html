<p>e Climax of the Gospel Mark 14:1—15:47188</p>
<p>e audience of Mark has been prepared for this key event in the ear-</p>
<p>lier chapters, especially 11–13 which feature Jesus in conict with the Jewish </p>
<p>leaders and the Temple establishment. Now Mark narrates the plot and the </p>
<p>subsequent actions the Jewish authorities take, and what proactive response </p>
<p>Jesus makes to prepare his disciples for his passion.</p>
<p>All this takes place against the backdrop of the Passover, a festival </p>
<p>which marks Israel’s special elect status because it recalls the founding of </p>
<p>the nation.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>So it is poignant that during this festival an unjust action,</p>
<p>taken for political expediency against someone sent by God, was contrived </p>
<p>and carried out. In the midst of this poignancy, however, the good news </p>
<p>that Mark oers should not be lost sight of. For what Jesus does in the nal </p>
<p>chapters relates in a profound way to the way of the Lord, the good news of </p>
<p>the kingdom, and the fulllment of what the Passover truly stands for.</p>
<p>e Anointing at Bethany (14:1–11)</p>
<p>Complicated as the historical question may be,</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>the story as set in Mark’s</p>
<p>Gospel presents teaching that is clear, cleverly formulated, and easily assim-</p>
<p>ilated. e opening verse of chapter 14 sets the story against the backdrop </p>
<p>of the feasts of the Passover and Unleavened Bread. Originally separate, the </p>
<p>two festivals in the course of time became identied with each other as the </p>
<p>“Feast of the Passover.” Passover recalls the slaying of the rstborns of Egypt, </p>
<p>but the preservation of those of Israel (Exod 12:6–20). is formed the </p>
<p>prelude to the deliverance from enslavement, with the intention of making </p>
<p>Israel the special people of God. So this festival relates profoundly to Israel’s </p>
<p>self-understanding and identity (cf. Num 9:2–14; Deut 16:1). e Feast of </p>
<p>Unleavened Bread lasts for a week (Num 28:15–16) and has its origins in the </p>
<p>great deliverance from Egypt, with the emphasis on being pure before God </p>
<p>(the concept of being unleavened).</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>During this fused festival Jewish pilgrims from all over the world </p>
<p>would return to Palestine to celebrate it in Jerusalem. us the festival is </p>
<p>oen regarded as being congenial for revolutions in the name of freedom </p>
<p>and being God’s special people to occur.</p>

<p>So Roman troops are on the alert</p>

<p>116. Matthew comes closest to Mark’s version, followed by John. Luke seems to </p>
<p>have narrated a dierent story, even though the key elements are identical (Simon as </p>
<p>the host; anointing by a woman, which led to misgivings). e focus here is on under-</p>
<p>standing Mark’s presentation. For a succinct summary of the issues and proposals, see </p>
