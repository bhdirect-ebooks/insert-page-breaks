<p>4:1–3458</p>
<p>that some would remain ignorant, and their sins would therefore not be </p>
<p>forgiven. e fault then lies not with the parable speaker but the hearers, </p>
<p>whose stubborn hearts prevent them from understanding the parables. e </p>
<p>Greek hina is usually telic in force, although at this stage of its development </p>
<p>in the rst century, it could be used to indicate result.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>However, mēpote</p>
<p>proves a challenge and has to be arbitrarily construed as being tentative </p>
<p>or conditional. ere are unambiguous words to serve this function, such </p>
<p>as the Greek ei mē. Hence, while this interpretation makes good theologi-</p>
<p>cal sense, it is weak grammatically. (4) Some scholars prefer to dig back </p>
<p>to the Aramaic substratum, and argue that in the process of translating it </p>
<p>into Greek, a misunderstanding has arisen. ey contend that hina prob-</p>
<p>ably translates the Aramaic dĕ, which although telic in force, can also be </p>
<p>used as a relative pronoun, (such as “who”). Mēpote is then construed as </p>
<p>reecting the Aramaic dîlĕmā’, which may be translated as “unless.”</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>produces the sense: “Everything is in parables to those who are outside who </p>
<p>may look and yet not perceive … unless they repent …” Consequently the </p>
<p>verse describes those who are the “outsiders,” but with a hope held out to </p>
<p>them that if they repent they will no longer be outsiders. However, this ap-</p>
<p>proach does not quite solve the problem, since it is clear that Mark depicts </p>
<p>Jesus as typically explaining parables only to his disciples (see vv. 11, 34). </p>
<p>Privileged information is given only to the insiders, implying that it is Jesus’ </p>
<p>intention not to make the meaning of his parables transparent to all. is is </p>
<p>conrmed in vv. 33–34.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the interpretational problems, it should be pointed </p>
<p>out that, if we bracket o theological concerns, the grammar is actually clear </p>
<p>(especially the pairing of hina with mēpote). It speaks explicitly of inten-</p>
<p>tionality. e fact that Jesus explains parables only to the insiders supports </p>
<p>this further. Moreover, the original context of the Isaianic quotation in v. </p>
<p>12 speaks clearly of intentionality too (see below). Resorting to a putative </p>
<p>Aramaic substratum will not do, as we do not have it and any retroversion is </p>
<p>precarious. All we have is the Greek text of Mark, and the contextual indica-</p>
<p>tors he provides us. e diculty lies not with the grammar but with the </p>
<p>presupposed theology. It is jarring to human ears.</p>
<p>One way to solve the problem is to limit the saying to a small group, </p>
<p>(i.e., the religious leaders who opposed Jesus).</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> But the fact that the insid-</p>
<p>ers are dierentiated from “the largest crowd” (v. 1) suggests that a much </p>
<p>bigger group is envisaged. Indeed in chapter 3, those who were described </p>
