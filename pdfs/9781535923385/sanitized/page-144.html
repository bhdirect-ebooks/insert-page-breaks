<p>Fusing the Horizons: Prayer and the Disciples’ Failure126</p>
<p>enough? Would this also suggest there are different levels of prayer and also </p>
<p>different degrees of difﬁculty connected with exorcisms, since the disciples </p>
<p>did manage to perform some earlier? If this were so, it would be natural for </p>
<p>a special class of spiritual elites to arise. Such a pernicious phenomenon is </p>
<p>found in many religions, including institutionalized Christianity, but it does </p>
<p>not square with the tenor of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>All this invites us to think of what prayer is in essence. If prayer de-</p>
<p>notes total reliance on the Almighty to perform the deed, the failure of the </p>
<p>disciples may be explained as their relying on something else other than </p>
<p>God. This is also a form of unbelief, a theme which is prominent in the story. </p>
<p>Being able to cast out demons in the past is no guarantee the disciples </p>
<p>can do so in the present. Faith must not be put on past accomplishments, </p>
<p>however glowing that may be, but on the one true object of faith. Thus, exor-</p>
<p>cism comes by prayer (i.e., by trusting in the Almighty and not on anything </p>
<p>else).</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>Interpreted this way, Jesus’ reply need not be construed as trying to</p>
<p>speak of different grades of difﬁculty in performing exorcisms, or different </p>
<p>levels of praying; it simply points his disciples back to certain fundamentals </p>
<p>connected with discipleship which are frequently forgotten. The emphasis </p>
<p>on prayer serves then to inoculate us from a reliance on formulas or past </p>
<p>achievements. Instead, it directs Christians to place their trust wholly in </p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>The Second Passion Prediction and Sundry Discipleship </p>
<p>Lessons (9:30–50)</p>
<p>ere may be a thematic thread linking together the Second Passion Predic-</p>
<p>tion with the following three clusters of teaching, viz. true greatness (vv. </p>
<p>33–37), generosity of attitude (vv. 38–41), and the severity of stumbling </p>
<p>the little ones (vv. 42–50). Discipleship remains the concern here, but the </p>
<p>three clusters center on the concept of greatness, with the attendant need </p>
<p>to deate one’s sense of self-importance. is then dovetails neatly with the </p>
<p>anti-triumphalistic nature of following the Son of Man, rst announced in </p>
<p>the sayings on discipleship aer Peter’s recognition of Jesus as the Messiah. </p>
<p>is has not been forgotten by Mark, and it hardly needs to be said that in </p>
<p>32. Cf. Schweizer 1971: 189–90.</p>
