<p>e Messiah Must Suer: e First Passion Prediction 113</p>
<p>and the triumph of God’s kingship. is is really the image that takes the </p>
<p>spotlight and therefore endures. Perhaps all this explains why there is no </p>
<p>extant Jewish exegesis that describes the Danielic gure as a suering one.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What we have here is therefore a revolutionary idea; or if not, at least a </p>
<p>revolutionary emphasis. As Mark will show later, the shocking idea of the </p>
<p>suering Son of Man is not due to political circumstances, but is traceable </p>
to the inscrutable divine will.
<p>Secondly, this response is actually a piece of teaching. e implication </p>
<p>is that it is not given as a knee-jerk reaction or made o the cu. Being a </p>
<p>piece of teaching means there will be new elements for the disciples to grasp. </p>
<p>All this adds to the signicance of the saying.</p>
<p>irdly, the domain of enemies has enlarged. It does not comprise just </p>
<p>the Pharisees of Galilee or the Herodians in that same region. e focus now </p>
<p>falls on a formidable group: elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law. </p>
<p>ese are leaders in dierent aspects of the life of the Jewish community. </p>
<p>Tradition (elders), cult (priests), and Torah (teachers of the law) will come </p>
<p>together to condemn Jesus.</p>
<p>e fourth is that this constitutes the rst passion prediction of Jesus </p>
<p>in Mark’s Gospel. ere are three such predictions (8:31; 9:31; 10:33–34) </p>
<p>altogether. ese sayings always end with a prediction of resurrection “aer </p>
<p>three days.” In Jewish usage, this is understood to mean “the day aer to-</p>
<p>morrow” (i.e., on the third day [cf. Josephus Antiquities 7:280–81]). To be </p>
<p>noted too is Hosea 6:2, where such a formula is not meant to be chronologi-</p>
<p>cally precise, but signies “a short while.” Verse 31 provides therefore the </p>
<p>rst reference to Jesus’ resurrection in Mark’s Gospel.</p>
<p>e nal thing to note is that Mark informs us such a prediction </p>
<p>is spoken plainly (v. 32). is is an important datum as the Greek word </p>
<p>parrēsia is found only once in Mark. us far, Mark has told his audience </p>
<p>that Jesus’ ministry in its relation to the kingdom is oen in riddles. But </p>
<p>now Jesus speaks plainly. So the word signals how important this piece of </p>
<p>teaching is, and also that it is not esoteric but graspable by the disciples, if </p>
<p>they are willing to accept it.</p>
<p>7. Some scholars argue that in Daniel 7, the Son of Man is identied with the </p>
<p>beleaguered and vindicated people of God, and in this sense, one may speak of a suf-</p>
<p>fering Son of Man (e.g., Hooker, Son of Man, 189–98; Marcus, 613). e fact remains </p>
<p>that speculations on the Son of Man gure in other Second Temple Jewish writings </p>
<p>do not make it explicit or develop the idea. Instead, the gure is always portrayed as </p>
<p>glorious and triumphant, coming to the rescue of beleaguered Israel. Of course, it may </p>
<p>be argued that behind this description lies the notion of identication. But this is a very </p>
<p>imprecise way of stating things and circumvents the clear intent and theme of such </p>
<p>Jewish presentations: the Son of Man comes to deliver in great power and pomp, and </p>
<p>not to be suer. See Collins 1992: 448–66.</p>
