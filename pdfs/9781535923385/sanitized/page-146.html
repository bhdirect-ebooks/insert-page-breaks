<p>or to respectable people. e despised are not received; they are tolerated. </p>
<p>e great are happily received. In this sense, it is the most natural thing to </p>
<p>receive Jesus or the Father. But Jesus teaches that to receive him or the Fa-</p>
<p>ther, a disciple must receive the little child (i.e., the one without status). is </p>
<p>receiving is done in the name of Jesus. In its Semitic context, this phrase is </p>
<p>oen used in connection with agency and allegiance (i.e., acting on behalf, </p>
<p>and for the honor, of the person named).</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>Hence, the phrase signies here</p>
<p>that such an action is performed because the person wants to be Jesus’ au-</p>
<p>thentic disciple. When the child is received in Jesus’ name, it is tantamount </p>
<p>to receiving also Jesus and the Father. Do note that the concept of Jesus’ </p>
<p>being sent by the Father is found only here in Mark’s Gospel, although it is </p>
<p>frequently mentioned in John.</p>
<p>Largeness of Heart and Vision (9:38–41)</p>
<p>e identity of this exorcist is not given, as the whole point of the story is </p>
<p>to show that working for Jesus is not a franchise for a selected few. e dis-</p>
<p>course which follows is peppered with the phrase “in my name.” is pro-</p>
<p>vides the hermeneutical key for understanding the meaning of this passage.</p>
<p>John’s objection is quite understandable. He has abandoned many </p>
<p>things to follow Jesus. He is one of the designated few who has been given </p>
<p>the commission to perform the kingdom’s acts and to proclaim the king-</p>
<p>dom’s presence. e unnamed man is not. In reply to John’s objection Jesus </p>
<p>makes three points (indicated by the three gar-clauses in Greek).</p>
<p>e rst is that anyone performing a miracle in Jesus’ name will not </p>
<p>speak against him because he is using Jesus’ authority. is indicates the </p>
<p>person is open to Jesus’ ministry. So he cannot at the next moment speak </p>
<p>evil of Jesus. e word “next moment” is important, since Judas’ later be-</p>
<p>trayal of Jesus may otherwise invalidate Jesus’ statement.</p>
<p>Secondly, if someone is open to Jesus’ ministry (i.e., not against it), </p>
<p>he may be counted as being for Jesus and his disciples. Of course, one who </p>
<p>is not against something is not, by denition, one who is for that thing. </p>
<p>To understand how the logic of v. 40 works, we need to bear in mind the </p>
<p>controversial nature of Jesus’ ministry and the eschatological urgency con-</p>
<p>nected with it. In other words, there can be no sitting on the fence by way of </p>
<p>response. Jesus’ ministry is such that if one is not for it, opposition will be </p>
<p>shown. What needs to be observed too is that the logic of v. 40 is indicative </p>
<p>of inclusiveness and not exclusiveness.</p>
