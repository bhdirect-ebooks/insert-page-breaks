<p>e Burial of Jesus 219</p>
<p>linked with burial have been carried out, before the stone is rolled to seal </p>
<p>the tomb which is cut out of rock. Witnessing this are two women: Mary </p>
<p>Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses. Mark mentions explicitly that </p>
<p>these women know where Jesus is buried, preparing the audience for the </p>
<p>next important story.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Mark’s Achievement</p>
<p>At the end of the Passion narrative Mark may be seen as having achieved </p>
<p>the following. He has told his audience in some detail how Jesus’ prediction </p>
<p>of his suffering has actually come to pass. There is but one more element </p>
<p>left, and this is the resurrection, which is related in the next story. He </p>
<p>has also shown in lurid detail the kind of treatment the Son of Man was </p>
<p>subjected to. One could not but recoil at all this and wonder whether it had </p>
<p>to be the case. However, such suffering is part and parcel of the message of </p>
<p>the Christian gospel. The gospel is not about an esoteric experience where </p>
<p>adherents may be taken away from their troubles. It is about confronting </p>
<p>problems head-on, without ﬂinching.</p>
<p>The disciple’s failure has now come to a nadir. It seems that what </p>
<p>Jesus has attempted to do by gathering a group of people and teaching them </p>
<p>has come to naught. However, there is a small glimmer of hope. Against </p>
<p>this depressing picture, Mark tells us there were faithful women disciples </p>
<p>who were at the cruciﬁxion and bore witness to all that was done. Indeed, a </p>
<p>member of the Sanhedrin by the name of Joseph of Arimathea came forward </p>
<p>to ask what may be regarded as a request that could jeopardize his political </p>
<p>career. Even if many have seemingly abandoned the call to discipleship, the </p>
<p>Lord has left for himself some who stand ﬁrm.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mark has mentioned frequently in this narrative that </p>
<p>what was happening to Jesus was already anticipated in Scripture, prin-</p>
<p>cipally in Psalm 22. Just as Jesus was the last envoy to sum up all the </p>
<p>prophetic overtures made to Israel, so he also summed up all the sufferings </p>
<p>of the righteous. What Scripture relates, even when it is about the most </p>
<p>unjust suffering, is truly about the Son of Man. In this regard, Mark recounts </p>
<p>a detail that has puzzled so many: the cry of dereliction taken from Ps 22:1. </p>
<p>This is not to be understood merely as a desperate or hopeless cry. Even </p>
<p>if we give the cry its full excruciating weight, the note of hope cannot be </p>
<p>expunged still. This is so because the cry in context testiﬁes that beyond </p>
