<p>Excursus: Was Jesus Incensed or Compassionate?30</p>
<p>old Latin manuscripts. Their decision is based mainly on the consideration </p>
<p>that it is the harder reading and splanchnistheis</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> is therefore to be con-</p>
<p>strued as introduced by later scribes to ameliorate a difﬁcult reading. The </p>
<p>reading adopted by NA28 (splanchnistheis) and followed by the NRSV is not </p>
<p>without its strengths. First of all, an overwhelming majority of manuscripts </p>
<p>support this reading. This weight of external attestation, which is early and </p>
<p>wide, should not be easily dismissed. Secondly, D is a rather eccentric </p>
<p>manuscript.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>When D is the only Greek manuscript that offers support, we</p>
<p>should be wary of the reading. Thirdly, elsewhere in Mark 3:5 and 10:14, </p>
<p>the potentially embarrassing description of Jesus’ anger has not been tam-</p>
<p>pered with in the manuscript tradition. If scribes purportedly introduced </p>
<p>an “easier” reading at 1:41 because of the potentially embarrassing refer-</p>
<p>ence to Jesus’ anger, one would have expected them to do the same in the </p>
<p>later two passages. But this did not happen. Finally, orgistheis could be the </p>
<p>“easier” reading after all, in that it chimes in better with embrimēsamenos</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p>just two verses down. We will adopt the reading splanchnistheis in our </p>
<p>commentary.</p>
<p>e word embrimaomai in v. 43 is oen used to describe the uncontrollable </p>
<p>rage or fury of animals. Why is this word used of Jesus? Was it the failure of </p>
<p>the leper to follow an express order that Jesus in his prescience saw? Was it </p>
<p>the ravages of disease? Was it the temple authorities? Mark does not tell us, </p>
<p>but what may be instructive here is to think of the narrative function of such </p>
<p>a tantalizing description of Jesus’ emotion. Mark is probably foreshadowing </p>
<p>unpleasant conict to come in his narrative. e phrase “testimony to them” </p>
<p>(v. 44) may be discussed in this connection. e word “them” may possibly </p>
<p>bring together Moses and the priest to form one group. More probably, it </p>
<p>refers to the entire group of priests, without implicating Moses.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>What is</p>
<p>more crucial is the determination of the force of the Greek dative autois. Is </p>
<p>it to be construed as a dative of advantage (i.e., “to them”) or disadvantage </p>
<p>(i.e., “against them”)? If it is the former, the testimony is meant to show that </p>
<p>all the regulations of the priests have been complied with (see Lev 13–14).</p>
