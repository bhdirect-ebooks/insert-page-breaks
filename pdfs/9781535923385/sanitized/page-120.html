<p>181</p>
<p>is hypothesis is strengthened when we realize</p>
<p>that if the people are with Jesus in a remote place, it is superuous to men-</p>
tion that some of them have come from far away. e individual arguments
<p>may not be compelling on their own, but together they do form a cogent </p>
<p>case. Indeed, the parallel in Matthew makes this clear, when it provides the </p>
<p>datum that the crowd glories the “God of Israel” (Matt 15:31), a term more </p>
<p>congenial for non-Jews. One other consideration that supports the case is </p>
<p>that Mark loves grouping stories in threes. If this feeding miracle is inter-</p>
<p>preted as having been performed for the Gentiles, what we then have are </p>
<p>three stories of Jesus performing the signs of the kingdom for Gentiles. If </p>
<p>the foregoing is on target, we are then in a position to consider the deeper </p>
<p>signicance of this story.</p>
<p>e word “another” in v. 1 signals that a story similar to what has </p>
<p>been narrated before will be told. True enough, Mark tells us a large crowd </p>
<p>gathers in a remote place (v. 4; see the parallel in 6:34–35), and has fol-</p>
<p>lowed Jesus for three days (v. 2). eir lack of food draws Jesus’ compassion, </p>
<p>prompting a discussion with his disciples (vv. 2–4). Jesus’ concern for the </p>
<p>crowd bewilders the disciples: where could such a large amount of food be </p>
<p>found in the wilderness? Some commentators nd it impossible that the </p>
<p>disciples should make such a response since they have witnessed a feeding </p>
<p>miracle before. ey therefore argue that there was only one story but Mark </p>
<p>has repeated it for a theological purpose.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p>We do not deny that Mark has a</p>
<p>theological purpose in narrating this. Whether Mark composed this story as </p>
<p>a doublet or derived it from tradition is a more complicated question, which </p>
<p>this commentary cannot delve into.</p>
<p>183</p>
<p>We will therefore focus on Mark’s</p>
<p>message. If we are right about the Gentile setting, the point must be that </p>
<p>very similar blessings of the Jews are also given to them.</p>
<p>e signicant dierences are chiey the use of dierent words for </p>
<p>thanksgiving over the bread, and the numbers involved: 4,000 people (gen-</p>
<p>der not specied) instead of 5,000 men; seven loaves instead of ve; seven </p>
<p>basketfuls of leovers instead of twelve (do note that the words used for the </p>
<p>receptacles are dierent). We do not think the dierence in the words used </p>
<p>for thanksgiving is important (eucharisteō in 8:6 versus eulogeō in 6:41). </p>
<p>First of all, they are synonymous. Secondly, eulogeō is also used in 8:7, for </p>
<p>the thanksgiving of the sh. What remains to be discussed is the dierence </p>
<p>in numbers. Are there symbolic meanings to the dierent numbers?</p>
