<p>the heir of the vineyard. Instead of being received he is rejected, because </p>
<p>the tenants are eyeing the vineyard for themselves. is theme parallels that </p>
<p>of the preceding story: the authorities refused to face the “truth” of Jesus’ </p>
<p>question, because they were thinking only of their political position. It also </p>
<p>dovetails with the Passion prediction: the heir of God will be ill-treated and </p>
<p>killed by the Jewish authorities, the tenants of the vineyard.</p>
<p>Excursus: Problems of the Parable</p>
<p>Modern readers usually have two difﬁculties with the parable. The ﬁrst </p>
<p>pertains to the assumption of the vineyard owner (v. 6). As the story turns </p>
<p>out, his assumption proves to be wrong. If this owner stands for God, is </p>
<p>Jesus then teaching that God has miscalculated? Such a conclusion is un-</p>
<p>necessary, as it is based on a misunderstanding of how parables function. </p>
<p>Parables are not direct exposition—otherwise telling them would become </p>
<p>superﬂuous. They are usually narratives, and these have their own local </p>
<p>coloring and plot. The members of the audience are drawn into these narra-</p>
<p>tive worlds to play certain roles or to see certain truths for themselves. The </p>
<p>message is found not in the details but the whole narrative and the critical </p>
<p>points that relate to the occasion for the giving of the parable.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>The second pertains to the assumption of the tenants (v. 7). There </p>
<p>is certainly no Jewish law that says if the heir is killed, the vineyard will </p>
<p>belong to the tenants. This lack of verisimilitude should not cause too much </p>
<p>concern, since Jesus is aiming to show how absurd the assumption is, an </p>
<p>absurdity that is comparable to the rejection of the Son by the Jewish ar-</p>
<p>istocracy. That said, some scholars ameliorate the supposed difﬁculty by </p>
<p>hypothesizing that the tenants may be thinking either that the son’s appear-</p>
<p>ance implies the owner is dead,</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>or that the owner is too old and frail to</p>
<p>take action.</p>
<p>Some other pertinent points ought to be noted. e rst is the assumption </p>
<p>that the climax of Israel’s story has come. is may be detected in the se-</p>
<p>quence of sendings, and the use of the phrase, “last of all” (v. 6). Since this </p>
<p>is a tale about Israel’s history, Jesus is depicting to his audience what obtains </p>
<p>41. Cf. Gerhardsson 1991: 321–35.</p>
<p>42. Jeremias 1954: 75–76.</p>
