<p>On the Road to Jerusalem</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>9:2–13122</p>
<p>time limit given at this juncture of the narrative and not earlier? Jesus has </p>
<p>spoken plainly about the Son of Man’s passion in 8:31–32, and hence other </p>
<p>profound things may be stated plainly.</p>
<p>Mark tells us the disciples wonder what resurrection means (v. 10). </p>
<p>is is peculiar, as Jews should know what resurrection means, unless what </p>
<p>mysties the disciples is not so much the general concept of bodily resurrec-</p>
<p>tion as the resurrection of the Son of Man. Jewish ideas of resurrection do </p>
<p>not include the rising again of the Son of Man of Daniel 7. Furthermore, res-</p>
<p>urrection, as opposed to mere corpse resuscitation, is expected to take place </p>
<p>en masse at the end of time, when God winds up his redemptive program </p>
<p>for the Jewish nation. So referring to the resurrection of just one person </p>
<p>called the Son of Man may have puzzled the disciples.</p>
<p>We can now see how the question of v. 11 follows naturally. Talk of a </p>
<p>resurrection inexorably leads a rst century Jew to think of the eschaton. </p>
<p>Coupled with this, the disciples have also seen Elijah, who is regarded by </p>
<p>many Jews as being the herald of eschatological times. is being the case, </p>
<p>the question about Elijah may be asked, specically the scribal view that </p>
<p>Elijah must rst come (see excursus). e nagging doubt implicit in the </p>
<p>question is that if the scribes are right, and if Elijah is not actively at work in </p>
<p>Jesus’ day, what ground is there for any talk of the arrival of the eschaton or </p>
<p>for believing Jesus is the Messiah or Son of Man?</p>
<p>Jesus’ answer arms the scribal view, and for clarity connects Elijah’s </p>
<p>coming with the restoration (v. 12). e term “restoration” may be under-</p>
<p>stood as speaking of the time when God nally returns to reign in Zion. </p>
<p>Connected with this is the notion that people will be restored to him and be </p>
<p>reconciled with one another, and that all ora and fauna will return to their </p>
<p>ideal state. But the Son of Man is more important than Elijah, just as the </p>
<p>fulller is more important than the forerunner. So Jesus moves on to speak </p>
<p>of the Son of Man, principally about his suering. As the suering of the </p>
<p>Son of Man is absent in Jewish eschatological expectations, Jesus’ question </p>
<p>serves the purpose of goading the disciples to reshape their perspective on </p>
<p>the coming of God’s kingdom.</p>
<p>A major challenge for commentators and biblical scholars is the deci-</p>
<p>phering of what OT texts Jesus is referring to. Did the OT really prophesy </p>
<p>that the Son of Man must suer? Perhaps the way forward is to think of </p>
<p>Jesus as creatively combining the passages of Daniel 7 and Isaiah 53. is </p>
<p>will then give rise to the notion that the one who plays the role in the escha-</p>
<p>tological vindication of God’s people is also the one who suers for them. </p>
<p>ere is a basis to this conjecture. We have argued that Mark 1:15 has Isaiah </p>
<p>52:7 as its background. If this is the case, there is no preventing someone </p>
<p>from combining this with Isaiah 53, a passage that is close to it. is will </p>
