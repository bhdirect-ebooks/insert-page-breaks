<p>e Beginning of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>1:2–1318</p>
<p>e herald of the Isaianic prophecy is identied as John the Baptizer </p>
<p>(v. 4). John’s characteristic practice is introduced together with a brief de-</p>
<p>scription of the way he is dressed (vv. 4–6). e reference to his attire is </p>
<p>meant to evoke memories of the prophets (2 Kings 1:8; Zech 13:4), and </p>
<p>also to conrm that John was indeed a desert dweller, dovetailing with the </p>
<p>prophecy of the voice in the wilderness.</p>
<p>John is called “Baptizer,” implying that this was his characteristic ac-</p>
<p>tivity and for which people remembered him, which Josephus the Jewish </p>
<p>historian conrms (Antiquities 18:117–19). Mark explains the theological </p>
<p>rationale for John’s baptism as being connected with repentance and the </p>
<p>forgiveness of sins. Such forgiveness is ratied through the outward act of </p>
<p>baptism for the repentant. is ts in with the conceptual background of </p>
<p>the fused text used in 1:2–3: a people truly prepared for the advent of God </p>
<p>must have genuinely turned away (i.e., repented) from their disobedience, </p>
<p>and embraced the gracious overtures of God (i.e., forgiveness). Moreover, </p>
<p>against the rst century Jewish background and the evidence provided by </p>
<p>Josephus, John’s baptism may also be understood as a call to join a new com-</p>
<p>munity. His use of the wilderness as the place of ministry could therefore </p>
<p>have arisen from both practical and theological concerns, as the wilderness </p>
<p>was the place that could t crowds and was also evocative of Israel’s exodus </p>
<p>traditions.</p>
<p>Based on the data above, scholars have speculated whether John was </p>
<p>ever connected with the Qumran community, since there is a convergence </p>
<p>of text, location, and practice. However, given the paucity of the evidence </p>
<p>and some crucial dierences in relation to how baptism was administered </p>
<p>(mainly frequency and agency), it is best to leave the question open.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Verses 7–8 summarize John’s message. e forerunner theme is fur-</p>
<p>ther developed, but with the focus now on the coming one. He may also be </p>
<p>known as “the stronger one,” perhaps harking back to the Isaianic idea of </p>
<p>God as “the mighty one” (28:2; 49:26), or possibly his messenger (Isa 11:2). </p>
<p>Whatever the case, this person is so mighty that John is unworthy even to </p>
<p>do one of the lowliest tasks in society: to stoop down and untie the thong </p>
<p>of his sandals.</p>
<p>Signicantly, this person will also baptize, but with the Spirit. e Holy </p>
<p>Spirit is connected with the OT end-time expectation of a great moment of </p>
<p>cleansing, resulting in the renewal of Israel. is promise is oen described </p>
<p>with liquid metaphors (Isa 32:15; 44:3; Ezek 11:19; 36:26–27; cf. Ezek 37:14; </p>
<p>Joel 2:28–29; and 1QS 4:20–22). Such metaphors show spiritual cleansing is </p>
<p>an important concern of God. e upshot of all this is that the Spirit’s work </p>
