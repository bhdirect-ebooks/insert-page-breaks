<p>e Messiah Must Suer: e First Passion Prediction 115</p>
<p>e passage mentions two actions: to deny oneself and take up one’s </p>
<p>cross. e meaning of the rst may be grasped quickly. It is about the giving </p>
<p>up of one’s rights in order to be at the disposal of a higher call. e second </p>
<p>item needs some explanation. e word “cross” occurs for the rst time here </p>
<p>in Mark. As an instrument of execution, it was viewed with horror because </p>
<p>it not only tortured but also shamed. What is worse is that in Jewish theol-</p>
<p>ogy, being crucied also means being cursed (Deut 21:23; cf. Gal 3:13). e </p>
<p>Romans reserved it mainly for violent revolutionaries or slaves. e image </p>
<p>suggested by the phrase “take up the cross” is that of a person carrying the </p>
<p>horizontal beam (the patibulum) to his place of crucixion.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>ere cannot</p>
<p>be a more vivid way of stating the cost of following the Messiah. In the rst-</p>
<p>century context, the implication of this saying is that the followers of the </p>
<p>Messiah are not those who carry swords to depose pretenders to the throne, </p>
<p>but crosses to die with him. No greater statement of self-renunciation and </p>
<p>opposition to violence can be stated.</p>
<p>is proverb-like saying to support the injunction of v. 34 is notable </p>
<p>for its irony (v. 35). Saving life equals losing it and vice versa. But it is true </p>
<p>only if the qualications to the equation are considered: saving one’s life by </p>
<p>denying Jesus or the gospel results in the loss of one’s true life, now and at </p>
<p>the eschaton. Losing one’s life for Jesus and the gospel results in saving one’s </p>
<p>true life, now and at the eschaton. Life, then, is not dened by one’s ability to </p>
<p>hold on to it, but by its relation to Jesus and the gospel.</p>
<p>e word “gospel”—rst introduced in 1:1, and mentioned at the stra-</p>
<p>tegic 1:14–15—has been kept in abeyance until now. It will appear again at </p>
<p>10:29; 13:10; and 14:9 (not counting 16:15). When one takes a closer look at </p>
<p>how it has been used thus far, some insight into what Mark may be trying to </p>
<p>do surfaces. In 1:1 and 1:14–15, the word is used to speak of Jesus’ message. </p>
<p>Especially in 1:14–15, this message is that which signals to the world God’s </p>
<p>fulllment of his promises to redeem his people. is is indeed the good </p>
<p>news that subverts the counterfeit of the Empire’s. But with the use in 8:35, </p>
<p>a dierent key is played. at which marks the fulllment of God’s promises </p>
<p>and ushers in a new age is also that for which one may lose one’s life, because </p>
<p>this generation is sinful and adulterous. In this regard, the gospel is not just </p>
<p>about salvation but also about discipleship. And this latter theme will be the </p>
<p>focus of the use of the word in 10:29 and 14:9.</p>
<p>e verses in vv. 36–37 clarify the meaning of the ironical saying in </p>
<p>v. 35, and serve also to encourage Jesus’ audience to make the right choice. </p>
<p>ey also give hermeneutical balance to the earlier verse. e way of the cross </p>
<p>is not about destroying life—not even one’s own—but it is fundamentally </p>
