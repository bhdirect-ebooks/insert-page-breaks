<p>thing a human being could do, and strongly condemned (Isa 10:2; Mal 3:5). </p>
Mark does not tell us how the scribes divested widows of their property, but
<p>many scholarly guesses have been given: mismanaging an estate of which </p>
<p>they have become trustees;</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>taking their houses as pledges for unpaid</p>
<p>debt;</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>promoting a kind of religion that actually ends up making the poor</p>
<p>even poorer (usually widows);</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>or perhaps exploiting their hospitality and</p>
<p>trust.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>e second scene brings us to the Court of Women</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>in the Temple,</p>
<p>where chests for the collection of the Temple tax and oerings are set up </p>
<p>(m. Šeq. 6:5).e contrast between the oering of the rich and the paltry </p>
<p>sum of the widow provides a teaching point. e Greek word behind the </p>
<p>NIV’s “copper coin” is lepton, worth less than a hundredth of the denarius, </p>
<p>a day’s wage.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>is is the smallest denomination in use. Mark also writes</p>
<p>that the value of the two lepta is equal to a kordrantē, which is the Greek </p>
<p>transliteration for the Latin quadrans, the least of the Roman coins. All this </p>
<p>serves to show how small the amount is. However, thedisciples are made </p>
<p>to understand that despite the paltry amount, the widow has actually out-</p>
<p>given the rich.e rich gave out of their wealth and remained rich; but </p>
<p>the widow gave all that she had to live on (v. 44). According to the scale of </p>
<p>values in the kingdom of God, that woman certainly gave more, as she had </p>
<p>given herself.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>Is this an echo of the discussion in Mark 10:41–45, which</p>
<p>concluded by saying that the Son of Man gave his own life (i.e., gave up </p>
<p>everything), in the name of serving the people of God?</p>
<p>Summary: the Controversies in Jerusalem</p>
<p>Is there a common thread suturing together the dierent conict stories </p>
<p>that are narrated in 11:27—12:44? In deriving this, the signicance of some </p>
<p>key data must be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>72. is is the traditional interpretation which posits that Jesus was praising the </p>
<p>widow. It has become quite popular of late to regard Jesus as lamenting that the oer-</p>
<p>tory led to deprivation of the poorest in the community (Evans 2001: 282–83; Myers </p>
<p>1988: 321). We remain unconvinced by this latest trend, as there appears precious little </p>
<p>in the passage that supports this. See the discussion in Gundry 1993: 730–31.</p>
