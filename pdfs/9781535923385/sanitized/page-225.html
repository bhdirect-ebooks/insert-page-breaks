<p>e Hearing by the Sanhedrin 207</p>
<p>Peter’s Denial (14:66–72)</p>
<p>Mark adroitly shis the scene to Peter, depicting another “trial,” that of Pe-</p>
<p>ter’s loyalty. e Greek word for “servant girl” here (v. 67) is paidiskē, which </p>
<p>is the feminine diminutive of pais. is can mean either the girl is very </p>
<p>young or, more probably, her social status is insignicant (i.e., the lowliest </p>
<p>servant).A person who usually poses no threat by virtue of her social posi-</p>
<p>tion now sends shivers down the spine of this Galilean with just a simple </p>
<p>statement: “You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus” (v. 67). is statement </p>
<p>threatens Peter’s much desired anonymity, and so he denies it. Sensing that </p>
<p>his cover could be blown if this conversation were allowed to be prolonged, </p>
<p>he leaves the reside for the entrance of the courtyard (v. 68). e servant </p>
<p>girl now gets others involved by telling them who she thinks Peter is (v. 69). </p>
<p>Peter issues another denial. Finally, these people become convinced Peter </p>
<p>was with Jesus because his Galilean accent gives him away (v. 70). e only </p>
<p>way for Peter to escape suspicion is to issue an even stronger denial, one </p>
<p>which is backed up by curses and swearing (v. 71).</p>
<p>On whom precisely are the curses called? Mark does not indicate. It </p>
<p>could be Peter or, more plausibly, Jesus. e Greek verb anathematizō is </p>
<p>actually transitive (i.e., it needs a grammatical object to complete its mean-</p>
<p>ing). But it appears to be used reexively in Acts23:12, 14, 21. However, the </p>
<p>reexive force is clear in Acts only because it is accompanied by the Greek </p>
<p>reexive heautous. is is absent in Mark 14:71. If we accept therefore that </p>
<p>there is no grammatical support for understanding Mark’s anathematizō as </p>
<p>having reexively force, the conclusion is that Peter is calling down curses </p>
<p>on someone other than himself. e inescapable entailment of this conclu-</p>
<p>sion will be that the one being cursed is Jesus.</p>
<p>180</p>
<p>is actually serves to give</p>
<p>Peter’s denial greater veracity but poignantly, it also heightens his guilt.</p>
<p>Mark has thus shown us how Peter’s denial became progressively se-</p>
<p>vere, and how he moved further and further away from the ideals of disci-</p>
<p>pleship.However, the story has not ended yet, as Mark moves on to narrate </p>
<p>that just when Peter has nished denying and swearing, a cock crows the </p>
<p>second time (v. 72). Mark does not narrate the rst crowing, and the inten-</p>
<p>tion may be that he is once again heightening Peter’s failure.</p>
<p>181</p>
<p>e point is</p>
<p>that warning has already been served by the rst crowing, but Peter did not </p>
<p>take heed, as he was absorbed in self-preservation. He woke up from this </p>
<p>“spiritual slumber” only with the second crowing. With this, Peter’s guilt </p>
<p>180. Pace Craneld 1959: 447–48; but cf. Evans 2001: 466.</p>
<p>181. Some manuscripts add kai alektōr ephōnēsen (i.e., “and a cock crowed”) to v. 68 </p>
<p>in order to make Jesus’ prediction and its fulllment seamless but it is certainly a scribal </p>
<p>gloss. All this means Mark does not inform us of the rst crowing of the cock.</p>
