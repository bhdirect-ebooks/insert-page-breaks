<p>Excursus: Mark and John on the Hour of Crucixion 213</p>
<p>and the cruciﬁxion can plausibly be ﬁxed at the third hour (i.e., about 9:00 </p>
<p>AM).</p>
<p>e second detail has to do with the titulus (v. 26).In Latin, this is probably </p>
<p>IESUS NAZARENUS REX IUDAEORUM (translated into English it means </p>
<p>“Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews”), which accounts for the use of INRI in </p>
<p>much of Christian art on the crucixion.When a criminal is crucied under </p>
<p>Roman administration, his crime is written down on a placard and oen </p>
<p>hung on the neck of the condemned.</p>
<p>195</p>
<p>Where this is placed in Jesus’ case</p>
<p>Mark does not inform us, although from other Gospels we may gather it is </p>
<p>above his head, on the vertical beam (Matt 27:37; John19:19). e charge </p>
<p>against Jesus could well be written as a title with, of course, a sarcastic tone. </p>
<p>e point is to humiliate Jesus and the Jews. But the Markan audience would </p>
<p>have seen beyond this sarcasm to detect a paradoxical reality here. All along </p>
<p>Jesus has commanded silence about his kingly status, but now it is made </p>
<p>known to all in a paradoxical setting. In other words, it is when he is cruci-</p>
<p>ed that the whole crowd gets to read his kingly claims. It may be a joke to </p>
<p>the Romans, and a sick joke to the Jewish leaders (see John19:19–22), but </p>
<p>Mark’s audience knows it is truer than these people dare to believe. e king </p>
<p>is now nally enthroned, not on a throne of velvet but on a Roman gibbet.</p>
<p>e third detail concerns those who are crucied on both sides of Je-</p>
<p>sus (v. 27).e Greek term used to describe these two criminals is lēstai, and </p>
<p>it refers not so much to robbers as to violent rebels or bandits.</p>
<p>196</p>
<p>ese are</p>
<p>probably patriots who are set on overthrowing Roman rule. eir positions </p>
<p>relative to Jesus are signicant, as the Greek replicates almost verbatim that </p>
<p>used by James and John when they requested to sit on the right and le of </p>
<p>Jesus (10:37). If there is an intended irony here, it is that when the moment </p>
<p>comes to drink the cup of Jesus and be on his right and le, James and John </p>
<p>are nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Verses 29–30 record the fourth detail: the reaction of those who are </p>
<p>witnessing the crucixion. It is one of scorn and mockery. at which is </p>
<p>connected with the Temple is vented: Jesus is challenged to come down </p>
<p>from the cross to save himself if he wants to back his claim to be able to de-</p>
<p>stroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days. In other words, in the minds of </p>
<p>these people a form of poetic justice is now being played out: the would-be </p>
<p>Temple destroyer is himself destroyed, while the Temple stands. e Jewish </p>
