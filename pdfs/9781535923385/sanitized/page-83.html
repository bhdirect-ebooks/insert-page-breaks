<p>Healing the Gerasene Demoniac 65</p>
<p>overtly Gentile territory, developing the idea already suggested in the Par-</p>
<p>able of the Mustard Seed (4:30–32).</p>
<p>Excursus: The Location of the Story</p>
<p>The Greek manuscript tradition is quite confused here, mirroring the an-</p>
<p>cient confusion over where this town is located. Based on the most ancient </p>
<p>manuscript testimony (א and B, fourth century), the reading Gerasenes </p>
<p>should be preferred over against competitors such as Gadarenes (attested </p>
<p>by the majority of manuscripts but they are unfortunately late), Gergesenes </p>
<p>(few and late) or even the strange Gergystenes (unique to W, ﬁfth century). </p>
<p>There is, however, a problem with the earliest reading Gerasenes. If this </p>
<p>is the ancient name of the modern town of Jerash in Jordan, it means </p>
<p>it is located about thirty-seven miles from the banks (SE) of the Sea of </p>
<p>Galilee! It appears incredible that the pigs would have run this distance </p>
<p>before drowning in the lake (v. 13). Furthermore, no steep banks may be </p>
<p>found. Gadarenes fares slightly better, since it is ﬁve miles from the lake in </p>
<p>a south-easterly direction. Moreover, this city has limits reaching all the way </p>
<p>to the shore. This reading seems to prevail in Matt 8:28. However, it suffers </p>
<p>from the same problem as the earlier one, as steep banks cannot be found </p>
<p>on the south-eastern bank of the lake. In terms of topography, Gergesenes </p>
<p>is the best candidate, that is, if we identify it with the modern day Kursi. </p>
<p>This is situated on a plateau, on the east bank of the lake. But the reading </p>
<p>is attested by a few manuscripts only, and they are all late witnesses (eighth </p>
<p>century onwards). One possible way of harmonizing textual testimony with </p>
<p>geographical reality is to regard the name Gerasenes as being derived from </p>
<p>the Hebrew root grš, which means “to banish.” This is a term commonly </p>
<p>used to describe exorcism.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>Accordingly, the event may be regarded as</p>
<p>historical but the name of the place as given symbolically. If this is the case, </p>
<p>we will not be able to locate where the exorcism took place.</p>
<p>In ancient Palestine the deceased were buried in caves, which explains why </p>
<p>tombs could be a dwelling place for social outcasts. What led the demoniac </p>
<p>to meet Jesus, Mark does not say (v. 2). One may surmise it was the mag-</p>
<p>netic authority of Jesus (cf. 1:23–24).</p>
