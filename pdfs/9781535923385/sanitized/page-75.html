<p>e Kingdom in Parables 57</p>
<p>e point is that the key to understanding Jesus’ many parables lies with one </p>
<p>particular parable. Conversely, to ask about the meaning of the Parable of </p>
<p>the Sower is to ask about the parables.</p>
<p>In v. 11 Jesus speaks of the “secret” of the kingdom of God. e Greek </p>
<p>word used here is mystērion, and it occurs only once in Mark’s Gospel. It </p>
<p>refers to God’s secret purpose which is known only through revelation. </p>
<p>Indeed, it harks back to the Aramaic rāz, used in Dan 2:18–19, 27–30, 40, </p>
<p>where Daniel interprets Nebuchadnezzar’s dream of the compositely-made </p>
<p>statute by referring to God’s secret. In this sense, what Jesus is about to teach </p>
<p>his disciples cannot be obtained through human ability, but comes as a gi, </p>
<p>a revelation. is means the images generated by the parables will remain in </p>
<p>the minds of Jesus’ hearers, teasing them into active thought but never pro-</p>
<p>viding them with the requisite meaning until the light from Jesus’ teaching </p>
<p>shines into them. It is also to be noted that with this verse, the connection </p>
<p>between Jesus’ parables and the reign of God coming through his ministry </p>
<p>is made explicit.</p>
<p>Who are those who are described as “on the outside” (v. 11)? In chapter </p>
<p>3, those who were described or implied to be “outside” (3:31) were Jesus’ </p>
<p>family and the scribes respectively. It may then be inferred that the “outsid-</p>
<p>ers” here are those who are quick to dismiss Jesus’ claims and teaching. To </p>
<p>the “outsiders” everything about Jesus’ ministry remains as a parable or a </p>
<p>māšāl (i.e., a dark saying), but the “insiders” are given the secret for decod-</p>
<p>ing it. Two contrasts are thus set up: revelation versus concealment, and </p>
<p>insiders versus outsiders.</p>
<p>Verse 12 presents intractable interpretation problems. ere is debate </p>
<p>on how the Greek hina, and the corresponding mēpote, may be construed. </p>
<p>e question concerns chiey whether the Greek words convey intention </p>
<p>or result. Because of space constraint, only the main lines of interpretation </p>
<p>are discussed here.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>(1) If the Greek hina is telic (i.e., stating purpose),</p>
<p>then Jesus is saying that the parables are told with the express purpose to </p>
<p>make outsiders remain ignorant, so that their sins remain unforgiven. e </p>
<p>counterpart mēpote (lest) conrms the statement’s telic force. e problem </p>
<p>facing this interpretation is that it appears to contradict Jesus’ proclamation </p>
<p>of good news to all and sundry. (2) One variant of this approach is to treat </p>
<p>the Greek hina as being a short hand for hina plērōthē (i.e., in order that it </p>
<p>may be fullled), a formula for citing scripture. is redirects the intention </p>
<p>from Jesus to Scripture. But the troublesome intentionality is still there. (3) </p>
<p>If it is ecbatic in force (i.e., stating result), the statement of Jesus may be </p>
<p>interpreted thus: the result—not the intention—of teaching in parables is </p>
<p>89. For a good discussion, see Evans 1989b: 91–106.</p>
