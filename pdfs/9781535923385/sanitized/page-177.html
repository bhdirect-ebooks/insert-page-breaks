<p>Challenge in Jerusalem: SymbolsofFulllmentandJudgment 159</p>
<p>prayers and forgiveness may come, especially when such faith is exercised in </p>
<p>accordance with the character of the forgiving Father.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>In short, what Jesus utters are not general statements on eective </p>
<p>prayer. Instead they relate particularly to his action in the Temple, and the </p>
<p>self-understanding of his role in regard to the promises made to Zion: he </p>
<p>has been acting out their fulllment.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>e Temple, its function and what it</p>
<p>stands for as a sign of election, has been replaced by faith. In this light we </p>
<p>can see that Jesus’ response to Peter is not a non sequitur, like ships pass-</p>
<p>ing in the night. Jesus answers the disciples question in a profound way. </p>
<p>e faith that can cast the Temple mount into the sea is connected with the </p>
<p>withering of the g tree.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>e Doomed Temple and the Withered Tree</p>
<p>We are now in a position to grasp more fully the meaning of this Markan </p>
<p>sandwich. In the OT the g tree is sometimes used to speak proverbially </p>
<p>of peace and security, linked oen with the eschaton (Mic 4:4; Zech 3:10). </p>
<p>Moreover, its use in the eschatological speculation of Second Temple Ju-</p>
<p>daism suggests it can be construed easily as a symbol for eschatological </p>
<p>conditions.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> In this regard, the cursing of the g tree and the demonstra-</p>
<p>tion in the Temple may be seen as stemming from a unitary message of </p>
<p>Jesus: the eschaton has come, but Israel as represented by her leaders and </p>
<p>key institutions is found wanting. It is also instructive to note that in Jer </p>
<p>8:13, a passage close to Jer 7:11, the prophet speaks of God’s judgment that </p>
<p>results in barren vines and barren g trees, oering us a further clue to the </p>
<p>meaning intended by Mark. e barren g tree presents a symbolic picture </p>
<p>of the Temple: it is equally barren. Instead of being a house of prayer for all </p>
<p>nations, it has become a den of robbers. Jesus’ cursing of the g tree and its </p>
<p>subsequent withering symbolically expounds the fate awaiting this Temple. </p>
<p>It is doomed; the king of Zion has entered the Temple, inspected it and </p>
<p>rejected it. Just as the g tree withers because it is cursed by Jesus, so will the </p>
<p>Temple be removed to the sea (i.e., destroyed). So the story of the cursing of </p>
<p>the g tree is not about ethics but about theology.</p>
<p>32. Evans 2001: 188–89 comes to a similar conclusion. In fact, he argues that the </p>
<p>metaphor of moving mountains is eschatological.</p>
<p>33. A similar conclusion is reached recently by Kirk 2012: 509–27.</p>
<p>34. Verse 26 is not found in early manuscripts and may be regarded as a scribal </p>
<p>addition, made in the interest of clarity.</p>
