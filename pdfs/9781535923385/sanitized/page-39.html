<p>John the Baptist and Jesus’ Ministry 21</p>
<p>rst exodus. Instead of forty years, he is tempted for forty days by Satan. e </p>
<p>mention of Satan also serves to foreshadow the conict to come in Jesus’ </p>
<p>ministry. Interestingly, Jesus is described as being with the wild beasts (v. </p>
<p>13). e signicance of this remark is unclear. It may refer either to the </p>
<p>intensity of his temptation (i.e., threat of wild beasts), or the restoration of </p>
<p>paradisiac conditions (i.e., wild beasts are tamed).</p>
