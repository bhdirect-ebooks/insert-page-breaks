<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>15:21–41216</p>
<p>Upon hearing those words, the crowd thinks mistakenly that Jesus is </p>
<p>calling for Elijah.Popular Jewish piety regards Elijah as not only the agent </p>
<p>to restore all things, but also the person who can deliver Jews out of duress </p>
<p>and calamities. e Babylonian Talmud tells the story of Rabbi Eleazar who </p>
<p>is rescued from a Roman trial by Elijah, who is disguised as a Roman ocial </p>
<p>(b. ‘Avod. Zar. 17b). Such expectation has its roots in the belief that Elijah </p>
<p>was taken up to heaven without dying (cf. 2 Kings2:11), and therefore could </p>
<p>come back to earth to oer help. e oering of vinegarto Jesus is peculiar. </p>
<p>Perhaps it is meant to awaken him so that he too can wait a little longer, in </p>
<p>case Elijah does come.</p>
<p>202</p>
<p>Or possibly, the words of v. 36 may be sarcastic and</p>
<p>derisory.</p>
<p>203</p>
<p>Of course, to Jesus Elijah has already come, and humans have</p>
<p>done to him what they wished. So with another cry, Jesus breathes his last.</p>
<p>Two Responses to Jesus’ Death (15:38–39)</p>
<p>Two signicant things happen at the death of Jesus. e rst is a portent, </p>
<p>located in the Temple. We cannot be certain exactly which curtain Mark </p>
<p>is referring to, although construing it as that which separates the Holy of </p>
<p>Holies from the Holy Place makes good theological sense (i.e., the inner </p>
<p>veil and not the outer curtain).</p>
<p>204</p>
<p>is must have been a dramatic sign, as</p>
<p>this curtain is probably 90 feet in length.</p>
<p>205</p>
<p>Being the curtain for shielding</p>
<p>the Holy of Holies from prying eyes, its rending must have been greatly </p>
<p>signicant to all who witnessed it. However, the exact signicance Mark </p>
<p>hopes to convey with this account is not entirely clear. It may mean there is </p>
<p>now free access to the presence of God, as the writer of Hebrews construes </p>
<p>it (Heb10:19–20; cf.6:19–20),</p>
<p>206</p>
<p>or that the Temple is desecrated, as the</p>
<p>Holy of Holies is now profaned.</p>
<p>207</p>
<p>What should not be missed, however,</p>
is that the tearing of the curtain is intended to be a divine response to the
<p>death of Jesus.</p>
<p>e other signicant happening concerns a Roman centurion.As the </p>
<p>rst human being in Mark’s Gospel to confess Jesus as the authentic Son of </p>
<p>God, there are at least two theological points being made.e rst is that </p>
<p>it is only when Jesus is crucied that human beings may see clearly and </p>

<p>205. is is conjectured from the datum that the height of the hall just before the </p>
<p>Holy of Holies was 60 cubits high (Josephus War 5:215–19). Cf. France 2002: 656.</p>
