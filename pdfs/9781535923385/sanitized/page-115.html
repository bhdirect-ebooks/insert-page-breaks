<p>“All Foods Made Clean” and the Extension of the Ministry to Gentiles 97</p>
<p>1:22–24). Mark could not have chosen a better story to speak of the im-</p>
<p>plication of rendering all foods clean, as what may be regarded as utterly </p>
<p>disadvantageous comes to the fore: it is a woman who implores Jesus; the </p>
<p>request is about driving out an unclean spirit; the one who comes to Jesus </p>
<p>is a Gentile.</p>
<p>e verbal exchange between Jesus and the woman is highly fascinat-</p>
<p>ing (vv. 27–30). In an apparent refusal to answer the woman’s request, Jesus </p>
<p>states the children must be fed rst, as it is not right for their food to be </p>
<p>given to dogs. e use of this image would certainly have caused oense </p>
<p>for rst-century Mediterranean people, just as modern readers may regard </p>
<p>it as harsh. Dogs were regarded by Jews as unclean, and their status in the </p>
<p>eyes of many Gentiles did not fare better, even if they were household dogs. </p>
<p>OT references to dogs are usually pejorative (e.g., 1 Sam 17:43; 2 Sam 16:9; </p>
<p>Ps 22:16; Isa 56:10–11). Indeed, Jews oen call Gentiles dogs (1 En 89:42, </p>
<p>46–47, 49; cf. Pirque R. El. 29). Interestingly, Mark does not clarify what </p>
<p>kind of dogs Jesus is referring to, although the woman thinks of them as do-</p>
<p>mestic ones, waiting anxiously under the table.</p>
<p>172</p>
<p>e question arising from</p>
<p>all this is whether Mark has portrayed Jesus as being callous and oensive.</p>
<p>e word “rst” of v. 27 shows there is more to the plain meaning of </p>
<p>Jesus’ statement. If there is a “rst,” one may logically expect a “second.” is </p>
<p>has implication for our understanding of Jesus’ statement, which we will </p>
<p>elaborate below. Moreover, the woman actually perceives a more power-</p>
<p>ful insight suggested by the image constructed by Jesus. Addressing him </p>
<p>as “Lord,” she reasons that there is no need for the children to be fully fed </p>
<p>rst, as the crumbs that drop from the table may be given to the dogs. Jesus’ </p>
<p>response is that it is precisely such a reply that brings about the exorcism </p>
<p>(v. 29). is is the only instance in Mark’s Gospel that anyone has won (ap-</p>
<p>parently) an argument with Jesus! But what is the underlying message here? </p>
<p>ere are four things that warrant a closer look. e rst concerns Jesus’ </p>
<p>apparently indierent attitude. e second is the word “rst” used by Jesus. </p>
<p>e third has to do with the image Jesus employs. And the fourth is the reply </p>
<p>made, for Mark tells us this is precisely the reason that her child is delivered </p>
<p>(v. 29). We will elaborate on these points below.</p>
<p>First, Jesus’ rather laconic reply smacks of an unwillingness to help. </p>
<p>To be fair, this conclusion is gathered primarily from the words used. We </p>
<p>do not have access to the tone or manner in which these words were given. </p>
<p>A twinkle in the eye while speaking these words or an arming gesture </p>
<p>can mitigate the harshness of words and transform them into something </p>
