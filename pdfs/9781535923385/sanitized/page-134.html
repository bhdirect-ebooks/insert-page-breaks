<p>On the Road to Jerusalem</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>8:31—9:1116</p>
<p>about attaining life: new and true. So the comparison in vv. 36–37 warns </p>
<p>the disciples that the world and its glory cannot measure up to the great </p>
<p>value of life itself. Some English translations unfortunately obscures this by </p>
<p>translating the Greek psychē as “life” in v. 35 but “soul” in vv. 36–37.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>Hebraic thought the “soul” is the “life.”</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Hence, what is referred to is not the</p>
<p>immaterial portion of one’s being; rather it includes all that is human. All </p>
<p>that the world can oer is not worth life itself. So if a person gains the whole </p>
<p>world and loses his true life, he has not made a prot but a loss. And if he </p>
<p>discovers he has made a big mistake by engaging in that transaction, there is </p>
<p>no way back for him, as what he has gained is of a lower value than what he </p>
<p>has lost. He has irretrievably lost himself.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>e words of v. 38 are important for they promise the certainty of Je-</p>
<p>sus’ vindication. ey also serve the function of reinforcing the message of </p>
<p>vv. 35–37. Losing one’s true life is now dened by the Son of Man’s being </p>
<p>ashamed of that person. A sort of lex talionis is at work here. When one is </p>
<p>ashamed of Jesus, Jesus will be ashamed of him. What increases the stake to </p>
<p>immeasurable proportions is that this shaming is done when Jesus comes </p>
<p>in glory with his angels (i.e., at the irreversible eschaton). Being ashamed in </p>
<p>the ancient Semitic context means rejection. It usually has domestic conno-</p>
<p>tations, leading to the idea that being ashamed means treating that person </p>
<p>as not belonging to the family. is means the person is cut o from the </p>
<p>Messiah’s family, and because the setting is the eschaton, there is a dreaded </p>
<p>nality to it.</p>
<p>As such, v. 38 provides a counterpoint to the concept of the suer-</p>
<p>ing Son of Man. He will not always be suering, as though suering is the </p>
<p>supreme thing. No, he will claim his rightful status in God’s time, and be </p>
<p>gloried. e suering precedes the glory.</p>
<p>We come now to 9:1, which bristles with many diculties. “Will not </p>
<p>taste death” is a Semitic expression for death. In the Markan context the </p>
<p>statement refers to some of Jesus’ contemporaries, and not to the OT heroes </p>
<p>who were taken up to heaven, without having tasted death (e.g., Enoch, </p>
<p>Moses, and Elijah).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Jesus’ statement in 9:1 is also prefaced by the formula</p>
<p>“Amen I say to you,” reecting its sobriety and veracity. But what does he </p>
<p>mean by “the coming of the kingdom of God in power?”</p>

<p>10. Hartman 2010: 329–33.</p>
<p>11. Cf. Marcus 2009: 627–28, where he appeals to the notion of “eschatological life.”</p>
<p>12. Chilton 1987: 267–74.</p>
