<p>people. In this sense, the day of the Lord may also be a related concept to </p>
<p>God’s returning to Zion to reign (i.e., the kingdom of God). But since the </p>
<p>ushering in of the great day of the Lord is often related to the coming of the </p>
<p>Messiah, it is not surprising that scribes are depicted in Mark as believing </p>
<p>Elijah to be his herald. </p>
<p>The passage in Malachi also speaks of the restorative work of Elijah in </p>
<p>that he is expected to reconcile family members to each other. The LXX makes </p>
<p>this clear by translating the Hiphil of šûb with the Greek apokataste¯ sei. This </p>
<p>notion is enlarged upon in later Jewish thought to refer to all the tribes of </p>
<p>Israel. A ﬁne example is found in Ben Sira 48:10:</p>
<p>It is written that you are to come at the appointed time with warn-</p>
ings, to allay the divine wrath before its ﬁnal fury, to reconcile
<p>father and son, and to restore the tribes of Jacob.</p>
<p>Elijah’s coming at the eschaton is also attested in many other Jewish </p>
<p>sources (4Q558; m. ‘Ed 8:7), including its connection with the resurrection </p>
<p>(SibOr 2:187–88; m. Sota 9:15).</p>
<p>The Boy with the Unclean Spirit (9:14–29)</p>
<p>e group of disciples that were not involved in the Transguration event </p>
<p>failed to exorcise a demon-possessed boy, and a dispute arose between them </p>
<p>and the teachers of the law. e fact that the disciples have successfully cast </p>
<p>out demons before (6:13) makes their failure reprehensible. Indeed, exor-</p>
<p>cism is to be part and parcel of their kingdom work (3:15; 6:7).</p>
<p>It is puzzling why when the crowd see Jesus coming to them, they are </p>
<p>overwhelmed with wonder and run to greet him (v. 14). Usually in Mark’s </p>
<p>Gospel the crowd is astonished only aer witnessing a miracle (e.g., 1:22), </p>
<p>and not before. is has led some scholars to suggest that the glory of the </p>
<p>Transguration continues to linger on Jesus’ face,</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> or that Mark is continu-</p>
<p>ing his echoes of Exodus 34:29–35, which narrates also the people’s awe over </p>
<p>Moses’ shining face.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>An alternative is to think of it as an extravagant use of</p>
<p>the term by Mark to denote Jesus’ commanding presence.</p>
