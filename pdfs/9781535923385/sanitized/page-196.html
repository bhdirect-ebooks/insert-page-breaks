<p>process”).</p>
<p>82</p>
<p> Quite clearly, more is at stake. Furthermore, the events men-</p>
<p>tioned are oen connected with the end of the world in much Jewish and </p>
<p>pagan thought. In Jesus’ view, however, the events of v. 7 represent only the </p>
<p>beginning of birth pangs. e true “birth” is yet to come.</p>
<p>Persecution and Betrayal (13:9–13)</p>
<p>Such rumors of the end are harmless if they remain as such. But rumors can </p>
<p>whip up fervor, and fervor can bring about drastic actions. e disciples </p>
<p>must expect to nd themselves at the receiving end of an acrimonious at-</p>
<p>titude, especially if they do not conform to the national agenda inspired by </p>
<p>the Temple.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p> Since their message contradicts the expectation of the popu-</p>
<p>lace, or the propaganda of the religious or political authorities, they will be </p>
<p>persecuted. Astonishingly, the disciples are counselled to use such painful </p>
<p>circumstances for bearing witness (vv. 9–10). When arraigned before the </p>
<p>authorities, the disciples should not be afraid of being tongue-tied; neither </p>
<p>do they need to prepare an eloquent speech for their own justication. In-</p>
<p>stead, the Holy Spirit, the agent who inspired Jesus to preach the kingdom </p>
<p>message, will be with them to do the same.</p>
<p>Verse 10 has oen been misunderstood. Far from serving as a sign </p>
<p>for the end, it speaks actually of the indomitable progress of the gospel.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Interestingly, the one means of achieving this comes from the most unlikely </p>
<p>source. Persecution, far from hampering the growth of the gospel, results </p>
<p>in its spread instead. is means for the disciples that their one duty, when </p>
<p>under duress, is to bear witness to Jesus’ kingdom message.</p>
<p>Poignantly, the disciples will be opposed not just by ocial bodies but </p>
<p>also by family members. Verse 12 speaks of betrayal in a domestic setting, </p>
<p>alluding to Micah 7:6.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p> Such depraved actions can only mean the rise of in-</p>
<p>iquity, or a fanatical loyalty to the national agenda of preserving Jerusalem, </p>
<p>especially the Temple, to the detriment of everything else. Verse 13 sums up </p>
<p>the section by mentioning that the disciples will be hated by all because of </p>
<p>Jesus. In such a climate they are not to give up being disciples, but remain </p>

<p>83. e harsh punishments against Gentile trespassers (Philo, Embassy to Gaius, </p>
<p>212) and Jews who spoke/acted against the Temple (Josephus War 6:301; m. Sanh. 9:6) </p>
<p>provide evidence for us to believe that the lack of conformity to the Temple’s ideol-</p>
<p>ogy can bring about great reprisals. is would have been intensied when an external </p>
<p>threat to its safety loomed. On the topic of the temple as a national symbol of loyalty </p>
<p>and resistance see Borg 1984.</p>
