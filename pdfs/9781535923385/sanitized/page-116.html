<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>7:24–3698</p>
<p>playful.</p>
<p>173</p>
<p>In narrating a story, the apparently contradictory may be le in</p>
<p>suspense by which the plot thickens. e resolution at the end will shed </p>
<p>light on the apparently contradictory.</p>
<p>Secondly, the phrase “permit rst” with which Jesus begins his reply </p>
<p>is pregnant with meaning. What is signicant is that there is no mention </p>
<p>of a sequel. e gaping semantic ditch must be leapt across by the woman </p>
<p>herself. We may assume the woman picked up the implication and did the </p>
<p>semantic leap. So Jesus’ answer would have come across as “not yet,” rather </p>
<p>than a at “no.” We shall see later that the woman actually went further than </p>
<p>this implication.</p>
<p>irdly, the image is highly suggestive. Dogs may still eat of the crumbs </p>
<p>that fall from the children’s table, without arrogating to themselves what </p>
<p>rightfully belongs to the children. eologically speaking, the meal may al-</p>
<p>lude to the banquet of the last days that God will throw for his children (cf. </p>
<p>Isa 25:6). is concerns the restoration of Israel in which the nation will </p>
<p>nally dine in perfect fellowship with God. It is thus connected with the </p>
<p>actualizing of the eschatological kingship of God. Once this is grasped, the </p>
<p>sequence inherent in the image may be seen as speaking of salvation his-</p>
<p>tory. Restoration and redemption must rst come to Jews, because of God’s </p>
<p>promises to the patriarchs. e eschatological pilgrimage of the Gentiles </p>
<p>takes place aer Mt Zion is raised to the highest heights (Isa 2:2–4; 49:6). </p>
is divine sequence must be respected. Indeed, this should be something
<p>the Gentile audience of Mark could also celebrate. If God reneged on his </p>
<p>promises to Israel, it would oer no comfort to the Gentiles, as he could eas-</p>
<p>ily renege on those he made to the Church. Furthermore, the word “bread” </p>
<p>connects us immediately with the feeding miracle in the previous chapter </p>
<p>and the feeding miracle in the next. As we shall see later, the later feeding </p>
<p>miracle is performed for Gentiles. ese stories ll out the meaning of the </p>
<p>words “rst.”</p>
<p>Finally, the woman’s reply demonstrates she understands Jesus’ hints </p>
<p>about the theology undergirding the image. In fact, her understanding </p>
<p>went further than the boundaries dictated by the redemptive sequence, and </p>
<p>grasps the character of the One behind it all. Rightly so, Mark’s emphasis is </p>
<p>on her reply (v. 29) because it accepts the validity of Jesus’ image. However, </p>
<p>it also furthers the image boldly and legitimately for her daughter’s benet: </p>
<p>the dogs may eat of the crumbs now. e woman is not using extraneous </p>
<p>arguments or appealing to extrinsic considerations. Everything in her reply </p>
<p>comes from the image Jesus has used. is certainly evidences submission </p>
<p>to the lordship of Jesus. However, it also evinces a clear grasp of the presence </p>
<p>173. E.g., Camery-Hoggart 1992: 150–51; and Filson 1960: 180.</p>
