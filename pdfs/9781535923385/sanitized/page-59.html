<p>his disciples by appealing to an OT precedent (vv. 25–26), concluding with </p>
<p>a pronouncement on the real meaning of the Sabbath (vv. 27–28).</p>
<p>e Sabbath commandment was rst given in Exodus 20:10 and it </p>
<p>serves as a pointer both to creation (Gen 2:2–3) and to the Exodus. In this </p>
<p>respect it may also be regarded as a sign of the covenant, reminding the Jews </p>
<p>of their covenantal status. Crassly understood, it forbids work on that day, </p>
<p>but when it is set within the framework of creation and Exodus, it should </p>
<p>also be viewed positively, such as rest and worship. What sort of activity </p>
<p>is regarded as forbidden work, and by what criterion should such a deci-</p>
<p>sion be made, have naturally led to some debates among Jews. e Qumran </p>
<p>community applied it strictly and forbade even the humanitarian action of </p>
<p>helping an animal or a man out of a pit on Sabbath day (CD 11:13–17).</p>
<p>e disciples’ plucking grain to eat reects the Jewish institution of </p>
<p>pe’ah , which has its basis in the Torah (Lev 19:9–10; 23:22; Deut 23:24–25). </p>
<p>is was promulgated for the sustenance of the poor and the destitute. At </p>
<p>issue in the text is whether the disciples are breaking a Sabbath regulation, </p>
<p>as Exod 34:21 expressly forbids reaping on that day. Philo of Alexandria </p>
<p>conrms this when he writes (in the rst century) that Jews are not allowed </p>
<p>to pluck fruit or cut any tree or plant on the Sabbath (Life of Moses 2.22; cf. </p>
<p>the rabbinic pronouncement in m. Sab. 7:2). So the controversy is not over </p>
<p>whether Jesus’ disciples could feed themselves on a Sabbath day, but over </p>
<p>what they were doing to feed themselves.</p>
<p>Jesus defends his disciples’ actions by appealing to David’s example in </p>
<p>1 Sam 21:1–9. is incident probably took place on a Sabbath day, since the </p>
<p>bread was presented before God each Sabbath (Lev 24:8).</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>It is clear from</p>
<p>1 Sam 21:1–9 that Ahimelech was the high priest, and not his son Abiathar. </p>
<p>Has Mark made a mistake in v. 26?</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>Much depends on how the Greek phrase epi Abiathar archiereōs is to </p>
<p>be understood, principally the construction epi + genitive. In Mark 12:26 </p>
<p>the same epi + genitive construction is found (in this case epi tou batou), </p>
<p>which does not mean “upon the burning bush,” but “in the account of the </p>
<p>burning bush” (i.e., construing the epi + genitive as having locative force). </p>
<p>So Mark may then be regarded as meaning “in the section of scripture hav-</p>
<p>ing to do with Abiathar”</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> in the present passage. Even so, it is hard to un-</p>
<p>derstand how 1 Sam 21 may be regarded as a passage featuring Abiathar the </p>
<p>high priest. He is not even mentioned.</p>
<p>48. According to a Jewish tradition, the bread was removed and eaten by priests at </p>
<p>the next Sabbath (Midrash Rabbah Lev. 32: 3).</p>
