<p>be strong, but he should not be expected to contradict his own paramount </p>
<p>interest of showing that Jesus’ miracles stem from his own authority. e </p>
<p>explanation of Glöckner should be considered seriously: unbelief makes a </p>
<p>miracle not so much impossible as meaningless, and therefore in most cases </p>
<p>futile.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>It bears mentioning that there is something signicant in the way that </p>
<p>Jesus was described (v. 3). Jesus is called Mary’s son, which is somewhat </p>
<p>peculiar. Indeed, nowhere else in the canonical Gospels is Jesus called as </p>
<p>such (cf. Luke 4:22; John 1:45; 6:42 where he is known as “son of Joseph”). </p>
<p>It may be that some sort of derision is implied (i.e., Jesus was regarded as an </p>
<p>illegitimate child, and Mark is alluding to the virgin birth of Jesus, which is </p>
<p>perniciously reinterpreted by those who do not believe in this claim).</p>
<p>125</p>
<p> Al-</p>
<p>ternatively, it may indicate that Joseph is dead and so it becomes possible to </p>
<p>call a son by his mother’s name (cf. 3:31). However, the usual practice is still </p>
<p>to identify the son by the name of his deceased father (see b.Yoma 38b).</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>e episode ends with a description of Jesus’ amazement (v. 6), an-</p>
<p>swering the amazement of the townspeople (v. 2). e datum of Jesus’ </p>
<p>amazement is found only here in Mark’s Gospel, which may be construed </p>
<p>ironically. Lack of faith in Jesus is the really amazing thing, especially by </p>
<p>people who should know him better. Once again, Mark ends his cycle of </p>
<p>stories on a downbeat. But all this becomes a foil to the importance of faith.</p>
<p>Mission Furthered and Martyrdom Foreshadowed </p>
<p>(6.6b–30)</p>
<p>e sending out of the Twelve for mission, and their return to give a re-</p>
<p>port to Jesus, frame the story of the death of John the Baptist. rough the </p>
<p>intercalation of stories, Mark also ties up some loose ends. In the earlier </p>
<p>chapters, Mark’s audience was informed there were two aspects to the call of </p>
<p>disciples: to be Jesus’ envoys to extend his ministry (1:16–20; 3:14–15), and </p>
<p>also to be with him (3:14) in order that they may receive instruction and </p>
<p>training. e latter aspect has been well developed (see especially 4:10, 34), </p>
<p>but not the former. is is precisely what Mark makes good at this juncture. </p>
<p>Furthermore, although Mark has mentioned the arrest of John the Baptist </p>
<p>earlier (1:14), he did not describe the circumstances leading to it. is lack </p>

<p>125. Wilson 1995: 188. See the judicious discussion in Marcus, especially the refu-</p>
<p>tation that the matronym is used because Jesus’ siblings had a dierent mother (Marcus </p>
<p>2000: 374–75).</p>
<p>126. Cf. McArthur 1973: 38–58 in which he proposes that no slur was intended. But </p>
<p>this is untenable. See the apt comments of Marcus 2000: 375.</p>
