<p>On the Road to Jerusalem</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<p>Judea, and crossing the river Jordan to arrive at Perea. While the itinerary is </p>
<p>strange, it is not impossible. What is more pertinent is that this topographi-</p>
<p>cal note brings us back to the territory of Herod Antipas. e Markan audi-</p>
<p>ence does not need reminding that John the Baptist was beheaded precisely </p>
because of his criticism of Herod’s divorce and subsequent remarriage to
<p>Herodias. In this light, the mention of the Pharisees as intending to test or </p>
trick Jesus by asking a question about divorce is apt (v. 2). Moreover, many Jews, and even the Pharisees themselves, are divided over such an issue (see
<p>excursus). Jesus is therefore put in a tricky situation. An unwise answer </p>
<p>could land him in hot soup.</p>
<p>Excursus: Jewish Attitudes Towards Divorce</p>
<p>Although there were debates among Jews about what constituted legitimate </p>
grounds for divorce, all sides, except probably the Qumran community, took it as a given that divorce was allowed. The biblical text which was often re-
<p>ferred to in such controversies was Deut 24:1–4. In the ﬁrst-century Jewish </p>
<p>world, the famous opponents in such debates were Hillel and Shammai, </p>
<p>two prominent rabbis. The former may be regarded as holding a liberal view </p>
<p>while the latter held the conservative view. In m. Git. 9:10, we have this </p>
<p>interesting account:</p>
The School of Shammai say: A man may not divorce his wife unless
<p>he had found unchastity in her, for it is written, “Because he hath </p>
<p>found in her indecency in anything [Deut 24.1].” And the School </p>
of Hillel say: [He may divorce her] even if she spoiled a dish for
<p>him, for it is written, “Because he hath found in her indecency in </p>
<p>anything.” R. Akiba says: Even if he found another fairer than she, </p>
<p>for it is written, “And it shall be if she ﬁnds no favor in his eyes </p>
<p>[Deut 24.1] …”</p>
<p>The italicized words identify the concepts the different schools em-</p>
phasized to build their ethics on. The School of Shammai allowed divorce
<p>only on the ground of unchastity, while the School of Hillel allowed it for </p>
<p>many other reasons. The strictest view of all, which was almost identical </p>
<p>with that of Jesus, came from the Qumran community. They prohibited </p>
divorce: certainly for leaders, but also probably for all its members (cf. CD
<p>4:20—5:2; 11QT 57:17–19).</p>
