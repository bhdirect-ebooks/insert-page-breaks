<p>The Compound Question (v. 4) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHEN will these things happen? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHAT will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled? </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Answer (vv. 5-37) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A PROPHECIES relating to the destruction of the Temple (vv. 5-23) </p>
<p>B PROPHECIES relating to the Parousia of the Son of Man (vv. 24-27)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A&apos; TIMEFRAME for the destruction of the Temple (vv. 28-31) </p>
<p>B&apos; TIMEFRAME for the Parousia of the Son of Man (vv. 32-37)</p>

<p>e form the disciples’ questions take (v. 2) may be collapsed into a com-</p>
<p>pound question with two aspects: the rst asks for the time, while the </p>
<p>second, the sign. is may be further construed as presupposing two inter-</p>
<p>related events, namely the destruction of the Temple and the coming of the </p>
<p>Son of Man. One of the earliest interpreters of Mark, the evangelist Mat-</p>
<p>thew, understood it in that way (Matt 24:3).</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>As to the structure, we note</p>
<p>that v. 23 serves as a signicant marker where it is stated all that needed </p>
<p>to be foretold has been said. Hence, vv. 5–23 may be construed as form-</p>
<p>ing one block, which may of course be broken down into smaller units. </p>
<p>Furthermore, vv. 24–27 evince a dierent sort of language, concentrating </p>
<p>on celestial phenomena. In this regard, they may be construed as forming </p>
<p>another block. With v. 28, the material focuses on the time aspect, and may </p>
<p>justiably be broken down into two blocks of vv. 28–31 and vv. 32–37. All </p>
<p>this produces an ABA’B’ structure. e structure also shows that the two </p>
<p>questions the disciples asked are answered in reverse order: the events (or </p>
<p>signs leading to the key events) are rst discussed (A and B material), fol-</p>
<p>lowed by the teaching on the time (A’ and B’ material). We will now examine </p>
<p>the passage closely.</p>
<p>e Setting (13:1–4)</p>
<p>is paragraph gives the audience the setting of the discourse. As such, it </p>
<p>oers them and us an important hermeneutical reference point. It is impor-</p>
<p>tant to note that what prompted the discourse is the disciples’ awe over the </p>
<p>Temple, and their subsequent question about its predicted destruction. In </p>
<p>76. We presuppose here the cogency of the Two Document Hypothesis.</p>
