<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>4:1–3462</p>
<p>are the “insiders” (i.e., people who are open to what God is doing in Jesus’ </p>
<p>ministry), are promised more revelation and insight. For those who do not </p>
<p>have this attitude, even the little insight they once had will soon be gone. </p>
<p>Rejection does not mean the status quo is preserved; instead, it leads to a </p>
<p>downward spiral. e verse does not identify who takes this away. It could </p>
<p>be Satan (cf. 4:15) or God.</p>
<p>Two Seed Parables (4:26–32)</p>
<p>Two seed parables are found here. rough them, the parable connection </p>
<p>with the kingdom of God is made explicit.</p>
<p>For the rst time, the phrase “this is what the kingdom of God is like” </p>
<p>is used to preface a parable (v. 26). is parable is about the germinating </p>
<p>seed, growing without any human input (vv. 26–29). What is emphasized is </p>
<p>the inscrutability of the growth of the kingdom, but the results are assured </p>
<p>and will be clear to all. e Greek of the nal two clauses in v. 29 echoes the </p>
<p>Greek translation of Joel 3:13 (LXX 4:13). e latter speaks of eschatological </p>
<p>judgment against God’s enemies. If the echo is intentional, Jesus appears to </p>
<p>be using it with a dierent nuance: to speak positively of the nal results of </p>
<p>the kingdom.</p>
<p>e second parable is about the mustard seed (vv. 30–32), which de-</p>
<p>velops further the idea of the previous one. e kingdom’s goal will not only </p>
<p>be reached inexorably, it will be more glorious than its inauspicious begin-</p>
<p>nings. Consequently, a more arresting image is used: not just any seed but </p>
<p>the mustard seed. e Greek phrase mikroteron hon pantōn tōn spermatōn </p>
<p>epi tēs gēs is literally “the smallest of all seeds on the earth,” which may cause </p>
<p>diculty for some readers. is seed is probably the black mustard (brassica </p>
<p>nigra), which is extremely small but can grow to a height of about ten feet. </p>
<p>Although it is not the smallest seed on Earth, it is proverbial for its smallness </p>
<p>(m. Nid. 5:2; m. Naz. 1:5). is proverbially small seed will become a plant </p>
<p>that is the greatest of garden plants. On its branches birds of the air will </p>
<p>make their homes. e image of birds nesting in this plant recalls the OT </p>
<p>promises of the entry of Gentiles to the kingdom (Ezek 17:23; 31:6 [LXX]; </p>
<p>Dan 4:20–22; cf. 1 En. 90:30). So glorious will the kingdom be that Israel </p>
<p>will not be the only beneciary; the nations of the world will also be drawn </p>
<p>into it, for God is the king of all creation. is prepares the Markan audience </p>
<p>for the story he will narrate in the next chapter.</p>
<p>e two seed parables then convey the notion that the kingdom comes </p>
<p>not as a giant tree transplanted from heaven, an image which may accu-</p>
<p>rately describe much of Jewish eschatological speculation (cf. the “cosmic </p>
