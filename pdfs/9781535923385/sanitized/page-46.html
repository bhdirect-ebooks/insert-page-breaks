<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>1:16–4528</p>
<p>formulas or incantations, or make appeal to God’s word. A simple com-</p>
<p>mand is issued and there is no tussle. Perhaps this is the signicance of the </p>
<p>crowd’s confession that ends the story: “He commands even the unclean </p>
<p>spirits and they obey him” (1:27).</p>
<p>Fihly, the demon reveals the true identity of Jesus. us far, the true </p>
<p>identity of Jesus has not been fully revealed to or discerned by people. e </p>
<p>voice that spoke in 1:11 was probably meant only for Jesus to hear. Indeed, </p>
<p>Mark’s narrative has this characteristic: demonic forces know Jesus’ identity </p>
<p>but people continue to puzzle over it.</p>
<p>Finally, Jesus commands silence. Why? It may be that unclean entities </p>
<p>are not allowed to confess the identity of clean entities. More probably, it is </p>
<p>part and parcel of an important theme in Mark: the theme of secrecy. Mark </p>
<p>will narrate many stories hereaer exhibiting a similar phenomenon. Why </p>
<p>this is so will be claried only when the whole Gospel has been read.</p>
<p>Once the tone is set, Mark goes on to show another aspect of Jesus’ </p>
<p>ministry: healing (vv. 29–31). Interestingly, the healing is performed on </p>
<p>Peter’s mother-in-law, to rid her of fever. By a simple grasping of her hand, </p>
<p>Jesus raises her from bed (v. 31). Upon being healed, she serves Jesus and </p>
<p>his company. Some scholars detect here a paradigm for discipleship.</p>

<p>e</p>
<p>raising of Peter’s mother-in-law is analogous to resurrection from spiritual </p>
<p>death, and her immediate service to Jesus sets the example for later believ-</p>
<p>ers: they are raised so as to serve.</p>
<p>Widening of Jesus’ Ministry (1:35–39)</p>
<p>e story hints at Jesus’ prayer-life (the Greek imperfect prosēucheto sug-</p>
<p>gests habitual praying).Mark mentions three times that Jesus prays, and </p>
<p>these reports are made at important moments of his ministry: here at the </p>
<p>beginning of his ministry; in 6:46 aer the feeding of the 5,000 (John 6:15 </p>
<p>tells us the crowds want to make Jesus king because of this miracle); and in </p>
<p>14:32–42, where the Father’s will is armed and unswervingly followed in </p>
<p>the Garden of Gethsemane.</p>
<p>e description of Jesus’ praying, the comment of Peter and Jesus’ re-</p>
<p>sponse may be seen as a whole. rough prayer the temptation of reveling </p>
<p>in a celebrity status is preempted, and one’s calling from God is armed </p>
<p>and strengthened. Hence, instead of meeting those who were so desirous of </p>
<p>seeing him, Jesus declares the one reason for his having come is to preach </p>
<p>the gospel. is must mean leaving Capernaum—even if he was treated as </p>
<p>a celebrity there—in order to go to other villages which have yet to hear </p>
<p>his message. rough this cameo, Mark achieves elegantly his purpose of </p>
<p>10. Boring 2006: 66.</p>
