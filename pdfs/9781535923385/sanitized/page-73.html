<p>e Kingdom in Parables 55</p>
<p>bring Israel back from her exile.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> It has also been suggested by some com-</p>
<p>mentators that the sower in the parable could also be Jesus.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>A familiar scene taken from the agrarian context of his listeners is </p>
<p>used: a small landholder casts seed in all types of soil in the hope of getting </p>
<p>optimal yield.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>He would also sow seeds before ploughing (cf. Jub. 11:11;</p>
<p>t. Sab. 7:2; b. Sab. 73b).</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>e parable is constructed artfully and uses ideas</p>
<p>which are easy to follow. Seeds are sown on four dierent types of terrain: </p>
<p>the ground beside the path, the rocky places, the thorny patches, and good </p>
<p>soil. e seeds face dierent conditions and give dierent results. ese are </p>
<p>arranged in the form of a gradation: no germination → quick germination </p>
<p>but also quick termination → no fruit → abundant fruit.</p>
<p>e rst terrain is properly “the ground beside the path,”</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>in keeping</p>
<p>with the Greek para tēn hodon, and not “along the path,” as it is in many </p>
<p>English versions. is is the unplowed part of the eld. e seeds on it are </p>
<p>easily accessible to birds. More importantly, such a description may be theo-</p>
<p>logically loaded, because the word hodos (way) is used positively in Mark </p>
<p>to represent the “way” of three intimately related entities: the way of the </p>
<p>gospel (1:2), the way of Jesus (8:27; 10:32), and the way of discipleship (9:33; </p>
<p>10:52).</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>So the people who are represented by the ground that is “beside the</p>
<p>path” are those who do not belong to the way. As a result, the seed or word </p>
<p>is taken immediately from them. Feeding birds are oen an ominous image </p>
<p>(Gen 40:17, 19; Deut 28:26; 1 Kings 14:11; 16:4; Ps 79:2; Isa 18:6; Jer 7:33; </p>
<p>34:20; Ezek 29:5; 32:4; cf. Jub. 11:11).</p>
<p>e second are the rocky places. Terrain of this nature has only a thin </p>
<p>layer of soil, which does not allow the germinating plant to take root deeply. </p>
<p>Exposed to the scorching sun, it will wither quickly. e description that </p>
<p>the plant sprang up quickly in such a terrain has puzzled many readers, as </p>
<p>there is no scientic basis for it. Perhaps the solution lies in construing the </p>
<p>parable as adopting an observer’s perspective. Seeds sown on rocky terrain </p>
<p>are nearer the surface as compared to seeds sown on ploughed soil. As it </p>
<p>takes a shorter time for the shoot to break out from this thin soil, it gives </p>
<p>the impression that it germinates more rapidly. e point of the descrip-</p>
<p>tion lies in the contrast: quick growth but shallow roots. “Rootlessness” is a </p>
