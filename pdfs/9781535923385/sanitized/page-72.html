<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>4:1–3454</p>
<p>reasons. e rst is that Jesus ministered in what is largely an agrarian so-</p>
<p>ciety. Farming images would be most suitable for his listeners. Secondly, </p>
<p>the image of planting and harvesting is frequently used in the OT to con-</p>
<p>vey God’s creative work in the nation, especially his restorative work (Hos </p>
<p>2:21–23; Amos 9:13–15; Zech 8:12). Jewish eschatological discourses make </p>
<p>use of such an image too (cf. 2 Bar. 70:2). Moreover, the seed is most con-</p>
<p>genial for representing the restorative word of God which works to bring </p>
<p>about his eschatological will (cf. Isa 55:10–11; 4 Ezra 8:41; 9:31). Indeed, in </p>
<p>Jer 31:27–28, the image of sowing seed is used in relation to the prophecy </p>
<p>of the repopulation of Israel and Judah. Finally, the image of seed conveys </p>
<p>aptly the nature of the kingdom. Just as a seed is hidden in the soil but will </p>
<p>germinate to bring forth life and fruit, so also will the kingdom be hidden, </p>
<p>but its eect will be tangible and unstoppable.</p>
<p>Parable of the Sower (4:1–9)</p>
<p>e setting (v. 1) serves to raise the expectation that something spectacu-</p>
<p>lar is about to happen because it contains a hyperbole. Usually crowds are </p>
<p>just described as “great” (3:7–8; cf. 5:21; 6:34; 8:1; 9:14; 12:37), but in 4:1, </p>
<p>Mark uses the Greek phrase ochlos pleistos, which means literally “the great-</p>
<p>est crowd.” is “mammoth” crowd has gathered at the shore of the lake </p>
<p>to listen to Jesus and subsequently he has to use the boat as a vehicle for </p>
<p>teaching. Verse 2 tells us that Jesus teaches in parables, but the focus will </p>
<p>just be on one.</p>
<p>Two verbs are joined in the opening statement of Jesus: “listen” and </p>
<p>“look.”</p>
<p>79</p>
<p> e implication is that mere listening is not enough. e listen-</p>
<p>ers must also perceive. In other words, their hearing should lead to a new </p>
<p>outlook. To be sure, the importance of “hearing” is not to be belittled, as it </p>
<p>occurs again in vv. 9, 12, 15–16, 18, 20, 23–24, 33, and especially so when it </p>
<p>is the rst word of the Shema</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>(see Deut 6:4–5). e upshot of all this is that</p>
<p>something important is being conveyed by Jesus, and it will take one’s total </p>
<p>concentration and keen perception to grasp his meaning.</p>
<p>e parable speaks of a sower (the Greek is ho speirōn). ere may be </p>
<p>an allusion to Jer 31:27–28, which pictures God as a sower who works to </p>
<p>79. English translations sometimes use only one verb (e.g., NRSV), denuding the </p>
<p>statement of an important nuance.</p>
<p>80. Cf. Gerhardsson 1967–68: 165–93, who argues that the whole parable may be </p>
<p>interpreted with reference to the Shema.</p>
