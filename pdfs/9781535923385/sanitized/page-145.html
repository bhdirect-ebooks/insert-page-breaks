<p>e Second Passion Prediction and Sundry Discipleship Lessons 127</p>
<p>a society shaped signicantly by the honor-shame dynamic, this key lesson </p>
<p>must be learned repeatedly if the disciples are to walk in the way of Jesus.</p>
<p>e Second Passion Prediction (9:30–32)</p>
<p>Mark tells us expressly that the second Passion Prediction is given in the </p>
<p>interest of discipleship (vv. 30–31). One item of information not found in </p>
<p>the rst Passion Prediction is the prediction of betrayal. e Greek verb </p>
<p>paradidōmi, which is used by Mark, does not in itself mean that. e techni-</p>
<p>cal term for this is prodidōmi or, if the noun is used, prodotēs. at said, </p>
<p>its root meaning of “being handed over” may be used to depict adequately </p>
<p>such an idea, especially when the word was used in 3:19 to characterize </p>
<p>the infamous disciple of Jesus. e present tense in Greek tells us that the </p>
<p>process of betrayal has started. For the characters of the story, this is the rst </p>
<p>time Jesus mentions he will be betrayed. is may explain why the disciples </p>
<p>are baed by Jesus’ prediction (v. 32).</p>
<p>True Greatness (9:33–37)</p>
<p>e story is situated in a house in Capernaum. We have noted how signi-</p>
<p>cant Capernaum is to Mark’s Gospel (1:21–27; 2:1–12). Furthermore, the </p>
<p>house is the place where special instruction, primarily for Jesus’ disciples, </p>
<p>is given. e conversation between Jesus and his disciples is occasioned by </p>
<p>an argument among his disciples (v. 33). e phrase “on the road” is linked </p>
<p>with discipleship—discipleship being following in the way of Jesus (cf. 8:27; </p>
<p>10:32–45).</p>
<p>What follows is a piece of teaching that speaks of a total reversal of </p>
<p>conventional attitudes. Being great is not having the ability to command </p>
<p>others to serve, but to be the one who serves all. True greatness must always </p>
<p>be tied up with a servant’s heart. Once this is grasped, it means that the </p>
<p>argument on the road should not have arisen at all. Mark will return to this </p>
<p>topic at 10:35–45.</p>
<p>Jesus uses a child to illustrate his teaching. In rst century Palestine, </p>
<p>the child was not usually regarded as a precious little thing who exemplied </p>
<p>what trusting means, as is commonly understood in many Christian circles </p>
<p>today. Instead, the child was regarded as a minor: someone without status </p>
<p>and easily ignored.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>e one without status is thus linked with Jesus and the</p>
<p>Father. To receive someone was also an important social convention (Acts </p>
<p>18:27–28; Gal 4:14; Did. 11:1–2; 12:1). is was usually extended to equals </p>
<p>33. Donahue and Harrington 2002: 285.</p>
