<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>3:13–4550</p>
<p>Mark locates the family contingent “outside.” is may be coded lan-</p>
<p>guage to refer not just to a physical position but also to a theological posi-</p>
<p>tion (i.e., although they might be Jesus’ physical kin, they were not truly his </p>
<p>family). </p>
<p>Jesus asks about kinship (v. 33) and his reply to his own question is as-</p>
<p>tonishing (vv. 34–35). e family bond was regarded as almost sacred in the </p>
<p>rst century Palestinian context, because of the h commandment (Exod </p>
<p>20:12). us for Jesus to speak of his real family as comprising those who </p>
<p>obey God, and not those who are related to him by blood, serves to relativ-</p>
<p>ize the importance of such blood ties. Of course, Jews would accept that </p>
<p>God’s claims supersede those of family. However, to claim that those who </p>
<p>obey God are Jesus’ mother, brother, and sister goes beyond this in some </p>
<p>ways in that a new type of kinship is envisaged. Such a concept dovetails </p>
<p>with the story of 3:13–19, which connotes the idea of Jesus’ creating the new </p>
<p>people of God, through the calling of the Twelve.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the answer of Jesus does not contain the all-important </p>
<p>word “father.” ere may be two possible explanations for this. It may be </p>
<p>that Jesus is adapting his answer to the situation. Joseph is not there and </p>
<p>so there is no need to mention who his father is. Alternatively, Jesus may </p>
<p>be thinking of his special relationship with God who is known to him as </p>
<p>Abba.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>is may also allude to the virgin birth of Jesus. Of course, both</p>
<p>explanations need not be regarded as being mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit</p>
<p>The blasphemy against the Holy Spirit has intrigued many people. Modern </p>
<p>readers, anxious to know whether they or their close relatives have commit-</p>
<p>ted it, often ask what Jesus is referring to exactly. Not surprisingly, many </p>
<p>theories have been propounded throughout the history of the Church to </p>
<p>explain it.</p>
<p>We present here the biblical perspective, assuming that the OT forms </p>
<p>a continuum with the NT. It may surprise many that what is being referred </p>
<p>to is actually clear but what is unclear is the logic that is at work. The </p>
<p>blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is committed when opponents of Jesus </p>
<p>ascribe his exorcisms to the work of Beelzeboul. This is so because the Holy </p>
<p>Spirit is the power behind Jesus’ distinctive exorcisms. But why should this </p>
<p>blasphemy be regarded as an eternal sin without the possibility of forgive-</p>
