<p>Christology 229</p>
<p>Son of God is seen. In other words, Christology is profoundly linked to the </p>
<p>cross.</p>
<p>Hence, the secrecy theme arises not just from Jesus’ clear grasp of the </p>
<p>currents of his day, but also from his vision of what the kingdom is, his </p>
<p>understanding of his role in it, and his unique identity. Although these are </p>
<p>profoundly connected with Israel’s scriptures and covenant, they come to </p>
<p>full expression only in the event of the cross and resurrection (9:9). e </p>
<p>theme serves then as a foil to a deeper understanding of Christology and </p>
<p>Jesus’ kingdom theology, which we will explore in the next section.</p>
<p>Since this series is entitled New Covenant Commentary Series, some-</p>
<p>thing about Jesus and the covenant has to be said. e theme is not explicit, </p>
<p>but it may be cogently argued that it functions as the invisible glue that holds </p>
<p>things together. Indeed, as Sanders has reminded us, the theme of covenant </p>
<p>holds the worldview of the Jews together even if it is seldom expressed.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>it is a worthwhile venture to examine this theme in Mark.</p>
<p>e term covenant (the Greek for this is diathēkē) occurs only once </p>
<p>in Mark, but it is found at a highly signicant passage (14:24). ere Jesus </p>
<p>explains what the meaning of his death is, which is also the meaning of his </p>
<p>vocation. e inescapable conclusion is that Jesus’ death must be under-</p>
<p>stood in covenantal terms. If Jesus establishes a covenant by his blood, it </p>
<p>implies that what Moses has ratied before is no longer ecacious. Such </p>
<p>a trend of thought is not unprecedented, as the OT story is one in which </p>
<p>covenant-breaking on the part of Israel is highlighted. is was what the </p>
<p>exile meant. However, prophets looked to a time when God would estab-</p>
<p>lish an everlasting or new covenant with Israel that would be immune from </p>
<p>further breaches. e OT does not clarify whether this would be an entirely </p>
<p>new covenant or a renewal of a broken one. Happily, how this question is </p>
<p>resolved does not aect what we are here explicating. What obtains from </p>
<p>all this is that the OT attests to an ongoing story of God and his people, </p>
<p>dened by the covenant, which has yet to receive closure. Using this lens </p>
<p>to look at Jesus’ ministry, one can then say that Jesus conceived of his voca-</p>
<p>tion, especially his death, as the climax of this covenantal story, in which an </p>
<p>eschatological covenant is established that would create the new people of </p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>Covenantal ideas are found not only in the Last Supper passage, but </p>
<p>may be regarded as profoundly undergirding Jesus’ preaching of the king-</p>
<p>dom. In Jesus’ explanation of why his disciples do not need to fast, he uses the </p>
<p>metaphor of the bridegroom at his wedding (2:18–20). As we have argued </p>
<p>in our exegesis, the primary background for understanding this metaphor </p>
