<p>On the Road to Jerusalem</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>9:2–13118</p>
<p>speaks of a nal vindication (8:38), but also predicts a foretaste of it in the </p>
<p>near future (9:1).</p>
<p>Transfiguration and Transformation of Expectations </p>
<p>(9:2–13)</p>
<p>When the rst Passion prediction was made (8:31), it was so controversial </p>
<p>that even Jesus’ chief disciple rebuked him (8:32). e Transguration may </p>
<p>then be understood as an event designed for the disciples, to vindicate Je-</p>
<p>sus, especially his view of his vocation as the suering Messiah. Not only </p>
<p>is he vindicated by God, his hidden glory is also allowed to emanate for </p>
<p>just a moment, indicating that suering and glory need not be regarded as </p>
<p>incompatible.</p>
<p>e conversation that takes place aer the event (vv. 9–13) focuses on </p>
<p>the suering aspect of the kingdom. Not only must the Son of Man suer </p>
<p>and be rejected, but the eschatological Elijah has also been maltreated by </p>
<p>humans. So the whole section (vv. 2–13) shows that the opposite poles of </p>
<p>suering and glory may be reconciled in Jesus. is is the lesson the dis-</p>
<p>ciples must learn as they grapple with the mystery of the kingdom and the </p>
<p>mystery of Jesus’ messiahship.</p>
<p>e Transguration (9:2–8)</p>
<p>Mark informs his audience that this event takes place aer six days, presum-</p>
<p>ably from the time Jesus made his discipleship demands in the previous </p>
<p>story. Jesus takes his three closest disciples up to a high mountain (v. 2). </p>
<p>Where this place is, we do not know and probably the adjective “high” is </p>
<p>meant to speak more of theology than topography (see excursus). Mark </p>
<p>describes what happens to Jesus with the word metamorphoō, which means </p>
<p>basically a change in form.</p>
<p>Excursus: The Place of Jesus’ Transﬁguration</p>
<p>The place is not speciﬁed but a time note is given, which is rare in Mark. </p>
<p>Using the time note as a cue and the description that the mountain is high, </p>
<p>some scholars have conjectured this place must be within a six-day reach </p>
<p>from Caesarea Philippi. The one high mountain that is reachable in six </p>
<p>days is Mt Hermon, which is 9230 feet in height and about twenty miles </p>
<p>northeast of Caesarea Philippi. This would be a spectacular candidate and </p>
