<p>e Eschatological Discourse ontheMountofOlives 181</p>
<p>(iv) is popular amongst Christians brought up on a dispensationalist diet, </p>
<p>but the trouble with this is that it sucks away any relevance the discourse </p>
<p>may have for the disciples. Instead, it makes the discourse relevant only for </p>
<p>the last generation before Christ comes. is makes us wonder whether it is </p>
<p>relevant for us now, as we have no way of knowing whether we are the last </p>
<p>generation. Sadly, this plays into the hands of many exploitative preachers.</p>
<p>Option (ii) ts the prediction of v. 14 best. In the winter of AD 67/8, </p>
<p>the Zealot party occupied the Temple and appointed by lot the reluctant </p>
<p>Phanias as the high priest. Josephus informs us Phanias did not have the </p>
<p>slightest clue what such an oce entailed. He was forcefully dragged from </p>
<p>his abode, draped in priestly vestments and taught how to sacrice! is </p>
<p>mockery of the high priestly oce aroused popular indignation, which in </p>
<p>turn led to internecine bloodshed in the Temple (Josephus War 4:147–57, </p>
<p>201). All this shows that what the Temple was meant to symbolize in God’s </p>
<p>intention was no longer respected. Instead, it had become the place for the </p>
<p>shedding of blood, deling the sacred place. Moreover, it had also become </p>
<p>the symbol not of God’s presence but of great iniquity in Israel. However, </p>
<p>this great aront to God was not apparent to many Jews. ey probably </p>
<p>thought that if Zealots were sinners, the Romans were even greater sinners. </p>
<p>So many Jews remained convinced that God would still protect the Temple, </p>
<p>even if their own people were not getting their act right. Tragically they </p>
<p>failed to see that the woes of the nation were not brought about by external </p>
<p>forces, but by their own iniquity.</p>
<p>Once the sign is seen, the disciples are to “ee to the mountains.” is </p>
<p>means abandoning the cause of Jerusalem, and eeing to places of refuge. </p>
<p>Instead of doggedly believing in the inviolability of the city, the disciples are </p>
<p>to move out and move on in their task of witnessing. Indeed, the actions de-</p>
<p>scribed in vv. 15–16 are drastic. ey are not to return to the house, even to </p>
<p>grab a cloak (an important garment for self-preservation), but to ee. is is </p>
<p>because when the Romans come, they cannot count on God’s protection of </p>
<p>the Temple or the city. Indeed, the Romans may well be the agents God uses </p>
<p>to punish the nation for the abomination of desolation. As events panned </p>
<p>out, we can see the wisdom of this saying.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>All this goes against the grain of popular Jewish expectation. Since the </p>
<p>archetypal abomination of desolation caused the Maccabean revolt, which </p>
<p>resulted in victory for the Jewish cause, if a similar incident occurred Jews </p>
<p>would most likely take up arms and defend the holy place. e successful </p>
<p>98. Eusebius preserves a tradition that speaks of Christians eeing to the city of </p>
<p>Pella, before the war started, because of an oracle (H.E. 3:5:3). We are not sure whether </p>
<p>Eusebius has preserved an authentic tradition, and even if he has, the oracle might have </p>
<p>been something other than Mark 13:14. is is so because Pella is below sea level.</p>
