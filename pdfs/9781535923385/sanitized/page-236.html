<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>15:42–47218</p>
<p>The Burial of Jesus (15:42–47)</p>
<p>Since crucixion is designed to show the masses the terrible fate awaiting </p>
<p>anyone going against the Roman Empire, the burial of crucied victims is </p>
<p>not guaranteed. Indeed, they are oen le on the crosses to decompose, </p>
<p>producing a horrifying sight.</p>
<p>210</p>
<p>Special permission must be sought from</p>
<p>magistrates or governors for such burials. If this is granted, the corpses are </p>
<p>oen buried in mass graves unless someone inuential comes forward to </p>
claim the body and bury it in an individually assigned grave (Horace Epistu-
<p>lae 1:16, 18; cf. Tacitus Annals 6:29).</p>
<p>211</p>
<p>So this story in Mark is by no means</p>
<p>an anti-climax to the death of Jesus, because it relates that Jesus is properly </p>
<p>buried. Furthermore, it also introduces a character hitherto unmentioned. </p>
<p>is is Joseph of Arimathea, a member of the Sanhedrin.</p>
<p>Mark informs us in v. 42 that it is Preparation Day, and he explains this </p>
<p>as the day before the Sabbath. If corpses cannot be le unburied at nightfall </p>
<p>because of an OT injunction (Deut21:22–23), this is even more so if that </p>
<p>nightfall begins the Sabbath day. And if we were right that Jesus died on the </p>
<p>14th of Nisan, nightfall would begin the celebration of the Passover meal. </p>
<p>All this means Joseph of Arimathea has to take quick action to give Jesus an </p>
<p>honorable burial.</p>
<p>Who is this Joseph of Arimathea?e toponym is probably to be iden-</p>
<p>tied as Ramathaim-zophim (cf. 1 Sam 1:1), a town situated about twenty </p>
<p>miles northeast of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>212</p>
<p>More importantly,Mark informs us he is a </p>
<p>prominent member of the Sanhedrin who is also yearning for the kingdom </p>
<p>of God to come (v. 43). is implies he is a disciple of Jesus, since his mes-</p>
<p>sage concerns the kingdom. Conrmation of this is found in the description </p>
<p>that he goes to Pilate for permission to bury Jesus. A request from a promi-</p>
<p>nent member of the Sanhedrin is not a small matter. If that august body has </p>
<p>condemned Jesus to death, they will also have no wish for him to be given </p>
<p>an honorable burial. So Joseph’s request testies to his disagreement with </p>
<p>the Sanhedrin’s decision. Although Mark does not mention explicitly that </p>
<p>Joseph will use his own tomb for burying Jesus (cf. Matt 27:60), this may be </p>
<p>legitimately inferred.</p>
<p>Pilate expresses surprise that Jesus has died so quickly—most victims </p>
<p>would have lasted longer. Aer receiving conrmation from the centurion </p>
<p>who has supervised the crucixion, Pilate gives permission for Jesus’ body </p>
<p>to be given to Joseph. Verse 46 informs us that the necessary procedures </p>
<p>210. See the evidence assembled in Hengel 1977: 22–32.</p>
