<p>e Resurrection of Jesus 225</p>
<p>Jesus wants to re-gather his distraught and discouraged disciples, so </p>
<p>the women must not keep the story to themselves, but proclaim it to the dis-</p>
<p>ciples and Peter. e singling out of Peter implies there is restoration even </p>
<p>for Peter, the disciple who has failed so miserably. In addition, the women </p>
<p>are commissioned to inform the disciples that Jesus would be going ahead </p>
<p>of them into Galilee, repeating the promise of 14:28. It should also be noted </p>
<p>that “going ahead” here (the Greek used is proagō) has the same nuance </p>
<p>as that of 10:32 (i.e., it refers to Jesus’ leading them especially in critical </p>
<p>times). e word “there” is interesting. It may refer to a specic place such as </p>
<p>Galilee, or to the position of Jesus in relation to the disciples (i.e., he will be </p>
<p>leading them). Perhaps a double meaning is present, as the alternatives are </p>
<p>not mutually exclusive. e restoration of Jesus as the disciples’ shepherd is </p>
<p>thus emphasized and the Galilean setting indicates that the precious lessons </p>
<p>of discipleship will be taught once more. </p>
<p>e concluding phrase of v. 7 “just as he told you” is important, as it </p>
<p>speaks of the vindication of Jesus. All this has happened not as an accident </p>
<p>of history but has been foreseen by Jesus. is implies, of course, his contro-</p>
<p>versial teaching about his messianic role has proven to be correct. His word </p>
<p>may then be trusted.</p>
<p>Verse 8 informs us that the women are bewildered and ee from the </p>
<p>tomb with fear, qualities unbecoming of Jesus’ disciples. While outshining </p>
<p>the male disciples, they are not immaculate. We have argued earlier that the </p>
<p>putative ending would have described the women’s overcoming their fear </p>
<p>probably because Jesus appears to them, and with renewed courage they </p>
<p>inform the other disciples of the good news of Jesus’ resurrection. e his-</p>
<p>torical datum that women were the rst messengers of Jesus’ resurrection</p>
<p>229</p>
<p> </p>
<p>would not be something that Mark would want to contradict.</p>
