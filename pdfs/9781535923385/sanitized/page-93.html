<p>Mission Furthered and Martyrdom Foreshadowed 75</p>
<p>is remedied now, but in a way that gives it an ominous ring: Jesus’ fate is </p>
<p>expected to be quite similar to John’s.</p>
<p>e Twelve Sent (6:6b–13)</p>
<p>e Twelve are sent out in pairs (v. 7), probably in line with the tradition </p>
<p>that two witnesses are needed to validate a testimony (cf. Deut 17:6). ere </p>
<p>may also be a practical reason: a companion provides encouragement and </p>
<p>support (cf. Eccl 4:9–12). Not surprisingly, it was a Jewish custom to send </p>
<p>ocial representatives in pairs (b. Sanh. 26a, 43a). e Twelve may there-</p>
<p>fore be construed as the envoys of Jesus, bearing testimony to his word and </p>
<p>deed. In relation to this, the task of exorcism is emphasized (v. 7). We have </p>
<p>seen how this activity characterizes Jesus’ ministry as that which inducts the </p>
<p>kingdom. Verses 12–13 show that this activity has correlates: exorcism takes </p>
<p>place alongside kingdom preaching and healing.</p>
<p>e instructions given to the Twelve are ascetically stringent, and the </p>
<p>emphasis appears to be on mobility (i.e., theirs is a task that demands quick </p>
<p>travelling and not lengthy tarrying [vv. 8–11]). What is allowed—sta, san-</p>
<p>dals and tunic (but not an extra one)—serves mainly this function, although </p>
<p>self-preservation is also in view. So urgent is the task that the basic necessity </p>
<p>of food and shelter must be sought from those who would be hospitable to </p>
<p>them. Seen this way, the rationale for such stringent instructions becomes </p>
<p>transparent. ey are given in anticipation of a swi and hazardous mission.</p>
<p>For the unwelcoming or intransigent, the Twelve are to shake the dust </p>
<p>o their feet when they leave, as a symbolic gesture and testimony against </p>
<p>such people (v. 11). e rabbis were known to have shaken dust o their feet </p>
<p>upon leaving Gentile territory, to avoid carrying delement back to Israel or </p>
<p>their homes (m. ’Ohol. 2:3; m. Toh. 4:5). Probably a similar intention may be </p>
<p>posited of the action commanded by Jesus. eir action eectively means </p>
<p>that those who reject the message are regarded as deling outsiders to the </p>
<p>kingdom of God.</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>In this regard, the action serves also as a testimony</p>
<p>against them (cf. Acts 13:51; 18:6).</p>
<p>Much of what the Twelve do in their mission (v. 13) has a parallel </p>
<p>in Jesus’ ministry. ere is proclamation of repentance (cf. 1:15), exor-</p>
<p>cism, and healing (cf. 1:32). e anointing of the sick is new. Anointing is </p>
<p>oen performed with olive oil, which is believed to have medicinal quali-</p>
<p>ties. It probably symbolizes God’s presence—and in this instance, healing </p>
<p>presence—and special care.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>127. SB 1.571.</p>
<p>128. ere is no evidence that Jesus performed anointing to heal but it is a practice </p>
