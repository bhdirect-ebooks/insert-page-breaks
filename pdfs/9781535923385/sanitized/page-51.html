<p>Conict with Religious Authorities 33</p>
<p>ere also appears to be an intensication of hostility as the stories progress, </p>
climaxing in the plot to put Jesus to death by widely-divergent groups.
<p>Healing of the Paralytic 2:1–12</p>
<p>is rst conict story may be regarded as setting the tone for the other </p>
<p>conict stories. e main issue between Jesus and the religious authorities </p>
<p>revolves around his claims, which they think threatened their inherited tra-</p>
<p>ditions. In some ways, the story also foreshadows the nal conict with the </p>
<p>religious authorities in Jerusalem. In the passage about the Jewish hearing </p>
<p>of Jesus (14:55–65), the twin themes of blasphemy and the Son of Man are </p>
<p>found (14:62, 64), just as they are in this episode. Notably, Jesus refers to </p>
<p>himself as the “Son of Man” for the rst time. is is Jesus’ preferred way of </p>
<p>referring to himself, and carries important christological freight.</p>
<p>Capernaum is the setting. Depending on how the Greek phrase en oikō </p>
<p>(v. 1) is construed, it may refer either to Jesus’ home</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>(so NRSV) or Peter’s</p>
<p>house (cf. 1:29).</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>As usual, a crowd gathers. Roofs of houses in rst-century</p>
<p>Galilee might be reached easily by the wooden ladder outside.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Since they</p>
<p>were thatched and made of mud, they could be dug through easily. Such an </p>
<p>inconsiderate act would usually have led to angry reprisals, but Mark does </p>
<p>not tell us the reaction of the crowd or the owner of the house because his </p>
<p>focus is elsewhere. We may assume that the paralytic was participatory in </p>
<p>the initiative to seek Jesus. Hence, Mark tells us that Jesus sees their (i.e., the </p>
<p>whole group) faith, but speaks to the paralytic (v. 5).</p>
<p>Jesus’ response in v. 5 appears somewhat inappropriate, but it becomes </p>
<p>comprehensible when we bear in mind the biblical assumptions that (i) </p>
<p>the greater problem bedeviling humanity is their estrangement from God </p>
<p>(i.e., sin); and (ii) sin and sickness may be related. e latter is amply at-</p>
<p>tested in the literature of the ancient world and the OT (e.g., Deut 28:27; </p>
<p>Ps 107:17–18). A rabbinic saying runs: “A sick person does not arise from </p>
<p>his sickness until all his sins are forgiven him” (b. Ned. 41a). Hence, healing </p>
<p>and forgiveness oen intersect (e.g., Ps 41:3–4; 103:3; Isa 38:17; 53:4–6).</p>

<p> </p>
<p>However, this is not always the case (cf. John 9:2–3), as there may be other </p>
<p>factors at work.</p>
<p>Jesus’ speech caught the attention of the scribes. ese were people </p>
<p>of letters, as the Greek grammateus makes clear. However, in the Jewish </p>
