<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>8:10–21106</p>
<p>the presence of the kingdom, Jesus will have to reply that such a sign will not </p>
<p>be given, because it is antithetical to all that he has taught about the king-</p>
<p>dom. As we shall see later, it is not about triumphalism but humble service. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Jesus’ reply is in the form of an asseveration.</p>
<p>At its deepest core, the demand for a sign by the Pharisees stems from </p>
<p>a dierent vision of the kingdom. So the point is not that it is wrong to ask </p>
<p>for signs, for Scripture allows this and sometimes endorses it (see especially </p>
<p>Judg 6:36–40; 1 Kings 18:24, 36–38; and especially Isa 7:13–14). Instead, </p>
<p>the dispute is over kingdom-visions and kingdom-realities. If the signs per-</p>
<p>formed by Jesus do not convince, it must mean these people are imbibing a </p>
<p>dierent kingdom-vision. So it is not surprising that Mark tells us Jesus took </p>
<p>leave of the Pharisees aer their short dialogue, and crossed the lake to the </p>
<p>other side (i.e., away from Galilee and into Gentile territory yet again). And </p>
<p>it becomes clear why, on the way to the other side, Jesus warns his disciples </p>
<p>of the yeast of the Pharisees and of Herod.</p>
<p>e Warning to the Disciples (8:14–21)</p>
<p>Once the basic issue in the demand for the sign is uncovered, we are in a </p>
<p>position to understand the meaning of this episode—one which has baed </p>
<p>many commentators and led to many scathing remarks about Mark’s com-</p>
<p>positional technique.</p>
<p>190</p>
<p>e feeding of the 4,000 prompts the demand for</p>
<p>a sign from the Pharisees. e Pharisees oer an alternative vision of the </p>
<p>kingdom, a vision described by Jesus as yeast (i.e., the element that corrupts </p>
<p>the unleavened bread of the true kingdom vision). It is against this that the </p>
<p>disciples are warned. Herod is mentioned here because his vision of the </p>
<p>kingdom is also antithetical to that of Jesus. With this serving as introduc-</p>
<p>tion, the story will now be discussed in detail.</p>
<p>e story begins with the mention that the disciples have forgotten </p>
<p>to bring bread with them, except for one loaf (v. 14). Just the mention of </p>
<p>the “one loaf” has prompted scholars to consider whether there is a deeper </p>
<p>meaning to it. Moreover, the Markan syntax is peculiar in that it appears </p>
<p>to be in two minds. Translated literally, v. 14 says: “And they forgot to take </p>
<p>breads (the Greek is plural)—and they had no bread except for one—with </p>
<p>them in the boat.” Hence, it has been suggested that the one loaf refers either </p>
<p>to Jesus (the bread of life)</p>
<p>191</p>
<p>or the Eucharistic bread (the one loaf of the</p>
<p>church).</p>
<p>192</p>
<p>Approached this way, Mark is then commenting either on the</p>
<p>190. Cf. Beavis 1989: 105–14.</p>
<p>191. Hooker 1991: 192.</p>
<p>192. Marcus 2000: 509–10. Cf. Quesnell 1969: 231–32, 242–43.</p>
