<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>13:1–37172</p>
<p>e rst is that Mark presents all the prominent groupings of rst-</p>
<p>century Judaism as being arrayed against Jesus. He does this nowhere else </p>
<p>except in this collection of conict stories. He introduces new groups in </p>
<p>debate with Jesus, such as the chief priests, the elders and the Sadducees, </p>
<p>groups hitherto unmentioned as interlocutors. But previously mentioned </p>
<p>groups are also featured: the Pharisees and Herodians.</p>
<p>Secondly, the content of the debates shows Jesus is less reluctant to </p>
<p>hide his messianic status. Jesus discusses with his interlocutors the special </p>
<p>identity of the Son of David, and also implicitly refers to himself as the son </p>
<p>of the owner of the vineyard of Israel. Furthermore, Mark informs us that </p>
<p>the one parable Jesus tells in Jerusalem is no longer mystifying but is grasped </p>
<p>by outsiders. All this contrasts with the secrecy orders of chapters 1–10. We </p>
<p>get the impression that Mark’s Jesus views his ministry in Jerusalem as the </p>
<p>climax, in which issues are urgent and the need to conceal his identity is no </p>
<p>longer appropriate.</p>
<p>All this takes place in the city of God, where promises of his return </p>
<p>to reign as king are intimately bound. Jesus must therefore confront the </p>
<p>city and her leaders with the gospel of God’s return to Zion (cf. Isa 52:7). </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, critical issues relating to Jesus’ identity (the question </p>
<p>about Jesus’ authority, the parable of the talents, the question about David’s </p>
<p>son), covenantal identity (the question about the greatest commandment), </p>
<p>Israel’s relation to the powers that be (the question about paying taxes to </p>
<p>Caesar), and the eschaton (the Sadducean question about the resurrection) </p>
<p>are featured.</p>
<p>The Eschatological Discourse ontheMountofOlives </p>
<p>(13:1–37)</p>
<p>is discourse of Jesus in Mark 13 has baed many readers, leading to a </p>
great diversity of opinions and views being oered. Nevertheless, it is right
<p>to assume that the discourse is given in order to be understood. Perhaps </p>
<p>what oen prevents us from understanding it is the failure to consider the </p>
<p>context or our making it answer questions it is not designed for. We cannot </p>
<p>hope to interact with all the scholarly views available but we will simply </p>
<p>explicate the view that is adopted and, at the same time, oer a sort of a map </p>
<p>through the maze of the discourse. </p>
<p>e discourse is chiey concerned with events connected with the de-</p>
<p>struction of the Temple because, aer all, it is the context of the discourse. </p>
<p>However, the destruction of the Temple is linked with the vindication of the </p>
