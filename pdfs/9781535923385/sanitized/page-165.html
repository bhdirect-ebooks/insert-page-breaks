<p>Restoring Bartimaeus’ Sight 147</p>
<p>connects this title with mercy. In Jewish thought the Son of David is usually </p>
<p>regarded as a warlike gure who will deliver the nation from her enemies. </p>
<p>Can it be that Bartimaeus is able to transcend the usual understanding of </p>
<p>messianic function to grasp a neglected but important aspect of it? Note </p>
<p>that the compassion of Jesus is the chief feature in the two feeding stories </p>
<p>(6:34–44; 8:1–9).</p>
<p>Excursus: The Son of David</p>
<p>The Prophets never lost hope for the restoration of the Davidic rule, even in </p>
<p>the face of destruction and deportation. The belief in a scion or branch of </p>
<p>David, to be raised up by God at the end of days, is thus frequently found </p>
<p>(Isa 11:1; Jer 23:5; 33:5; Zech 3:8; 6:12). This person is expected to </p>
<p>rule as the vicegerent of God, in fulﬁllment of the covenant God made with </p>
<p>David in 2 Sam 7:11–16. Later Jewish thought focuses on the militaristic </p>
<p>aspect of this coming ﬁgure, who is also called the “Son of David” (Pss Sol </p>
<p>17–18).</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>Jesus’ connection to David is not mentioned prior to this passage</p>
<p>in Mark’s Gospel. The title of “Messiah” may imply that he is from the line </p>
<p>of David, but even this is not ﬁrm, as the term has also been used to depict </p>
<p>a coming priest who would restore true worship in the Temple of Jerusalem. </p>
<p>This as attested in the Qumran community (1QS 9:10–11).</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>Although rebuked to be silent, Bartimaeus persists. e one on a resolute </p>
<p>march to Jerusalem stops and asks for Bartimaeus to be brought to him. </p>
<p>Mark provides the signicant information that Bartimaeus throws away his </p>
<p>cloak before jumping to his feet and coming to Jesus (v. 50). is is signi-</p>
<p>cant in a number of ways. First, according to the Torah a person’s cloak can-</p>
<p>not be taken away from him by any creditor, as it is deemed essential to his </p>
<p>existence (Exod 22:26–27; Deut 24:12–13). For a blind beggar in the setting </p>
<p>of rst century Palestine, the cloak takes on an even greater signicance, as </p>
<p>it represents all his worldly goods and the one means of obtaining suste-</p>
<p>nance for himself (i.e., the cloak is used for begging).</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>Hence, Bartimaeus</p>

<p>in Charlesworth 1992; and Neusner, Green and Frerichs 1987. However, the case for </p>
diversity has oen been overstated. See Collins 1995; and Horbury 1998.
