<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>1:16–4524</p>
<p>with the kingdom of God should not be missed. In the prophetic literature, </p>
<p>repentance (oen described with the Hebrew šûb) is oen the precondition </p>
<p>of forgiveness and restoration (Isa 44:22; Jer 3:10–14; Hos 14:1–9). All this </p>
<p>is oen couched in corporate terms.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> In this regard, the pattern of sin-exile-</p>
<p>restoration, found frequently in the story of Israel and God, may plausibly </p>
<p>be latent here.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>More signicantly, there can be no repentance if we do not</p>
<p>agree with God’s statement of our condition or his promise of forgiveness. </p>
<p>Hence, repentance and faith are two sides of the same coin: we repent be-</p>
<p>lievingly, and we believe repentantly. Note the link back to John’s ministry, </p>
<p>as his baptism is a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins (1:4).</p>
<p>Leading from the above point is the idea that this faith, while directed </p>
<p>ultimately to God, must also take the form of believing the message of Jesus. </p>
<p>As Mark will demonstrate later, faith is not so much about trusting generally </p>
<p>in God’s faithfulness as confessing that through the ministry of Jesus God’s </p>
<p>faithfulness is seen. In this regard, the promises that Israel longed for are </p>
<p>now encapsulated in the ministry of Jesus.</p>
<p>The Gospel in Action and Typical Activities of Jesus’ </p>
<p>Ministry (1:16–45)</p>
<p>In this section the typical activities of Jesus’ ministry are presented in cameo </p>
<p>form. Mark narrates Jesus’ call of his rst disciples (1:16–20), his teaching </p>
<p>activity which is connected with the performance of miracles (1:21–39), and </p>
<p>the foreshadowing of conict through the story of the healing of the leper </p>
<p>(1:40–45). Discipleship, teaching, miracles, and conict will be motifs oc-</p>
<p>cupying much of Mark’s Gospel. rough all these cameo-like stories, Mark </p>
<p>gives his listeners an idea of what it means for the gospel to be in action.</p>
<p>e Call of the First Disciples (1:16–20)</p>
<p>If according to the prophetic literature, God’s return to Zion takes place in </p>
<p>tandem with the reconstituting of a covenantal community (Isa 59:20–21; </p>
<p>61:1–8; Jer 31:31–34; Ezek 37:21–28; Hos 2:18–23), and if, through the </p>
<p>Spirit’s anointing, the task of this reconstitution has been devolved upon </p>
<p>Jesus, then it is not surprising that together with the gospel proclamation, </p>
<p>Jesus would call disciples as the rst step in building this reconstituted com-</p>
<p>munity. is is precisely what is presented in vv. 16–20.</p>
