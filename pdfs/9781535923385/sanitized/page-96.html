<p>will therefore be treated in an excursus. Suce it here to say that Mark’s </p>
<p>account is historically credible and is craed adroitly to hold the audience’s </p>
<p>interest. e story makes a moral point in the setting of wantonness, lust </p>
<p>and a macabre execution.</p>
<p>Excursus: Mark and Josephus on John the Baptist</p>
<p>Josephus records that the main reason for John’s arrest was Antipas’s fear </p>
<p>of a possible uprising (Antiquities 18:118). This may be construed as a </p>
<p>political reason. Mark seems to suggest a moral reason instead. But the </p>
<p>two may be harmonized without great difﬁculty, since in Jewish culture </p>
<p>there is no dichotomy between public ofﬁce and private life, and morality </p>
<p>is seen to be an inseparable component of politics. This is even more so </p>
<p>if the ruler is deemed an outsider. So it is eminently possible that John’s </p>
<p>criticism of Antipas’s marriage, illegitimate from the standpoint of Jewish </p>
<p>morality, might provide the tinder for an already tense situation to become </p>
<p>explosive, especially when the Herods’s rule was unwelcome by most Jews. </p>
<p>Indeed, Antipas’s marriage to Herodias did lead to tension between him and </p>
<p>Aretas IV, the king of the Nabateans and the father of the wife whom Antipas </p>
divorced. Antipas would not want internal problems to surface, as he was
<p>already facing an external foe. John’s criticism of the marriage by using a </p>
<p>moral principle strongly held by the Jews could do just that. Hence, Antipas </p>
<p>believed some sort of preemptive action would be in order.</p>
<p>Josephus also mentions that John’s incarceration was at Machaerus in </p>
<p>Peraea, where he would also be executed (Antiquities 18:119). This datum </p>
<p>is quite peculiar, as Josephus informs us just a few lines before that this was </p>
<p>under the control of Aretas IV (Antiquities 18:112). Why would a purport-</p>
<p>edly seditious element be placed by Antipas, and a birthday banquet held, </p>
<p>at a stronghold that belonged to someone (Aretas IV) who was having a quar-</p>
<p>rel with him? Mark’s location appears to be more logical, as v. 21 suggests </p>
<p>that the banquet was held in Galilee. However, this is an inference that is </p>
<p>drawn from the presence of Galilean noblemen (v. 21), as Mark does not </p>
<p>state explicitly where the banquet was held. Given such uncertainties over </p>
<p>the data, it would be premature to speak of Mark’s unreliability.</p>
<p>Finally, there appears to be confusion over the name of Herodias’s </p>
<p>husband. Mark calls him Philip, while Josephus calls him Herod, and never </p>
<p>Philip (Antiquities 18:109). Interestingly, Mark never mentions Philip the </p>
