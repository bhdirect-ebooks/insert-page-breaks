<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>6:31–5684</p>
<p>for military purposes.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>If this is the case, an Exodus typology may also be</p>
<p>said to be at work.</p>
<p>Although some commentators have regarded the actions described in </p>
<p>v. 41 as alluding to the Eucharist, it must equally be said that this was the </p>
<p>typical action of the head of a Jewish household during meals.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>e municence of the miracle</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>is being emphasized in v. 42. Not</p>
<p>only are the people fed, they are also “lled to the brim,” as the Greek word </p>
<p>chortazomai indicates. Furthermore, the disciples picked up twelve basket-</p>
<p>fuls of broken pieces. e word for “basket” here is the Greek kophinos, and </p>
<p>it refers to a distinctively Jewish receptacle.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the numbers in the story are also symbolical. </p>
<p>It is highly plausible that the number ve alludes to the Torah. Moreover, </p>
<p>Jews sometimes compare the Torah with bread.</p>
<p>150</p>
<p>e number twelve may</p>
<p>be symbolic of the twelve tribes of Israel, and the underlying theological </p>
<p>message is that these twelve tribes are reconstituted through the work of the </p>
<p>eschatological shepherd.</p>
<p>It may be instructive to mention here that some scholars have detected </p>
<p>echoes of the exploits of the prophets Elijah and Elisha in this episode (1 </p>
<p>Kings 17:8–16; 2 Kings 4:42–44).</p>
<p>151</p>
<p>While this cannot be totally ruled out,</p>
<p>it is important to emphasize the dissimilarities. A large crowd is fed in this </p>
<p>episode and not just one widow. Furthermore, the description of the crowd </p>
<p>as sheep without shepherd suggests a dierent connection. Indeed, the next </p>
<p>episode of Jesus’ walking on the water, which is connected with this feeding </p>
<p>miracle, shows that the prophetic connection, if it is present at all, is at best </p>
<p>secondary.</p>
<p>We may now sum up the signicance of the miracle as a whole.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>datum provided by 6:4 is critical. As explained above, this is an image recall-</p>
<p>ing Israel bere of godly leadership, with the hope that God would one day </p>
<p>146. Collins 2007: 324–26; Marcus 2000: 419.</p>
<p>147. Jeremias 1966a: 108–9.</p>
<p>148. Feeding miracles are known in Judaism, but not on such a scale. In b. Ta‘an. </p>
<p>24b-25a some bread is said to have appeared miraculously in Hanina ben Dosa’s empty </p>
<p>oven.</p>
<p>149. Juvenal 3:14; 6:54; see BDAG for description. We are not sure of its actual size.</p>
<p>150. Cf. Borgen 1965: 104; Marcus 2000: 407.</p>
<p>151. Collins 2007: 319–20.</p>
<p>152. It has been suggested that no miracle actually took place (Myers). Instead, what </p>
<p>happened was that the miserly hearts of the crowd were stricken by a boy’s contribution </p>
<p>(cf. John 6:9), and everyone took out food he had surreptitiously hidden to share with </p>
<p>those seating next to him. is is unscholarly in the extreme, as this theory aims not to </p>
<p>exegete what Mark’s narrative means, but to defend a naturalistic worldview. Clearly, </p>
<p>Mark intends his audience to understand a miracle has taken place.</p>
