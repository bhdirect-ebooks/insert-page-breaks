<p>A Sketch of Mark’s eology</p>
<p>228</p>
<p>Jesus as meaning primarily the latter. Hence, the self-designation dovetails </p>
<p>with the very important kingdom theme, since the Son of Man in Daniel </p>
<p>is a gure used to depict the irruption of God’s kingdom. at said, Jesus </p>
<p>redenes this role by juxtaposing it with the Suering Servant of Isaiah. is </p>
<p>means the Son of Man who is expected to bring in God’s kingdom must also </p>
<p>suer in the process. It must be stressed that this suering is to be linked to </p>
<p>service and redemption (10:45).</p>
<p>e above provides a framework for understanding the secrecy theme, </p>
<p>which is prominent in Mark. Jesus is oen portrayed as adjuring silence </p>
<p>about his true identity, when this is precisely what he hopes to demonstrate </p>
<p>through spectacular deeds. To cite just an example: why should Jesus com-</p>
<p>mand silence over the raising of Jairus’s daughter from death (5:43), when he </p>
<p>has been teasing the crowd into active thought about his identity (5:35–36)? </p>
<p>Since the seminal work of Wilhelm Wrede, this phenomenon is given the </p>
<p>name of “messianic secret.”</p>

<p>e scope of this commentary does not allow for protracted discus-</p>
<p>sion of the dierent scholarly explications of this theme,</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> but we will sim-</p>
<p>ply explain our position. At one level it may be possible to explain Jesus’ </p>
<p>command of silence as stemming from prudence, as he wanted to avoid </p>
<p>being identied with bellicose ideas of messiahship.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Much speculation on</p>
<p>the role of the Messiah at that time focused on his liberation of the nation </p>
<p>from political foes (Pss Sol 17; 1QSb 5:20–29). Without a proper theological </p>
<p>framework for understanding this, the claim to be the Messiah might incite </p>
<p>an armed revolution.</p>
<p>At another level, this secrecy theme dovetails with Jesus’ teaching of </p>
<p>the time of the kingdom’s coming. It comes secretly now and in a hidden </p>
<p>form; only the eyes of faith can perceive it. However, it will be manifested </p>
<p>gloriously one day, at the consummation of history. e same is true of Jesus. </p>
<p>His true status remained hidden but would be revealed one day. e theme </p>
<p>also captures much of what Jesus taught about the nature of the kingdom. </p>
<p>Profoundly covenantal in nature (14:24–25), it involved the death of the </p>
<p>Messiah. Indeed, the confession of the Roman centurion serves to highlight </p>
<p>this in Mark’s plot (15:39). It is when Jesus is crucied that the authentic </p>

<p>some scholarly circles, it is still useful for describing Mark’s Christology. See recently </p>

<p>11. For starters, see the collection of essays in Tuckett 1983. Cf. the recent attempts </p>
<p>to resolve this by resurrecting the concept of Messiah-designate, to be enthroned in the </p>
