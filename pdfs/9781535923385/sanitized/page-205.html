<p>Corinthians.) Moreover, Jesus now speaks of a particular day (singular) </p>
<p>when throughout the discourse he has spoken of days in the plural. Biblical </p>
<p>literature is notorious for the ambiguous use of the singular and the plural. </p>
<p>Hence, we must not set too much store by it. Nevertheless, we may also note </p>
<p>the parallel found in Matthew, which understands Mark as pointing to a </p>
<p>dierent event, especially when he uses the Greek word parousia to describe </p>
<p>it (Matt 24:37–39).</p>
<p>e upshot of all this is that Jesus speaks of the “unknowability” of the </p>
<p>time of his second coming. Such knowledge belongs only to the Father, as he </p>
<p>is the one who determines when it is to take place. What all this means for </p>
<p>the disciples is that they will know the time frame for the Temple’s destruc-</p>
<p>tion. ey will know that Jesus’ Parousia cannot take place until aer that; </p>
<p>but they won’t know the length of the interval between the Temple’s destruc-</p>
<p>tion and the Parousia. Notwithstanding, they are still to be vigilant at all </p>
<p>times. e key word in the discourse, blepō (“see”) is now accompanied by </p>
<p>agrypneō (“do not sleep” or “keep watch”), heightening the call for vigilance </p>
<p>(v. 33). is heightening points to the profound signicance of the subject </p>
<p>matter, which is the Parousia.</p>
<p>Just as a comparison was made in the earlier paragraph, a comparison </p>
<p>is also made now to teach about the time of the Parousia. In this comparison </p>
<p>the absentee landlord is used. is man assigns responsibilities to his ser-</p>
<p>vants while he is away, even assigning someone to keep watch at the door. </p>
<p>ere is no indication when he is coming back, and so his servants must al-</p>
<p>ways be on the alert. e comparison is apt, as it alludes to Jesus’ going away </p>
<p>and his assigning of duties to his servants. His absence must not be taken </p>
<p>as an opportunity for sloth or complacency, but for faithful discharging of </p>
<p>responsibilities assigned. So the servants must be “alert” (v. 35).</p>
<p>e discourse ends by universalizing the exhortation to watch (v. 37). </p>
<p>When it comes to portents of the destruction of the Temple and rumors of </p>
<p>the end, the disciples must be discerning. But when it comes to the Parousia, </p>
<p>they are to keep vigil, and discharge faithfully the responsibilities given to </p>
<p>them. So at the end of the discourse the discipleship thrust becomes clear </p>
<p>again.</p>

<p>From this point on, Mark’s Gospel slows down dramatically as the key mo-</p>
<p>ment approaches. Indeed, one scholar has even provocatively called Mark’s </p>
<p>Gospel a passion narrative with a long introduction.</p>
