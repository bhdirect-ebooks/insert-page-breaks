<p>Nor does it come to make</p>
<p>everything clear, and at a stroke deliver Israel from her enemies and consign </p>
<p>them to everlasting punishment. No, the kingdom begins in a hidden way, </p>
<p>like seed that is planted. But this seed will inexorably develop into that giant </p>
<p>tree that Jews expect. So the kingdom does come but not in the way that is </p>
<p>expected.</p>
<p>Summary (4:33–34)</p>
<p>Mark summarizes this section by reiterating the main themes (vv. 33–34). </p>
<p>He starts by stating that many similar parables were spoken by Jesus. is </p>
<p>dovetails with the hermeneutical emphasis of this section: the Parable of </p>
<p>the Sower is the parable that unlocks others. It also states that Jesus’ char-</p>
<p>acteristic teaching method uses parables. Furthermore, the insider-outsider </p>
<p>antithesis is reiterated: explanations are given only to those who are Jesus’ </p>
<p>disciples.</p>
<p>Stilling the Storm (4:35–41)</p>
<p>e statement that the lamp comes for the purpose of revelation and not </p>
<p>concealment (4:21) is developed further with this story. Jesus’ true identity </p>
<p>is revealed, as the winds and waves obey him, just as they obey God. e </p>
<p>story also initiates a series of miracle stories (four altogether), which culmi-</p>
<p>nates with the rejection of Jesus by his own townspeople, who are described </p>
<p>as people without faith (6:1–6). Indeed, the theme of faith—especially that </p>
<p>of the disciples—also receives signicant treatment from this story onwards.</p>
<p>e instruction to the disciples to cross the lake while Jesus himself re-</p>
<p>mained to dismiss the crowd sets the stage for the miracle story (vv. 35–36). </p>
<p>e reason for this is not given, unless we think of the next story in chapter </p>
<p>5 (i.e., the encounter with the Gerasene demoniac) as implicitly providing it.</p>
<p>It is peculiar that someone should be sound asleep in a small boat tossed </p>
<p>by a tempest and yet this is precisely what Jesus does (v. 38). Perhaps Mark </p>
<p>wants his audience to recall the OT concept of sleeping peacefully as a sign </p>
<p>of trusting in God (Ps 3:5; 4:8; Prov 3:24).</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>However, from the perspective</p>
<p>103. Concepts of the cosmic tree abound in ancient culture. Indeed, as Wyatt ob-</p>
<p>serves, “the tree is both an axis mundi . . . that is, the central pillar of the universe . . . </p>
<p>and an allomorph of the Primal Man,” (Wyatt 2001: 166). See also Collins 1993a: 223; </p>
<p>James 1966; and Widengren 1951.</p>
<p>104. Cope argues that a parallel to the story of Jonah is intended, but the case is </p>
<p>unconvincing (e.g., Jesus is not eeing from God’s call); see Cope 1976: 96–97 followed </p>
<p>by Collins 2007: 259–60; cf. Aus 2000. Highly suggestive is the idea that the depiction </p>
