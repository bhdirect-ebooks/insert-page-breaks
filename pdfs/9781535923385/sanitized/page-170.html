<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>11:1–26152</p>
<p>made clear by the next statement, which speaks of the blessed coming of the </p>
<p>kingdom of David (v. 10).</p>
<p>e upshot of all this is that the crowd, according to Mark’s narrative, </p>
<p>certainly acclaims Jesus to be the long-awaited Davidic king. All the actions </p>
<p>performed, and all the words uttered, take on this meaning. Signicantly, </p>
<p>Jesus does not silence them as he usually does in previous stories. In fact, his </p>
<p>action of riding an animal into Jerusalem serves to encourage it!</p>
<p>e end of all Jewish religious pilgrimages in rst century Palestine is </p>
<p>the Temple, and so Jesus enters the Temple and takes a look at everything </p>
<p>(v. 11). Since it is late, Jesus and the Twelve retire to Bethany, where Jesus’ </p>
<p>friends are. What may be of interest here is the description of Jesus looking </p>
<p>around. It heightens suspense (i.e., is that all Jesus will do aer the adulation </p>
<p>of the crowd?) and also sounds an ominous note: is Jesus doing some sort </p>
<p>of inspection visit? To unravel this, the Markan audience must listen to the </p>
<p>sequel. Here, we see good story-telling technique at work.</p>
<p>e Cursing of the Fig Tree (11:12–14)</p>
<p>e sequel to the Entry story, which takes place the day aer, comes in the </p>
<p>form of a narrative sandwich. e framing story is the cursing of the g </p>
<p>tree (vv. 12–14; 20–21), and the story that is framed is the action in the </p>
<p>Temple (vv. 15–19). e two stories are meant to be mutually illuminating </p>
<p>and interpretative.</p>
<p>e story of the cursing of the g tree has raised many questions for </p>
<p>Christians. at there is a deeper layer of meaning, Mark indicates through </p>
<p>two pieces of information. Mark begins the story by mentioning Jesus’ hun-</p>
<p>ger as he journeys from Bethany to Jerusalem (v. 12). is is peculiar since </p>
<p>Bethany is only two miles from Jerusalem. Is it because his host failed to </p>
<p>feed Jesus before the latter started the journey? is appears implausible. Or </p>
<p>did Jesus set o deliberately without food in order to set the stage to convey </p>
<p>some symbolic meaning? Mark does not tell us explicitly, but are there other </p>
<p>clues that point in this direction?</p>
<p>Secondly, Mark states explicitly that it is not the season for gs, and </p>
<p>that his disciples heard Jesus’ curse clearly (vv. 13–14).</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>e datum either</p>
<p>appears to make Jesus’ action more reprehensible, or it points to a deeper </p>
<p>meaning at work. e latter is to be preferred, as it is impossible to think </p>
<p>Mark would want to make Jesus appear in a bad light. Mark does not yet </p>
<p>tell us this deeper meaning, but the sandwich technique he uses hints at </p>
<p>9. is is the most cogent way of understanding the syntax. For discussion of the </p>
<p>dierent scholarly proposals, see Telford 1980: 26.</p>
