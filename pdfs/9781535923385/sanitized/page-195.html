<p>e Eschatological Discourse ontheMountofOlives 177</p>
<p>From the Mount of Olives, which oers a magnicent view of the </p>
<p>Temple and has eschatological signicance itself (Zech 14:1–4), Jesus’ dis-</p>
<p>ciples ask questions about his prophecy. eir questions may be understood </p>
<p>as referring to one event, although two aspects of it are being asked. e </p>
<p>rst is about the time, and the second, the sign. Interestingly, the event is </p>
<p>spoken of in the plural (“these things”), even though Jesus has spoken only </p>
<p>of the destruction of the Temple. e reason for this is that the Temple is not </p>
<p>simply a building of bricks and mortars. It also represents Jewish national </p>
<p>identity and God’s election.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>Consequently, the destruction of the Temple</p>
<p>cannot be a solo event without consequences. In this light, “these things” </p>
<p>may be appropriate, as they refer to all the tragic circumstances surrounding </p>
<p>the destruction of the Temple. One can understand why in the Matthean </p>
<p>version (Matt 24:3) the question is linked with the end of the age. Many </p>
<p>in Israel believe the period preceding the denouement will be full of woes </p>
<p>and tribulation.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>One event that qualies as the climax of such woes is the</p>
<p>destruction of the Temple. All this explains why the disciples ask for the sign </p>
<p>that will kick o “these things.” However, we will see that Jesus separates the </p>
<p>destruction of the Temple chronologically from the end of the age.</p>
<p>Rumors of the End (13:5–8)</p>
<p>e rst word in Jesus’ answer is “Watch” (v. 5). e Greek blepō, as used </p>
<p>here, means both discernment (seeing beyond appearances) and alertness </p>
<p>(being ready to take proper action). is word sets the tone for the whole </p>
<p>discourse, as we see from its repetition in vv. 9, 23 and 33. “To watch” is </p>
<p>related to something tangible. Hence, Jesus proceeds to speak about false </p>
<p>signs.</p>
<p>Speculations about the end will become rife as wars and rumors of </p>
<p>wars spread, and natural disasters such as earthquakes and famines occur. </p>
<p>ese events are oen associated with eschatological expectations in Jewish </p>
<p>thought (Isa 19:2; 4 Ezra 13:31; Mic 1:3–4; Hab 3:6–10; Zech 14:5; 2 Bar </p>
<p>27:2, 6; b. Ber. 55a). ere will even be people coming in Jesus’ name, or </p>
<p>claiming to be the person himself. Many will be deceived because distress </p>
<p>and ominous events make them vulnerable to the persuasions of messianic </p>
<p>claimants. Against such runaway speculation, Jesus warns the end has not </p>
<p>yet come. It is hard to take the word “end” in v. 7 as referring merely to </p>
<p>the destruction of the Temple (i.e., to translate “end” as “completing the </p>
