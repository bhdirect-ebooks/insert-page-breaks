<p>of Jesus and his disciples to the lake, and this is appropriate as a response </p>
<p>to the controversial atmosphere of the previous cycle of stories (2:1—3:6). </p>
<p>Not only this, a large crowd follows Jesus, indicating his rising popularity, </p>
<p>and perhaps serving as a contrasting picture to the response of the religious </p>
<p>authorities. Some in the crowd come from faraway places such as Tyre and </p>
<p>Sidon, perhaps preparing the reader for the story of 7:24–30. So great is this </p>
<p>crowd that Jesus has to use a boat to prevent the people from crowding him. </p>
<p>With this description, Mark introduces a new vehicle of Jesus’ ministry (v. </p>
<p>9). He would frequently be in a boat, teaching large crowds gathered at the </p>
<p>shore of the Sea of Galilee, and moving across that lake with the same boat. </p>
<p>Indeed, Mark will later narrate interesting incidents involving this boat </p>
<p>(4:35–39; 6:45–52).</p>
<p>Jesus’ encounters with unclean spirits continue, with a recurrent pat-</p>
<p>tern: these spirits know the true identity of Jesus but they are commanded </p>
<p>to be silent. But this time round, the confession made by the unclean spirits </p>
<p>is that Jesus is the Son of God (v. 11). Up to this stage, we see that apart </p>
from God’s declaration of Jesus’ divine sonship, no other being on earth has
<p>acclaimed Jesus to be such, except those possessed by unclean spirits.</p>
<p>The New People of God and Jesus’ True Family (3:13–45)</p>
<p>e material here covers three stories. e rst is the appointment of the </p>
<p>twelve apostles (3:13–19). e second and third stories strike a dierent </p>
<p>note, as they feature opposition to Jesus. ese two stories are integral to </p>
<p>each other because one is sandwiched by the other—a story is told partially </p>
<p>(3:20–21) before moving on to the next (3:22–30), and then back again to </p>
<p>complete it (3:31–35). e opposition depicted comes from Jesus’ family </p>
<p>and the scribes. Both groups regard Jesus as “beyond the pale” (mad or </p>
<p>demon-possessed). Together the three stories clarify the true members of </p>
<p>Jesus’ family.</p>
<p>Making of the Twelve (3:13–19)</p>
<p>e Greek phrase apēlthon pros auton (v. 13) means literally “they departed </p>
<p>to him” (i.e., the disciples le a larger parent group to join Jesus). Hence-</p>
<p>forth, they form a group of specially chosen people, dierentiated from the </p>
<p>crowds.</p>
<p>To say that Jesus appointed the Twelve does not quite capture the </p>
<p>Markan idea (vv. 14–15). e Greek verb used is epoiēsen, and it is best </p>
