<p>Challenge in Jerusalem: SymbolsofFulllmentandJudgment 151</p>
<p>If Jesus is consciously performing something provocative, we should </p>
<p>expect him to explain what this is. But he does not, and this strange silence </p>
<p>is found also in all the parallel accounts in the other three Gospels. Unless </p>
<p>we think there is a total failure of communication, we must believe there is </p>
<p>something in the traditions of Israel that can clarify Jesus’ intention. En-</p>
<p>tries into Jerusalem on animals are mentioned twice in the OT: once for the </p>
<p>coronation of Solomon (1 Kings 1:33), and the other in a prophecy of the </p>
<p>eschatological Davidic king, who comes riding into Jerusalem to usher in </p>
<p>what the city stands for: peace (Zech 9:9). is verse is not quoted in Mark, </p>
<p>although we nd it being used in the Matthean and the Johannine accounts </p>
<p>(Matt 21:5; John 12:15). It is this royal background we propose is lurking </p>
<p>behind Jesus’ action. His riding into Jerusalem on an animal signies that </p>
<p>this long-expected prophecy is now coming to pass. Jerusalem is now con-</p>
<p>fronted with the long-awaited king.</p>
<p>In this respect, the crowd strewing clothes on the road is meant to </p>
<p>signify their acceptance of him as their ruler. is is certainly not done for </p>
<p>the convenience of any traveler but is performed as a sign of honor and al-</p>
<p>legiance (cf. 2 Kings 9:13). e leafy branches that were cut from the elds </p>
<p>and strewn on the road serve the same purpose: they provide a sort of car-</p>
<p>peting for the one honored to tread on.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>What is most signicant is the adulation of the crowd. e rst impor-</p>
<p>tant term in the adulation to note is “hosanna.” is liturgical term comes </p>
<p>from the Hebrew hôšî‘â-nā’ of Ps 118:25–26, one of the psalms chanted by </p>
<p>pilgrims as they ascend Jerusalem during religious festivals.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> Its basic mean-</p>
<p>ing is “save us now,” and was originally a cry for deliverance. e LXX trans-</p>
<p>lates the term as sōson (i.e., “save,” thereby demonstrating that this basic </p>
<p>sense is to be retained). at said, the strange use of hosanna in Mark 11:10 </p>
<p>(“hosanna in the highest”) may indicate that, in the course of its liturgi-</p>
<p>cal usage, the term may not always have strong connections to its original </p>
<p>meaning. Hence, it may be used as a general term for praise.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>In the OT such</p>
<p>an acclamation is given either to God or the king (2 Sam 14:4; 2 Kings 6:26). </p>
<p>Mark tells us that this hosanna is oered to Jesus, suggesting that he is to be </p>
<p>identied with this Davidic tradition.</p>
<p>e phrase “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord” is oen </p>
<p>used to greet pilgrims arriving in the Temple. is may be the case here, </p>
<p>but the greeting to be extended to the Messiah when he nally comes to the </p>
<p>Temple may also take this form (cf. Matt 23:39||Luke 13:15). e latter is </p>
