<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>14:53–72202</p>
<p>The Hearing by the Sanhedrin (14:53–72)</p>
<p>Studies on the trial narrative are oen bedeviled by historical problems. </p>
<p>Two questions that recur concern the charge made against Jesus and the </p>
<p>legality of the trial.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p>Does what Mark narrates appear credible when set</p>
<p>against what we know of Jewish religion and Roman administration of </p>
<p>the rst century? e question about the charge will be addressed in the </p>
<p>course of the commentary; the question about the legality of the trial may </p>
<p>be treated at the outset.</p>
<p>According to the Mishnah, it is stipulated that trials relating to capital </p>
<p>punishment must be conducted in the day, and certainly not held on the eve </p>
<p>of a festival. Moreover, it must be held in the specied courtrooms, and any </p>
<p>verdict to be given must not be made on the same day. is is to prevent </p>
<p>any miscarriage of justice due to haste. e trial in Mark breaks these rules, </p>
<p>and therefore raises doubts over whether his account is credible. Two things </p>
<p>need to be said in reply. First, the regulations in the Mishnah were codied </p>
<p>at the end of the second century. How many of these were being practiced </p>
<p>in the rst century remains uncertain.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p>Secondly, there is no indication in</p>
<p>Mark that this was a formal trial. In fact, it has all the appearances of an out-</p>
<p>of-court hearing to decide whether the matter should be handed over to the </p>
<p>Roman authorities.</p>
<p>163</p>
<p>On both counts it may legitimately be concluded that</p>
<p>the Mishnaic regulations may not be as relevant as they are oen thought.</p>
<p>In fact, Mark’s account is historically plausible. We have already been </p>
<p>informed the Temple establishment has a great interest in seeing Jesus’ </p>
<p>condemned. As the administration of capital punishment has been taken </p>
<p>away from the Jewish authorities by the Romans (Josephus Antiquities </p>
<p>18:63–64),</p>
<p>164</p>
<p>it becomes expedient that a preliminary hearing be conducted</p>
<p>so as to bring a credible charge before the Romans.</p>
<p>e Jewish Hearing (14:53–65)</p>
<p>With the opening two verses of this passage, Mark introduces us to two set-</p>
<p>tings in which signicant action will take place. e rst is the high priest’s </p>
<p>house,</p>
<p>165</p>
<p>where charges against Jesus will be heard before the chief priests,</p>
<p>161. e classic study is Winter 1961; cf. the later Catchpole 1971, who interacts </p>
<p>copiously with it. A good summary of the issues is provided in Marcus 2009: 1126–30.</p>
