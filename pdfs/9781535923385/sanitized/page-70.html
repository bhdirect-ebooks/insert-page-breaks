<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>4:1–3452</p>
<p>The Kingdom in Parables (4:1–34)</p>
<p>Preamble</p>
<p>Mark has recorded some parabolic teaching of Jesus while depicting him </p>
<p>in debate with his opponents (3:23–27; cf. 2:19–22). But now in chapter 4, </p>
<p>Mark includes an extended parable of Jesus, together with the hermeneuti-</p>
<p>cal key for decoding all parables (v. 13). is major teaching block—one </p>
<p>of two, the other is found in chapter 13—will help Mark’s audience gain a </p>
<p>proper perspective on what has preceded and prepare them for what is to </p>
<p>follow.</p>
<p>In the previous chapters Mark has narrated the reactions of dierent </p>
<p>people (the crowds, the tax-collectors and sinners, the religious authorities, </p>
<p>Jesus’ family) to Jesus’ teaching and deeds. If Jesus’ ministry signies the </p>
<p>dawning of the long-awaited hope of Israel, namely the coming of God’s </p>
<p>kingship, why does it engender dierent responses? e parables in this </p>
<p>chapter go to the heart of the issue by illustrating the nature of the kingdom </p>
<p>that has come through Jesus’ ministry. It is full of paradoxes, and not what </p>
<p>his contemporaries thought it would be.</p>
<p>In this section, we are also informed for the rst time that Jesus teaches </p>
<p>lessons that are exclusively for his disciples. e explanation of the Parable </p>
<p>of the Sower is laden with talk about “insiders” versus “outsiders.” is may </p>
<p>be regarded as a further development of the theme in chapter 3. Not the </p>
<p>outsiders, but the members of God’s family may grasp the essence of Jesus’ </p>
<p>teaching because they will be given special insights (v. 10). </p>
<p>Since this section treats very signicant themes, we should expect </p>
<p>some coherent structure. e key lies in understanding the function of vv. </p>
<p>21–25. If this passage is regarded not as parables but as containing pithy </p>
<p>sayings that provide a counterpoint to the sayings of vv. 10–12, then all the </p>
<p>parables in this chapter feature only seed. e parable placed rst in this </p>
<p>collection (i.e., the Parable of the Sower) may then be regarded as the arche-</p>
<p>type, since the understanding of it opens doors to the other parables (v. 13). </p>
<p>So Mark includes the interpretation of Jesus (vv. 14–20), something which </p>
<p>he does not do for the other parables.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>But can we say vv. 21–25 are not parables? We should rst notice that </p>
<p>they are not explicitly named as such, unlike the three seed parables. It is </p>
<p>better to regard them as disparate sayings that have been strung together. </p>
<p>Secondly, their content diers from that of the other three parables in that </p>
<p>they speak of light and concealment, and not seed and growth. is ts in </p>
<p>78. In vv. 33–34 the fact that Jesus did explain his parables is stated, but not the </p>
<p>content.</p>
