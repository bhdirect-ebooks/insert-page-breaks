<p>On the Road to Jerusalem</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>10:46–52148</p>
<p>may be seen as renouncing all that he has to go to Jesus.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>With this datum</p>
<p>we may see a thematic line connecting us back to 1:14–20 and 2:13–14.</p>
<p>When Bartimaeus comes before Jesus, the latter asks him the same </p>
<p>question he asked of James and John when they came to him (cf. v. 51 with v. </p>
<p>36). But instead of asking to sit either on the right or le of the Son of David, </p>
<p>Bartimaeus asks that he may see! Such a request is indeed natural for a blind </p>
<p>man to make, but in the setting of Mark’s Gospel where perception is such </p>
<p>an important motif, Bartimaeus’s request takes on greater signicance. is </p>
<p>story may then be regarded as a counterpoint to the previous pericope.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>It</p>
<p>provides the right reply that those belonging to the inner circle of Jesus’ dis-</p>
<p>ciples should make. Only by truly seeing could one be an authentic disciple </p>
<p>of Jesus. So it is not surprising that Jesus replies with the signicant: “Your </p>
<p>faith has healed you!” (v. 52). It is faith that will restore sight, both physical </p>
<p>and spiritual. Mark concludes this story with the information that not only </p>
<p>is Bartimaeus’ sight restored, but he also follows Jesus “on the way.”</p>
<p>60. Cf. Ossandón 2012: 377–402, which argues that Bartimaeus is the only charac-</p>
<p>ter who follows Jesus unconditionally.</p>
