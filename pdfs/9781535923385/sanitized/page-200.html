<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>13:1–37182</p>
<p>Maccabean revolt remained an inspiration for many Jews. In this light, Je-</p>
<p>sus’ exhortation is jarring to Jewish ears. Indeed, the implication is that loy-</p>
<p>alty to the covenant will not be shown by an ardent defense of the Temple. </p>
<p>Instead, it is shown by persevering in the gospel.</p>
<p>In such hazardous times, pregnant women, or those who are nurs-</p>
<p>ing children, will suer dreadfully. e words of v. 19 recall Daniel 12:1. </p>
<p>ey must not be interpreted without bearing in mind the context and the </p>
<p>implied geographical limitation. is will preempt the temptation of com-</p>
<p>paring this event with, say, the Holocaust. In the case of the Judeans, no </p>
<p>other event can be equal to this in terms of distress and suering. Stories of </p>
<p>Roman atrocities and great bloodshed abound in many ancient sources.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So dreadful is all this that if God does not shorten it, no one will be le alive. </p>
<p>However, for the sake of the elect—and this must mean those in Israel who </p>
<p>follow Jesus—those days will be shortened (v. 20). From history we know </p>
<p>that the siege of Jerusalem lasted only a few months.</p>

<p>Reiteration of Exhortation (13:21–23)</p>
<p>e trend of thought in this section may be summarized thus. In view of </p>
<p>the fact that calamitous events can be exploited by people to push their own </p>
<p>theological agenda or their own brand of eschatological speculation, Jesus </p>
<p>reiterates his exhortation to his disciples to be alert and discerning. Charla-</p>
<p>tans will perform signs and miracles to claim they are the prophets of God, </p>
<p>or his messiahs. Verse 23 is important for it serves as a sort of inclusio with v. </p>
<p>5, which opened the discourse. rough this inclusio, the Markan audience </p>
<p>will discern that Jesus’ focus is on discernment.</p>
<p>e signicance of v. 21 must not be missed. e words of Jesus as-</p>
<p>sume that false reports of the arrival of the Messiah will be given in those </p>
<p>days. e disciples are warned against believing such reports, and this must </p>
<p>imply that Jesus envisages a situation where he is no longer with them physi-</p>
<p>cally. We then have here the implicit idea of the returning Messiah, and that </p>
<p>his return is ardently expected. Otherwise there is no need for such a warn-</p>
<p>ing. Indeed, the warning against listening to the reports and claims of false </p>
<p>prophets and messiahs invariably raises the question about when the true </p>
<p>Messiah will come. All this implies that the Mark 13 cannot just be about </p>
<p>the Temple’s destruction.</p>
<p>99. Josephus provides a terrifying account of what the Romans did to their captives </p>
<p>in War 5: 449–51. See also Schürer, 1973: 1:507.</p>
<p>100. From Nisan to Ab of AD 70 (i.e., March/April to Jul/August). See Schürer 1973: </p>
<p>1:502–506.</p>
