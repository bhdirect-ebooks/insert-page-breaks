<p>Mark</p>
<p>12:1–44160</p>
<p>Jesus’ Authority Questioned (11:27–33)</p>
<p>is episode ows from the provocative actions Jesus performed in Jeru-</p>
<p>salem. It also serves as the head of a series of stories (11:27—12:44) that </p>
<p>feature Jesus locking horns with the Jewish powers that be. is leads later </p>
<p>to the explicit prediction of the destruction of the Temple in chapter 13. In </p>
<p>some ways these stories mirror those of 2:1—3:6, where controversies are </p>
<p>featured.</p>
<p>Mark locates the present episode in the Temple. ose arrayed against </p>
<p>Jesus are identied as the ruling priests, the scribes and the elders (v. 27), </p>
<p>an august grouping of sacerdotal, learned and traditional authorities. e </p>
<p>two questions asked by them are closely related. e question of “what” asks </p>
<p>Jesus for the nature of his authority. e question of “who” asks him for the </p>
<p>source of that authority. Alternatively, they may be construed as unitary, </p>
<p>with the second reiterating the rst. is is because the Greek poia is oen </p>
<p>used synonymously with tis.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>Jesus’ reply seems to indicate, on a supercial reading, that he is trying </p>
<p>to dodge a dicult question, because he asks an equally (if not more) dif-</p>
<p>cult one. Such a reading is inadequate because it fails to take into account </p>
<p>that Jesus’ identity and ministry are closely linked with John’s baptism. In </p>
<p>fact, it serves to prepare the nation for Jesus. All this means that if John’s </p>
<p>baptism is accepted as having come from heaven, the person of whom John </p>
is a herald should have the divine authority to challenge the Jewish powers
<p>that be. But if these Jewish authorities reject John’s baptism as coming from </p>
<p>heaven, no amount of explanation on the part of Jesus will suce.</p>
<p>So it boils down to the reluctance to believe, not the inability to com-</p>
<p>prehend. As both are sent from heaven, to reject one is to reject the other. </p>
<p>All the Jewish authorities can see is the political liability of Jesus’ actions and </p>
<p>teachings. is is precisely what Mark informs us in vv. 31–32. Since politics </p>
<p>are uppermost in their minds, and not the truth, they have no choice but to </p>
<p>claim ignorance. Confronted with such a group of people, Jesus would be </p>
<p>wasting time explaining the source of his authority. Moreover, any answer </p>
<p>Jesus gives could be twisted for political ends, including the premature ter-</p>
<p>mination of his ministry.</p>
<p>Further Controversies (12:1–44)</p>
<p>Together with 11:27–33, the stories in chapter 12 give the Markan audience </p>
<p>a avor of the issues surrounding Jesus’ ministry in Jerusalem. Signicantly, </p>
