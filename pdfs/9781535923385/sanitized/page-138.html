<p>On the Road to Jerusalem</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>9:2–13120</p>
<p>that they belong to the class of the “deathless ones.”</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>e traditional view</p>
<p>that they represent the Law and the Prophets has no basis in Mark or in </p>
<p>biblical literature, and is rightly rejected by many scholars today.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>e best</p>
<p>answer, in our opinion, is that they both have unique mountaintop experi-</p>
<p>ences, and both are connected to the covenantal story of God and Israel in </p>
<p>which the Exodus concept looms large.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Moses led Israel out of Egypt and</p>
<p>was instrumental in forging a covenant between God and Israel. Elijah was </p>
<p>the covenantal reformer and is expected to return at the end time to prepare </p>
<p>the way for the second Exodus (Mal 4:4–5), through which the denitive </p>
<p>and eschatological people of God will be constituted. Whatever the case, the </p>
<p>focus is on Jesus. Moses and Elijah are key points in the covenantal story, </p>
<p>but Jesus is the climactic point. ey prepare, but he fullls.</p>
<p>Such a magnicent vision certainly stupees ordinary human beings, </p>
<p>and not surprisingly, Peter blurts out comments he has not quite thought </p>
<p>through. Peter’s comment may then be understood as his answer or re-</p>
<p>sponse</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>to the vision (v. 5). What was Peter’s intention when he proposed</p>
<p>to build three booths for these three majestic gures? e making of such </p>
<p>booths is oen connected with the Feast of Tabernacles, through which </p>
<p>Israel recalls the great liberating event of the Exodus (Lev 23:33–43; Num </p>
<p>29:12–38; Neh 8:14–17). Consequently, eschatological signicance is also </p>
<p>given to it, as it reminds the nation of a greater Exodus.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>But if Peter was</p>
<p>thinking of the Feast of Tabernacles, would he not have suggested building </p>
<p>shelters for all six of them and not just three? Recently Heil has suggested </p>
the shelters allude to the Tent of Meeting in which divine revelation was received, and over which the divine presence as a cloud descended (Exod
<p>33:9).</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>Such a suggestion has its merits, but if he is right, why would Peter</p>
<p>propose to build three and not just one? Furthermore, Elijah is never associ-</p>
<p>ated with the Tent of Meeting in Jewish thought. So it seems best to regard </p>
<p>Peter as trying to be hospitable even though he is not thinking clearly when </p>
<p>such words are uttered (9:6).</p>
<p>Verse 7 is crucial for the story. God speaks in response to Peter’s sug-</p>
<p>gestion, and this gives us the hermeneutical key to the whole vision. An </p>
overshadowing cloud is oen used as a symbol of the divine presence, or a

<p>23. e classic statement is in Origen, Commentary on Matthew 12:38.</p>
<p>24. Similarly Marcus 2009: 632, who suggests that it is Mt. Horeb that connects the </p>
<p>two gures.</p>
<p>25. e Greek apokritheis clearly conveys the idea of “responding.”</p>
<p>26. e case is rst made in detail by Riesenfeld 1947. Cf. Rubenstein 1994: 371–87.</p>
