<p>The Gospel in Galilee: The Mighty Acts of the </p>
<p>Messiah (1:14—8:21)</p>
<p>Jesus’ Inaugural Message (1:14–15)</p>
<p>e programmatic signicance of these verses must be highlighted. is is </p>
<p>the rst time that Jesus speaks in Mark’s Gospel, and with this Mark sums up </p>
<p>Jesus’ message. If the preceding section formed the beginning of the gospel, </p>
<p>this passage may be understood as the hinge moment in the gospel story.</p>
<p>Mark prefaces Jesus’ proclamation with the arrest of John. e point </p>
<p>is that the forerunner has done his part, and Mark will explain later why he </p>
<p>was arrested (see 6:17–18). e stronger one who baptizes with the Spirit </p>
<p>(1:7–8) now proclaims. e locality of this proclamation is not in the wil-</p>
<p>derness but in Galilee, a cosmopolitan region belonging to Herod Antipas. </p>
<p>e message concerns the gospel of God. For the alert listener, a connection </p>
<p>between this and 1:1 is at once detected.</p>
<p>e statement of Jesus in v. 15 may be broken into two parts. First he </p>
<p>announces what is happening, and Mark uses the Greek perfect tense here </p>
<p>(peplērōtai and ēngiken) to signify that what Jesus proclaimed continues to </p>
<p>have currency for his readers. Secondly, Jesus counsels a response, and Mark </p>
<p>depicts this with the present tense, signifying that the actions of repentance </p>
<p>and faith are to be ongoing. e key themes of Jesus’ ministry and Mark’s </p>
<p>Gospel are therefore given in a nutshell: fulllment, kingdom, repentance, </p>
<p>faith, and gospel.</p>
<p>Fulllment speaks of plot, with currents reaching back to the past. </p>
<p>What is described as taking place is therefore to be construed as being once </p>
<p>foretold. In this regard, there is meaning to history, and more precisely, it </p>
<p>implies God has been faithful to his promises. It is this quality that gives his </p>
<p>people hope.</p>
<p>e word kingdom (the Greek is basileia) should be understood pri-</p>
<p>marily in the abstract sense of “reign,” rather than in the concrete sense of </p>
<p>“realm,” as the Hebrew malkût or the Aramaic malkûta’ makes clear. But </p>
<p>the two ideas are associated, as reign oen entails realm. Israel believes her </p>
