<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>15:1–20210</p>
<p>is focusing only on the key actions without dwelling on details). Sensing an </p>
<p>opportunity to thwart the chief priests’ plan, Pilate turns to the Jewish crowd </p>
<p>and asks them whether they want Jesus released. e rejection of the crowd </p>
<p>is poignant. What was oered to them was the king of the Jews and but they </p>
<p>wanted Barabbas,</p>
<p>185</p>
<p>a murderer, instead (vv. 9–11). Mark informs us that</p>
<p>behind the crowd’s rejection of Jesus lay the inuence and maneuvering of </p>
<p>the chief priests (v. 11). More seriously, the crowd wants Jesus crucied—</p>
<p>punished with the most painful sort of sentence reserved only for slaves and </p>
<p>seditious people (v. 13). When asked to reconsider, the crowd only hardens </p>
<p>its resolve (v. 14). Indeed, in the Markan narrative this crowd speaks only </p>
<p>two words and nothing else: “Crucify him” (the Greek is staurōson auton). </p>
<p>And this is all there is to their eloquence. Up until now the verb “crucify” </p>
<p>has not been used in Mark’s tale (but cf.8:34where the noun is used) and it </p>
<p>must be intentional that the rst use of the word in Mark’s narrative belongs </p>
<p>to the Jewish crowd. Crucixion may be described as one of the cruelest </p>
<p>form of punishment, as the victim is not only slowly tortured to death but </p>
<p>also shamed and made a public example.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p>It is a punishment greatly feared</p>
<p>by Jews, as crucied victims are regarded as cursed (cf. Gal3:13).</p>
<p>e die is now cast. Both leaders and people want Jesus dead. And why </p>
<p>should a Roman prefect, who has no respect for the Jewish people, stand up </p>
<p>for an accused Jew? So even if Pilate knows that trumped-up charges have </p>
<p>been made against Jesus (cf. v. 10), he acquiesces. Barabbas is duly released, </p>
<p>and Jesus sentenced to be crucied. In keeping with Roman practise, Jesus </p>
<p>is ogged, as a preliminary to crucixion (Josephus War 2:306–308; 5:449; </p>
<p>7:200–202).e word “og” and its Greek counterpart (phragelloō) are bor-</p>
<p>rowed from the Latin agello. e term denotes a lashing with whips that </p>
<p>are normally made of leather, and may sometimes have metal or bone pieces </p>
<p>at their tips. is ensures the whips cut deeply into a person’s esh so as </p>
<p>to inict maximum pain. True to Jesus’ prediction, the Gentiles have now </p>
<p>taken over the process of executing him (see10:33–34).</p>
<p>Jesus Mocked by Roman Soldiers (15:16–20)</p>
<p>Jesus is now in the hands of the Roman soldiers for torture and execution. </p>
<p>Led into the Praetorium (i.e., the ocial residence of the Roman prefect),</p>
<p>187</p>
<p> </p>
<p>he is now subjected to sadistic insults and torture. e operative principle </p>
<p>185. Barabbas means “son of Abba,” and “Abba” here can refer either to God or </p>
<p>Abraham. See Abrahams 1924: 2:202.</p>
