<p>On the Road to Jerusalem</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>10:32–45144</p>
<p>e Lesson on True Greatness Once More (10:41–45)</p>
<p>e misguided and ambitious request of James and John understandably </p>
<p>gives rise to unhappiness on the part of the other disciples. To defuse this </p>
<p>tense situation, and to extend the lesson to the rest of the company, Jesus </p>
<p>calls the Twelve together and teaches them what true greatness is. He begins </p>
<p>with the Gentile concept of greatness: the great person is he who has the </p>
<p>authority to lord it over many (v. 42). e disciples’ perspective on greatness </p>
<p>should be the opposite: the greatest is he who has the most to serve. is </p>
<p>revolutionary value has its basis in the vocation of the Son of Man.</p>
<p>In order for its full signicance to be grasped, the Danielic background </p>
<p>of the Son of Man idea must be kept in mind. To reiterate, the Danielic Son </p>
<p>of Man is he who will be given the kingdom, and through his work the saints </p>
<p>of the Most High are to be vindicated (Dan 7:13–14). In this regard, the </p>
<p>gure speaks of vindication, triumph, and glory. But in Jesus’ interpretation, </p>
<p>this gure is combined with the Suering Servant in Isaiah 53, to which </p>
<p>some key ideas of Mark 10:45 allude (see excursus). Hence, the Son of Man </p>
<p>comes not to be served but to serve,</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>and to give his life as a ransom for</p>
<p>many. erefore, Jesus gives a powerful corrective to the disciples’ delusions </p>
<p>of grandeur. is story then serves as the climax to all the teaching Jesus is </p>
<p>giving his disciples, in preparation for Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Excursus: The Suffering Servant of Isaiah 53 and Mark 10:45</p>
<p>We have argued consistently that in the Markan context the phrase “Son of </p>
<p>Man” is to be understood primarily against the Danielic background, with-</p>
<p>out denying the possibility of creative re-interpretation on the part of Jesus. </p>
<p>However, the concepts of “service” and “giving one’s life as a ransom” are </p>
<p>best understood against the background of the Suffering Servant of Isaiah </p>
<p>53. This implies Jesus is appropriating scriptural traditions and stories, </p>
<p>and understanding these to be an integral whole. So he can combine the </p>
<p>Danielic image of the Son of Man with the Isaianic image of the Suffering </p>
<p>Servant to clarify his vocation. Mark 10:45 may then be regarded as highly </p>
<p>signiﬁcant not just for understanding Jesus’ sense of mission and vocation, </p>
<p>but also his concept of Scripture.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>51. Cf. Gathercole, “Son of Man,” where he argues that Jesus reversed the connota-</p>
<p>tions associated with the Son of Man gure in Daniel 7:14.</p>
<p>52. e Jesus of the Gospels focuses more on the storyline of Scripture than on </p>
<p>minute exegesis of passages, and oen synthesizes passages to create meaning that is </p>
