<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>8:10–21108</p>
<p>shepherd has enacted in a denitive way the second Exodus. is second </p>
<p>Exodus is a closely allied concept with the kingdom. Secondly, the feeding </p>
<p>stories show that both Jews and Gentiles may be beneciaries of the king-</p>
<p>dom. e eschatological shepherd feeds them both. irdly, the focus on </p>
<p>the leovers in Jesus’ questioning emphasizes the abundance of such provi-</p>
<p>sions. ere is a generosity to the kingdom that the disciples have yet to </p>
<p>fully appreciate. ey, like many of Jesus’ interlocutors, are still thinking of </p>
<p>the earthly, not grasping the spiritual truths of his ministry. e issue is not </p>
<p>so much whether they believe Jesus can provide bread; more profoundly, it </p>
<p>has to do with the transformation of a deeply entrenched kingdom vision—</p>
<p>something that will require a lot of time, eort and teaching.</p>
<p>How does Herod t into all this? His vision may be seen as represent-</p>
<p>ing the non-Jewish viewpoint, where to rule means to exercise power. Here </p>
<p>religion serves only to bolster one’s political position, and may be conve-</p>
<p>niently sidelined or violently removed when that religion calls into question </p>
<p>the ruler’s ethics (6:14–29). e kingdom is not about intrigue or eliminat-</p>
<p>ing opponents to seize power (something Mark will return to in chapter </p>
<p>10). e irony is that both the Pharisees and Herod, bitter enemies as they </p>
<p>may be, actually have similar kingdom-visions. ey want something that is </p>
<p>openly glorious, with the vindication of their own group, and the elimina-</p>
<p>tion of enemies. It becomes clear why it is imperative that the pure bread of </p>
<p>the true kingdom must not be corrupted by the yeast of triumphalism and </p>
<p>narrow-mindedness.</p>
<p>So Jesus’ one refrain is, “Do you still not understand?” e disciples </p>
<p>are the “insiders” but display attributes of the “outsiders”—they have eyes </p>
<p>but do not see; they are taught repeatedly but do not yet understand (vv. </p>
<p>17–18; cf. 4:12). e least Mark’s audience can gather from all this is that to </p>
<p>be a true disciple of Jesus is never easy, for it involves a revolution of values </p>
and outlook. is is achievable not by human strength but divine grace.
