<p>situation of the disciples or that of the church, or perhaps both. Respectively </p>
<p>it means either that Jesus’ presence is sucient to meet the physical needs </p>
<p>of the disciples even though they do not have sucient provisions, or that </p>
<p>the Eucharist Jesus instituted is sucient for whatever needs the Church </p>
<p>may have. It is hard to be certain whether such symbolic undertones are to </p>
<p>be detected, when the narrative as it stands makes perfect sense without any </p>
<p>recourse to symbolism. e Markan syntax, clumsy as it may be to some </p>
<p>rened writer, makes its point quite clearly: the disciples have forgotten to </p>
<p>bring ample provisions, but they do have one physical loaf with them in the </p>
<p>boat.</p>
<p>In line with the above suggestion, Gibson has recently proposed that </p>
<p>the Markan syntax is entirely appropriate if we posit the following. e dis-</p>
<p>ciples deliberately carried only one loaf with them in order to prevent Jesus </p>
<p>from performing another bread-multiplying miracle on Gentile soil. Jesus’ </p>
<p>warning then is that they should watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and </p>
<p>of Herod, because both these groups do not accept Jesus’ kingdom vision. </p>
<p>e upshot of this is that the disciples’ deliberate neglect is for keeping the </p>
<p>messianic blessings within Israel.</p>
<p>193</p>
<p>As attractive as this hypothesis is, there</p>
<p>are some insuperable problems,</p>
<p>194</p>
<p>the chief of which concerns the meaning</p>
<p>of the verb epilanthanomai (v. 14). For the hypothesis to stand, it must be </p>
<p>translated as “(deliberately) neglecting” which is not what it usually means. </p>
<p>It means simply “to forget.” In other words, it is unintentional.</p>
<p>Perhaps, it is wise not to read too much symbolism into the bare state-</p>
<p>ment of v. 14. Instead, we should construe Jesus as using the occasion as a </p>
<p>stepping stone to an important teaching, namely that of avoiding the yeast of </p>
<p>the Pharisees and of Herod. is prompts the disciples to wonder whether </p>
<p>the remark is given because they have forgotten to bring ample provisions. </p>
<p>And this raises another problem. How could the disciples think that Jesus </p>
<p>was concerned over their paltry resource, when he had already performed </p>
<p>two multiplying miracles? Doesn’t this make them incredibly obtuse?</p>
<p>Truth may sometimes be stranger than ction, or perhaps the clumsi-</p>
<p>ness in the construction of the episode arises from Mark’s desire to relate </p>
<p>the theological with the historical in one breath. Whether or not Mark has </p>
<p>been fair to the disciples, his intention must not be missed: the feeding </p>
<p>miracles have deeper meanings that are not easily grasped by all (enemies </p>
<p>and disciples included). We may tentatively unpack the signicance as fol-</p>
<p>lows. First, these feeding miracles are not simply performed to feed but, </p>
<p>more importantly, to demonstrate that the compassionate eschatological </p>
