<p>e Climax of the Gospel Mark 14:1—15:47194</p>
<p>betrayed by a close associate.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>is understandably leads to sadness in the</p>
<p>company, and questions about the identity of this person.</p>
<p>Jesus’ reply deepens the discomfort. He repeats the point that it will be </p>
<p>one of the Twelve who will betray him, with a heightening of the intimacy </p>
<p>involved (v. 18). Not only does this person eat with Jesus, but he will also </p>
<p>be dipping bread into the same bowl with him. If a dastardly deed such as </p>
<p>this can happen to Jesus, does it mean the movement he started is falling </p>
<p>apart, and his ministry heading for irretrievable loss? So the statement of v. </p>
<p>21 plays an important function by preempting such thoughts, as it speaks </p>
<p>of the fulllment of Scripture. e dastardly deed is inscrutably connected </p>
<p>with God’s plan. What this Scripture is, Mark does not tell us.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>In other words, as horrifying as the news may be, underlying it is a </p>
<p>note of hope. Scripture is being fullled and God’s will is being done. e </p>
<p>wrath of man is still under the control of God and may thus be directed to-</p>
<p>wards ends that are faithful to his covenantal promises. Note that the use of </p>
<p>the title “Son of Man” in this connection is important (v. 21). It harmonizes </p>
<p>with the Markan depiction of the Son of Man as someone who is not only </p>
<p>the kingdom inaugurator, but also one who suers for human redemption. </p>
<p>Furthermore, it reminds the audience that the person whom Judas is betray-</p>
<p>ing is no ordinary mortal.</p>
<p>e theme of betrayal prepares for the narration of the meal proper. </p>
<p>As the presider of the meal, Jesus leads the Passover liturgy. is liturgy </p>
<p>ingrains in the minds of the Jewish nation the story of the Exodus, and the </p>
divine election through which a covenant is established. In this way the
<p>founding story of the nation—the story which gives the people their unique </p>
<p>identity—is constantly retold (see excursus). But this is no ordinary Pass-</p>
<p>over meal, as Jesus transforms it by juxtaposing his story with the story of </p>
<p>the Exodus. e broken and distributed bread is interpreted as Jesus’ body. </p>
<p>e words uttered over the bread in the traditional Passover liturgy probably </p>
<p>went something like this: “is is the bread of aiction which our fathers </p>
<p>ate in the land of Egypt. Let everyone who hungers come and eat; let every-</p>
<p>one who is needy come and eat the Passover meal.”</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>But Jesus transforms</p>
<p>its meaning, and denes it according to his own identity and vocation. e </p>
<p>Greek word sōma probably translates an underlying Aramaic gĕšēm, which </p>
<p>is used to signify not just the physical body (esh), but also physical life. In </p>
<p>eect Jesus is saying that just as the bread is oered to the disciples, so also </p>
