<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>13:1–37176</p>
<p>this regard we should note that the discourse is rst and foremost about the </p>
<p>Temple’s destruction, and the “end of the world” is not its main focus.</p>
<p>As Jesus leaves the Temple, one of his disciples remarks enthusiasti-</p>
<p>cally about the stones and the buildings in the complex. Such remarks are </p>
<p>perfectly natural, as the Second Temple is the most magnicent building in </p>
<p>Jerusalem. It even has the reputation of being the most beautiful building </p>
<p>in the entire world (Josephus War 5:184–226; cf. b. Suk. 51b; b. B. Bat. 4a). </p>
<p>Built as a small structure aer the exiles returned, it was extensively refur-</p>
<p>bished and enlarged by Herod the Great, such that one may even speak of </p>
<p>it as being a new Temple. e refurbishment project started around 20 BC. </p>
<p>e bulk of it was completed in probably eight years, but the full completion </p>
<p>came only a few years before its destruction in AD 70. Some of the stones </p>
<p>used are still standing today in what is now known to many as the “Wail-</p>
<p>ing Wall.” Any visitor to Jerusalem today can appreciate what the Temple </p>
<p>would have looked like, just by a glance at the massive stones still standing. </p>
<p>Indeed, from Josephus we learn that some of these stones measured 67 feet </p>
<p>long (War 5:224). One stone that was recently excavated by archaeologists </p>
<p>actually measured 42 feet long, 11 feet high, and 14 feet deep.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p> It is esti-</p>
<p>mated that the entire complex was about 1500 feet by 700 feet, and took up </p>
<p>about one-sixth of the city’s space.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>When viewed from afar, with the sun</p>
<p>shining on it, its gold and marble makes it resplendent in glorious colors </p>
<p>(Josephus War 5:222–23). is magnicent building is indeed worthy of </p>
<p>being the symbol of Israel’s election. Indeed, a few decades aer Jesus’ cru-</p>
<p>cixion, it serves as the center of operations for the revolt against Rome, and </p>
<p>is defended to the end.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>All this explains the exuberance of the disciple’s</p>
<p>remark. However, Jesus gives an unexpected response. He predicts that not </p>
<p>one stone will be le on another (v. 2).</p>
<p>Jesus’ prediction is fascinating in that it does not mention any destruc-</p>
<p>tion by re. According to Josephus, the Temple was rst destroyed by re in </p>
<p>AD 70 by Titus and his troops, and only razed to the ground months later </p>
<p>(cf. War 6:250; 7:1–4). e omission of this datum may indicate that Mark </p>
<p>writes before AD 70, since he is not averse to giving editorial comments or </p>
<p>explanations. e reason for Jesus’ mentioning only stones may be that he </p>
<p>is using a biblical idiom (2 Sam 17:13; cf. LXX Hag 2:15), a sort of stock </p>
<p>phrase, or adapting his answer to the disciples’ description, as they were </p>
<p>impressed by the massive stones.</p>
