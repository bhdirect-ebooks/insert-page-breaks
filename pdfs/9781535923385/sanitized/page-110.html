<p>Excursus: Food and the Tradition of the Elders92</p>
<p>ordinary food, but only to consecrated food that priests eat (m. Para. 11:5). </p>
<p>That said, it would be premature to think that Mark has been unreliable in </p>
<p>this matter. First, a good case may be made for there being a relaxation of </p>
<p>strict regulations after the two tragic wars fought with Rome in AD 66–70 </p>
<p>and 132–35. So what is written in the Mishnah does not fully reﬂect what </p>
<p>took place in the years before these two great wars. Secondly, it is a well-</p>
<p>nigh consensus among scholars that the Pharisees may be typiﬁed as a </p>
<p>movement which sought to extend the purity of the temple to the home </p>
<p>(see excursus on Pharisees). So for Pharisees to be particularly interested </p>
<p>in this issue should not be surprising. Finally, the practice of praying with </p>
<p>washed hands was widespread in the Diaspora (Epistle of Aristeas 305). </p>
<p>Since prayers often preceded the partaking of food, eating with washed </p>
<p>hands was the usual practice. This could itself become a boundary marker, </p>
<p>separating the Jews from the Gentiles. All this means Mark can justiﬁably </p>
<p>paint with a broad brush by including other Jews in this Pharisaic interest.</p>
<p>Jesus replies by quoting Isaiah (Isa 29:13) to show that what once obtained </p>
<p>in the nation remains, albeit in a dierent form (vv. 6–8). In its original </p>
<p>context, God was rebuking the Israelites for their supercial religious ob-</p>
<p>servances. In using this text, Jesus implies that this condition is present </p>
<p>among his interlocutors, the religious leaders, who are also denounced as </p>
<p>“hypocrites.” e Greek word hypocritēs is used only once in Mark. Its rarity </p>
<p>belies its importance, for the use of this word heightens the poignancy. It </p>
<p>meant play-acting originally. Hence, tragically, what the Pharisees and some </p>
<p>religious leaders are striving to achieve is illusory, possible only as a play on </p>
<p>stage. According to the evidence available, Pharisees were oen pejoratively </p>
<p>described as such through the use of similar terms (Josephus Antiquities </p>
<p>17:41; 1QH 4:7–15).</p>
<p>Jesus’ charge then is that although their practice conforms to the ex-</p>
<p>ternal requirements, their hearts are actually far from their original intent. </p>
<p>e purity code was given by the God of Israel not for its own sake but to </p>
<p>serve as a reminder of his holiness. A holy God can only be approached by </p>
<p>a holy people and not by one who tries to circumvent the force of certain </p>
<p>commandments.</p>
<p>As an instance of such play-acting, Jesus cites the provision which, </p>
<p>aer being developed by many years of traditioning, relates to the h </p>
<p>commandment. e nancial support of impoverished parents could be set </p>
<p>aside by invoking the practice of “Corban” (see excursus). Jews understand </p>
