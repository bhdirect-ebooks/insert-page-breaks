<p>Fusing the Horizons: Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit 51</p>
<p>ness? Using the OT as a resource, we see that in the prophetic promises, </p>
<p>God’s end-time restoration of Israel involves also the forgiveness of her sins </p>
<p>(Isa 40:2; 43:25; 44:22; Jer 31:34; 33:8; Ezek 36:33), as it was sin that </p>
<p>brought about her exile in the ﬁrst place. The end-time restoration is to be </p>
<p>achieved by the powerful work of the eschatological Spirit, who is also the </p>
<p>agent of cleansing, revelation and regeneration (Isa 32:14–20; 59:15–21; </p>
<p>Ezek 36:24–36; 37:1–14; 39:21–29). Without his work, restoration could </p>
<p>not occur and Israel would be regarded as being still in her sins. Although </p>
<p>the Spirit is not said expressly to bring about forgiveness of sins, we can in-</p>
<p>fer this from his work of cleansing, restoring and regenerating: these aspects </p>
<p>sum up God’s deﬁnitive return to his people to repair the broken covenantal </p>
<p>relationship once and for all.</p>
<p>This restoration, Jesus claims, is taking place in his ministry as the </p>
<p>eschatological Spirit moves mightily through him to bring about the collapse </p>
<p>of Satan’s kingdom. Once this logic is appreciated, it can be seen that </p>
<p>when the work of the Spirit is rejected, there can be no way of entering this </p>
<p>eschatological kingdom of God. In brief, the rejection of the Spirit’s work is </p>
<p>a rejection of God’s program of restoration and redemption. Eschatological </p>
<p>overtures when maliciously slandered — and so resisted — can only result </p>
<p>in an eschatological (eternal) destiny. The opponents of Jesus have thus </p>
<p>painted themselves into a corner. If the only cure is rejected, how else can </p>
<p>they be cured?</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>From the Markan perspective, it also appears that the work of the </p>
<p>Spirit in relation to the irruption of the kingdom is expressed signiﬁcantly in </p>
<p>exorcism. Mark has already indicated this by narrating Jesus’ ﬁrst spectacu-</p>
<p>lar deed as an exorcism (1:21–28), shortly after the Spirit descended upon </p>
<p>him. The implication is that maligning Jesus’ exorcisms takes on greater </p>
<p>gravity than maligning Jesus’ other miracles.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to emphasize that this sin is not committed whenever </p>
<p>any accusation of demonic inspiration is made against any Christian exor-</p>
<p>cist. Instead, Jesus’ warning is valid only in so far as the accusation is made </p>
<p>against his ministry of exorcism. Hence, Christians should not jump to the </p>
<p>conclusion that whoever speaks against Christianity today, even if it is done </p>
<p>in vitriolic terms, has committed this very particular sin. So the present </p>
<p>story speaks as much of Jesus’ unique status as the reverence that is to be </p>
<p>given to the Spirit.</p>
