<p>scribe manages to pick up the cue of Jesus and indeed utilizes his mind well. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the scribe uses three modiers in his reply, as Deuteronomy </p>
<p>6:5 does. But he includes Jesus’ unique modier and omits “with all your </p>
<p>soul” (v. 33)!</p>
<p>e fundamental relationality of the greatest commandment serves </p>
<p>as the springboard for the giving of the second commandment. Love for </p>
<p>God is actualized in love for neighbor.Although the love for neighbor is </p>
<p>regarded as something of great importance to many Jews of Jesus’ day, all </p>
<p>the extant evidence points to Jesus as the only one who combines it with the </p>
<p>Shema.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>In its original OT context, the phrase “as yourself” in Lev 19:18</p>
<p>may be understood adjectivally or adverbially. e former produces the nu-</p>
<p>ance of loving your neighbor because that neighbor is somehow also “you.” </p>
<p>is emphasizes the communal dimension. e latter produces the nuance </p>
<p>of loving the neighbor in the same manner as you love yourself. Neither </p>
<p>meaning excludes the other. at said, many OT scholars think that because </p>
<p>of the occurrence of a similar phrase in Lev 19:34, the phrase “as yourself” </p>
<p>should be interpreted adjectivally.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p> If this is the case, the immediate hori-</p>
<p>zon the scribe may be thinking of would be the members of the covenant </p>
<p>community. Of course there is an interesting twist to this concept of neigh-</p>
<p>bor in Jesus’ telling of the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25–37), </p>
<p>but that is another story.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>e scribe agrees with Jesus but also sees an important implication. </p>
<p>Using language reminiscent of Hosea 6:6, he concludes that burnt oerings </p>
<p>and sacrices are secondary (v. 33). In other words, he understands that </p>
<p>election (i.e., being the special people of God) is not bound up with the </p>
<p>Temple and its sacricial system (v. 34). So the scribe is in a position to </p>
<p>see that although Jesus has demonstrated against the Temple and implicitly </p>
<p>enacted its destruction, this does not mean he is against Torah.</p>
<p>is elicits from Jesus the observation that the scribe has answered </p>
<p>wisely, and so is close to the kingdom (v. 34). Indeed,this is the only in-</p>
<p>stance in Mark’s Gospel, where Jesus commends a scribe. To put the Shema </p>
<p>above the Temple, and love above the cult takes him to the heart of Torah. </p>
<p>And if the kingdom means the fulllment of Torah, grasping the essence of </p>
<p>Torah places one in close proximity to God’s kingdom.</p>
