<p>transparent to all. e coded language may be unraveled only by insiders </p>
<p>who understand Scriptures and Jesus’ ministry.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>We may summarize the</p>
<p>clues given: the abomination of desolation speaks of a great sacrilege of the </p>
<p>Temple, but this is not apparent to all; special insight is needed to see that it </p>
<p>is so; when it happens Judeans—and not all Israel—are to ee.</p>
<p>e above prepares us to decode the sign given in v. 14. e strange </p>
<p>Greek syntax needs closer scrutiny. e word bdelygma (“abomination”) is </p>
<p>neuter in gender, but it is later modied by a participle in the masculine </p>
<p>(the Greek is hestēkota). So we may ask, “Is Jesus referring to a thing</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>or a</p>
<p>person?”</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>In other words, is he referring to something that is set up as an</p>
<p>abomination, or to someone who is the abomination? Our view is it refers </p>
<p>to an event, but brought about by human agency.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>Someone will set himself</p>
<p>up, out of pure caprice or pressured by others, and brings about an abomi-</p>
<p>nation that leads to desecration.</p>
<p>e exact event that Jesus is referring to has teased many scholarly </p>
<p>minds. e chief proposals are: (i) Caligula’s attempt to place his image in </p>
<p>the Temple;</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> (ii) the Zealot party’s appointing their own high priest dur-</p>
<p>ing the Jewish Revolt, which also featured much internecine strife (War </p>
<p>4:147–57);</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>(iii) the desecration by Titus’s troops when they sacriced to</p>
<p>their standards aer quelling the Jewish revolt;</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> and (iv) the awaited Anti-</p>
<p>christ.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>Option (ii) is what we support, and the justication for this will be</p>
<p>made below. But we start with the options we reject.</p>
<p>Caligula certainly wanted his image to be set up in the Temple and </p>
be regarded as divine. e trouble with this proposal is that this intention
<p>was never realized, as he was persuaded to rescind the edict (Josephus </p>
<p>Antiquities 18:261, 271). Option (iii) is certainly related to the desecration </p>
<p>of the Jerusalem Temple. Aer storming it and defeating the Jewish resis-</p>
<p>tance, Titus’ troops sacriced to their standards in the Temple (Josephus </p>
<p>War 6:316; cf. also 6:260, where it is recorded that Titus and his generals </p>
<p>went into the inner sanctum of the Temple). However, all this was done aer </p>
<p>the Temple had been destroyed. It could not therefore serve as a sign of its </p>
<p>destruction, as signs are always chronologically prior to the events. Option </p>
