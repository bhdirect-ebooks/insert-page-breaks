<p>Transguration and Transformation of Expectations 123</p>
<p>relate the realizing of God’s kingship to the role of the Suering Servant. </p>
<p>If we are right about the primary background to Jesus’ use of the Son of </p>
<p>Man title (i.e., Dan 7 and the kingdom connection), it is not impossible to </p>
<p>imagine someone who is steeped in Scriptures combining all these aspects.</p>
<p>e next statement about Elijah’s being maltreated by men (v. 13) is </p>
<p>unexpected but a moment’s reection will show that it is nevertheless rel-</p>
<p>evant to the trend of thought started, in that it serves two purposes. e </p>
<p>rst is that it aligns Elijah’s work with the Son of Man’s. One has been ill-</p>
<p>treated, so would the other. It is all of a piece, perhaps indicating that God </p>
<p>is behind such a revolutionary idea. Secondly, the statement serves to point </p>
<p>in a cryptic way to the identity of this Elijah. If Elijah has come and suered, </p>
<p>the natural question that follows is who is he and where may he be found? </p>
<p>Although Mark does not give us his identity explicitly (cf. however, 6:14–15 </p>
<p>and Matt 11:14), his Christian audience would easily think of John the Bap-</p>
<p>tist, as he was the forerunner of Christ.</p>
<p>Perhaps surprising for readers today, Jesus states that it is written that </p>
<p>Elijah must rst suer. Did the OT really prophesy that Elijah must suer? </p>
<p>One possible answer is to think of the trials of the rst Elijah. By invoking </p>
<p>the Jewish exegetical concept of typology, the second Elijah may be said to </p>
<p>undergo a similar experience.</p>
<p>With all the above said, what must not be missed is the narrative func-</p>
<p>tion of the story of the Transguration and the present story. Both combine </p>
<p>to teach Jesus’ followers that glory and suering need not be prised apart. </p>
<p>Jesus is truly that glorious Son of Man, but it is written that he must suer. </p>
<p>is is true also for Elijah. He has indeed come, signaling that all things are </p>
<p>being restored. What they must not forget is that he too has been ill-treated </p>
<p>by his contemporaries. All this serves as a further response to Peter’s rebuke </p>
<p>of Jesus in 8:32, and a further explication of 9:1.</p>
<p>Excursus: Elijah must ﬁrst come</p>
<p>It should be emphasized that Mark 9:11 is ambiguous about who or what </p>
<p>exactly Elijah is to precede. However, since the question of Jesus’ identity </p>
<p>is hovering in the background, readers may justiﬁably think of Mark as im-</p>
<p>plicitly saying that Elijah comes as a forerunner of the Messiah.</p>
<p>This is where the problem begins, as nowhere in Scripture is Elijah </p>
<p>said to come as a forerunner of the Messiah, although in Mal 4:5–6 he is </p>
<p>said to herald the day of the Lord. This day refers not to a 24-hour period </p>
<p>but an event. The event that is envisaged is God’s great coming to his </p>
