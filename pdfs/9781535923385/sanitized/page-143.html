<p>e Boy with the Unclean Spirit 125</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, Jesus is soon informed of the boy’s condition </p>
<p>and the disciples’ failure in vv. 17–18. His response in v. 19 indicates that </p>
<p>a deep malaise is at work. e label of “unbelieving generation” is applied </p>
<p>to his disciples because they stand foursquare with their contemporaries </p>
<p>as people who have little or no faith (cf. 8:12). Brought before Jesus, the </p>
<p>unclean evil spirit immediately throws the boy to the ground, making him </p>
<p>convulse and foam at the mouth (v. 20).</p>
<p>e ensuing dialogue between Jesus and the boy’s father (vv. 21–24) </p>
<p>oers a fascinating insight into how faith germinates and grows. e father’s </p>
<p>desperation surfaces upon the description of the woes of the boy. His plea is </p>
<p>passionate and evokes sympathy. His words “if you can” probably indicate </p>
<p>he thinks Jesus may not be up to the task, rather than that Jesus may not </p>
<p>be willing to do so. At this stage, faith is still not present. Jesus’ challenge </p>
<p>in v. 23 throws the responsibility back at him. e question is not whether </p>
<p>Jesus can but whether he has faith, for everything is possible for him who </p>
<p>believes. As it is the case in 6:5–6, Jesus does not perform miracles when </p>
<p>there is unbelief. Realizing that the responsibility is his, the father cries out </p>
<p>for help: “I believe; help my unbelief!” is oxymoron indicates the turmoil </p>
<p>the father is going through. Faith has germinated but it is weak, and so there </p>
<p>is a cry for help. But faith, however weak, is still faith and the exorcism is </p>
<p>duly performed (vv. 25–27).</p>
<p>e disciples want an explanation of their failure when they are alone </p>
<p>with Jesus in the house (v. 28). Mark does not say whose house it is, but he </p>
<p>consistently sets the private teaching of Jesus for his disciples in a house. </p>
<p>Jesus’ reply emphasizes the importance of prayer. e meaning of this is </p>
<p>examined in “Fusing the Horizons” below. Most Greek manuscripts add the </p>
<p>phrase “and fasting,” which is missing in the early manuscripts (fourth cen-</p>
<p>tury). Almost all scholars regard this phrase as having been added by scribes </p>
<p>in the interest of bolstering ascetic practices, or explaining more clearly why </p>
<p>the exorcism failed.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Prayer and the Disciples’ Failure</p>
<p>In Jesus’ explanation of the failure of the disciples to cast out the demon, </p>
<p>the blame is not placed on the lack of faith on the part of the boy’s father. </p>
<p>To be sure, lack of faith is a grave problem, as Mark’s Gospel frequently cas-</p>
<p>tigates it. That said, what remains fascinating is that the blame is assigned </p>
<p>solely to the disciples’ failure in prayer. As it is quite incredible that the </p>
<p>disciples did not engage in prayer, does Jesus mean they did not pray hard </p>
