<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>6.6b–3080</p>
<p>Roman law. Rather, it was because the levitical rules governing marriage </p>
(Lev 18:16; 20:21) did not allow a man to marry the divorced wife of a
<p>brother who was still alive.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p> is explains why John’s criticism was power-</p>
<p>ful: it came from a man respected for his religious views. Furthermore, it </p>
<p>had great political liability for Herod Antipas because he was regarded as </p>
<p>not properly Jewish, and therefore not properly the ruler of the Jews (cf. </p>
<p>Josephus War 1:123; Josephus Antiquities 14:9). Any outing of Jewish sen-</p>
<p>sibilities would make his position even more untenable.</p>
<p>In Mark’s account, the prime movers are two women (something </p>
<p>which Josephus does not mention): a mother and a daughter. ere is a </p>
<p>textual problem here. Some early manuscripts (א B D) read “his daughter </p>
<p>Herodias,”</p>
<p>135</p>
<p> instead of “the daughter of Herodias.”</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>e latter reading is</p>
<p>attested later (A C Θ). If we follow the reading which has the earlier attesta-</p>
<p>tion—and the harder reading—Mark is saying it was Antipas’s daughter, by </p>
<p>the name of Herodias, who performed. But the account seems to suggest </p>
<p>it was Herodias’s daughter who performed. e possibility that Herodias’s </p>
<p>daughter was also known as Herodias seems rather remote. Moreover, if Jo-</p>
<p>sephus is reliable at this point, Herodias’s daughter should be called Salome </p>
<p>(Antiquities 18:136), who was also (later?) married to Philip the Tetrarch. </p>
<p>Hence, the NIV’s choice is probably correct.</p>
<p>Semitic decorum would not usually permit a daughter, let alone a </p>
<p>royal one, to dance to please banqueting men. What should be remembered, </p>
<p>however, is that Herod’s household was highly Romanized.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>is being the</p>
<p>case, it would follow Roman customs much more readily than Jewish ones. </p>
<p>Roman customs allowed for agrant display of eroticism. e dance could </p>
<p>not be an ordinary kind, as it would not explain Antipas’s over-generous </p>
<p>oer in v. 23.</p>
<p>Antipas’s oer of up to half of his kingdom appears at rst sight to be </p>
<p>an incredible reward for a dance. However, three mitigating factors must be </p>
<p>borne in mind. First, the expression may be a hyperbole and is not there-</p>
<p>fore meant to be taken literally. In this case, it connotes a good oer rather </p>
<p>than denoting a mathematically precise y percent of the kingdom (cf. </p>
<p>Esth 5:3, 6; 7:2). Secondly, it is well-known that drunken men oen made </p>
<p>promises that were exaggerated, with no intention of fulllment. Finally, it </p>
<p>was not uncommon in those days even for sober royalty to make extremely </p>
<p>134. Josephus levelled a similar criticism, but targeting mainly Herodias, in Antiq-</p>
<p>uities 18: 136.</p>
