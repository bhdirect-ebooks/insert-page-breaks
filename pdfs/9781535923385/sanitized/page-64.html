<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>3:13–4546</p>
<p>translated as “made,”</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>with a possible allusion to the story of creation. Jesus’</p>
<p>action in calling the Twelve is like a new creational act.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>Furthermore, the</p>
<p>number Twelve alludes to the twelve tribes of Israel: their formation and </p>
<p>promised reconstitution (Isa 49:6; Ezek 45:8; cf. Matt 19:28; Luke 22:30), </p>
<p>made urgent by the two deportations from the land in 721 BC (Northern </p>
<p>Kingdom) and 586 BC (Southern Kingdom). In this light, the use of such a </p>
<p>term to designate his disciples speaks volumes about Jesus’ intention.</p>
<p>e term “apostles” should most probably be understood in the light </p>
<p>of the rabbinic concept of the šālîah. is refers to a legal agent who is sent </p>
<p>out with the full authority of the sender, to act on his behalf. A memorable </p>
<p>sentence captures this concept: “e one sent by a man is as the man him-</p>
<p>self” (m. Ber. 5:5). e main functions of the apostles are also described (vv. </p>
<p>13–15). First of all, they are to be with him. is denes succinctly what </p>
<p>discipleship means. By being with Jesus they can know him intimately and </p>
<p>understand his teaching. It also implies that they will be taught things not </p>
<p>available to the crowds. From this point onwards, Mark will recount stories </p>
<p>where Jesus’ disciples ask questions of Jesus privately, or relate teaching situ-</p>
<p>ations involving only the Twelve. Only by being with Jesus can they perform </p>
<p>the next two functions: preaching and casting out demons. ese are princi-</p>
<p>pal features of Jesus’ ministry (1:21–27, 35–39), but they are now inherited </p>
<p>by his apostles.</p>
<p>e names of the Twelve are given, with the occasional nicknaming </p>
<p>by Jesus. Mark does not explain why this is done. One theory suggests that </p>
<p>it has to do with either their character (cf. 9:38; Luke 9:54)</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>or the role</p>
<p>they would henceforth play (Matt 16:18).</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>Simon is nicknamed Peter (v.</p>
<p>16), indicating his foundational role in the early Church. James and John </p>
<p>are given the name Boanerges (v. 17). is word is usually explained as a </p>
<p>Greek transliteration of the Hebrew benê regeš or benê rōgez. ey mean </p>
<p>respectively “sons of commotion” or “sons of agitation.” However, “sons of </p>
<p>thunder” is not an impossible rendering.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ree other names deserve some discussion. e passage mentions a </p>
<p>certain James, who is the son of Alphaeus (v. 18), but no Levi, who was also </p>
<p>called the son of Alphaeus in 2:14. Even if Levi is Matthew, as the parallel </p>
<p>in Matt 9:9 tells us, it is still puzzling why this is not claried. Furthermore, </p>
<p>61. is is the case with classical Greek, although the LXX contains instances where </p>
<p>the meaning is “appointed” (1 Sam 12:6; 1 Kings 12:31; 13:33).</p>
