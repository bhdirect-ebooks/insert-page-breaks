<p>The Climax of the Gospel: </p>
<p>The Messiah and Jerusalem (11:1—16:8)</p>
<p>Challenge in Jerusalem: </p>
<p>SymbolsofFulfillmentandJudgment (11:1–26)</p>
<p>is section begins the nal part of the book of Mark. All the action takes </p>
<p>place in Jerusalem. Mark’s Gospel only narrates one journey to this city. is </p>
<p>stylized presentation serves to heighten the signicance of the city for Jesus. </p>
<p>In this city Jesus’ prophecy of his own fate comes to pass.</p>
<p>We should also note that, alongside the change of location, there is </p>
<p>also a change in prole. Everything important about Jesus’ ministry comes </p>
<p>into the open. So there is much confrontation between Jesus and the Jewish </p>
<p>authorities. Furthermore, the actions performed by Jesus are provocative, </p>
<p>challenging many accepted and hallowed notions and institutions. ey are </p>
<p>also mainly symbolic (the entry, the action in the Temple, the cursing of </p>
<p>the g tree, the last supper), and oen made without explanatory remarks. </p>
<p>Such challenging actions do not just speak of judgment, they also speak of </p>
<p>fulllment.</p>
<p>Why is there a change of prole with the change of locality? It may </p>
<p>be argued that it is related to the mystique and signicance of Jerusalem. </p>
<p>ese have been strengthened through years of traditioning, and they may </p>
<p>be known as the Zion traditions. I have attempted to map out the signi-</p>
<p>cance of these traditions in a dierent book, especially their connection to </p>
<p>eschatology, and demonstrate their appropriation by Jesus.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>All that said, what must still be pointed out is that if we accept that </p>
<p>Jesus preaches the message of the kingdom in accordance with the back-</p>
<p>ground provided by Isa 52:7, God’s reign in Zion is one theme that he can-</p>
<p>not neglect. If God is to reign in Zion, Jesus’ kingdom ministry must of </p>
<p>necessity relate to the city of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>1. Tan 1997: 23–51.</p>
