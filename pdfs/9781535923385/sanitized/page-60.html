<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>2:1—3:642</p>
<p>A second possibility is to translate the epi + genitive construction as </p>
<p>“at the time of” (i.e., construing the epi + genitive as having temporal force), </p>
<p>but to think of the title as being given prospectively.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>is will result in the</p>
<p>translation “in the days of Abiathar, who later became the high priest,” just </p>
<p>as we might say the Queen was born in such and such a time, when she </p>
<p>was not actually queen at her birth. If the objection is raised that Abiathar’s </p>
<p>name is not mentioned in the account, it may then be answered that Jews </p>
<p>remembered him better because of his connection with David and with the </p>
<p>rst Temple. All this may smack of special pleading, because if there were </p>
<p>no historical problem in the rst place, every reader would have construed </p>
<p>Mark as saying that David met Abiathar the high priest. Perhaps the best </p>
<p>that we can do now is to say the jury is still out on this question.</p>
<p>What is more important is the point of comparison that Jesus hopes to </p>
<p>make. e regulations governing the consecrated bread are found in Exod </p>
<p>25:30 and Lev 24:5–9. e point of comparison can either be that of (a) </p>
<p>human needs justify the infringement of Torah regulations;</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>or that (b) an</p>
<p>anointed royal gure has the authority to override them.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>What is common</p>
<p>to both cases is that there is precedence in Scripture for the overriding of </p>
<p>a Torah regulation. As the latter point carries an important christological </p>
<p>freight, we will explicate it further. Just as David was not condemned for </p>
<p>performing something illegal, neither should Jesus be, provided the Phari-</p>
<p>sees were willing to consider Jesus in the same category. In this light, we </p>
<p>may regard Jesus as speaking of his own special status.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>He, like David, is</p>
<p>the yet-to-be-fully recognized (i.e., enthroned) king, and can dispense with </p>
<p>a sacred regulation in order to sustain life: the life of his disciples.</p>
<p>Jesus’ pronouncement in v. 27 makes the lesson clear. It explains what </p>
<p>has priority. Some Jewish writings state a similar viewpoint (Jub. 2:17; 2 Bar. </p>
<p>14:18; b. Yoma 85b). Perhaps the most relevant is that from the Melkita on </p>
<p>Exodus 31:14: “e Sabbath is handed over to you, not you to it,” which </p>
<p>means God’s gi of the Sabbath was given not to destroy but to bring about </p>
<p>true humanity. However, this principle, while putting things in their proper </p>
<p>place, is not meant to teach that any human being can decide when sacred </p>
<p>regulations may be dispensed with. So the next pronouncement is needed </p>
<p>to complete the thought (v. 28).</p>
<p>“Man” (v. 27) and the “son of man” (v. 28) may be construed as syn-</p>
<p>onyms. But no Jew will accept that human beings in general may be the </p>
