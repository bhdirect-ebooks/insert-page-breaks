<p>Preface</p>
<p>When there are so many major commentaries on the Gospel of Mark avail-</p>
<p>able in the market, what place is there for another? is question has been </p>
<p>uppermost in my mind as I write this volume which the reader now have in </p>
<p>his/her hands.</p>
<p>Without competing with these major commentaries, I have nonethe-</p>
<p>less utilized their research ndings, and summarized them for an audience </p>
<p>which may not have the time or expertise to pore through them. Moreover, I </p>
<p>have kept in view the notion of a New Covenant Commentary Series. A new </p>
<p>covenant presupposes a previous one, I have therefore sought assiduously to </p>
<p>show how Mark is connected to the OT. Furthermore, the word covenant </p>
<p>reminds me of a community, and hence, I have written this with a view to </p>
<p>making Mark’s message applicable to the challenges of being a Christian </p>
<p>community in this complicated world. I have introduced as best as I can </p>
<p>some Asian insights—I hope this has not been too obtrusive—believing that </p>
<p>my social location may bring some benets to a worldwide audience, for </p>
<p>aer all this may very well be the reason why the editors of the series ap-</p>
<p>proached me to contribute this volume.</p>
<p>I have kept in mind that my primary task is to explain Mark’s message, </p>
<p>not to show the prehistory of his sources, or attempt to justify his point of </p>
<p>view (although I must add that at times resistance was futile). No attempt </p>
<p>is made to treat completely or eruditely every issue connected with the in-</p>
<p>terpretation of the Markan text. ere are commentaries that have taken on </p>
<p>this task, and there is no need to match their feat. Focusing on Mark’s text </p>
<p>also means I’ve given scant attention to historical issues or problems raised </p>
<p>by parallel accounts in the other Gospels. My task is to explain Mark’s tale, </p>
<p>and not to assess whether it stands up to historical or synoptic scrutiny. </p>
<p>Otherwise this commentary would have been twice as long.</p>
<p>As this is not a commentary on commentaries of Mark, certain issues </p>
<p>that have taken much space in them are sometimes given scant notice, if I </p>
<p>have judged that their resolution does not illuminate Mark’s text. On the </p>
<p>rare occasion I have struck out on my own, generating new issues and oer-</p>
<p>ing interpretations hitherto not found in other commentaries.</p>
