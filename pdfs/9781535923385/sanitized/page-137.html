<p>Excursus: e Place of Jesus’ Transguration 119</p>
<p>would brook no rivals if it were not for the sequel which speaks of Jesus’ </p>
<p>descending the mountain and meeting the scribes (9:14). Believing it is </p>
<p>quite inconceivable for scribes to be found so far from Jewish territory, other </p>
<p>scholars prefer to place the Transﬁguration within Galilee. The chief candi-</p>
<p>date, and what is traditionally recognized as the site, is Mt Tabor, 1929 feet </p>
<p>in height and about ﬁfty miles southwest of Caesarea Philippi.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> The draw-</p>
<p>back of this suggestion is that Mt Tabor is not actually high, although its </p>
<p>solitariness gives the impression it has a commanding height. Furthermore, </p>
<p>it requires quite a lot of walking from Caesarea Philippi (about ﬁfty miles </p>
<p>as the crow ﬂies). The one other possible candidate is Mt Meron, which </p>
<p>is 3962 feet in height and about twenty-ﬁve miles southwest of Caesarea </p>
<p>Philippi.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>It is close enough to Caesarea Philippi but because it is situated</p>
<p>near other mountains of roughly the same height, it does not have a com-</p>
<p>manding presence.</p>
<p>Another factor complicating the site’s identiﬁcation is that height of </p>
<p>mountains is sometimes construed theologically, in good biblical tradition </p>
<p>(i.e., a high mountain is so only because of theological signiﬁcance [cf. Isa </p>
<p>2:2]).</p>
<p>Verse 3 focuses on Jesus’ clothes, which become more dazzlingly white than </p>
<p>any process on earth could hope to match. e description of dazzlingly </p>
<p>white clothes does carry important theological implications. Heavenly be-</p>
<p>ings and saints at the eschaton shine resplendently (1 En 62:15; cf. Rev 4:4; </p>
<p>7:9). Jewish descriptions of God oen use light and whiteness to describe </p>
<p>his garments (cf. Dan 7:9). So the question for many theologians is: does the </p>
<p>Transguration point to what the saints will nally have, of which Jesus is </p>
<p>the forerunner? Or does it set Jesus apart from the rest of creation because </p>
<p>only he shares his Father’s glory?</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>e answer is probably the latter, in that</p>
<p>Mark’s story is structured to show the uniqueness of Jesus. He does not de-</p>
<p>scribe Elijah and Moses as shining in resplendent glory, although Luke did </p>
<p>in Luke 9:31.</p>
<p>As was said earlier, two visitors were present: Elijah and Moses. Much </p>
<p>has been discussed on why it is precisely these two who show up. It could be </p>
