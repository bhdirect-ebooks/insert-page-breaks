<p>Jesus’ Inaugural Message 23</p>
<p>God is the only true ruler and creator, and so his reign cannot be abstractly </p>
divorced from history. Indeed, Israel was chosen to be God’s true subjects
<p>to demonstrate concretely to the world what his reign meant. But her dis-</p>
<p>obedience sent her into exile. Consequently an eschatological expectation </p>
<p>of God’s return to Zion shows in a climactic way that he is the sole king of </p>
<p>the universe and that Israel is his special people (Ps 145:10–13; Isa 52:7). </p>
<p>While the meaning of the kingdom may indeed be polyvalent, it should not </p>
<p>therefore be conceived as referring to anything. Instead, it is to be anchored </p>
<p>in the ongoing story of the one God and his people, and understood in rela-</p>
<p>tion to the yearning for eschatological closure.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Is there an OT passage that may help us situate Jesus’ announcement? </p>
<p>Isaiah 52:7 is a good candidate. is is supported by Mark’s having named </p>
<p>Isaiah as the key inspiration behind his idea of the beginning of the gospel </p>
<p>in 1:2–3. Furthermore, the notions of God’s reign and the proclamation of </p>
<p>good news are explicitly joined together in Isa 52:7. In this passage, God </p>
<p>returns to Zion to reign as king. Consequently, the herald announces to </p>
Zion and the cities around her the good news. is divine advent signies
<p>for the Israelites the end of exile and the onset of eschatological blessings. </p>
<p>Jesus’ message of the kingdom may be said to relate to such a hope.</p>
<p>e puzzling thing is that the kingdom is described as “having come </p>
<p>near,” which contradicts on the surface the fact of fulllment. Not surpris-</p>
<p>ingly, scholars have debated the precise meaning of the original Greek, </p>
<p>whether ēngiken means imminence</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> or arrival.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>e consensus is that it</p>
<p>means imminence, but this does not bring us any closer to a resolution </p>
<p>of the apparent contradiction. at said, this phenomenon of the “now-</p>
<p>and-not-yet” actually forms the substructure of much of Markan theology, </p>
<p>indicating that Mark sees in it a potent theological theme. Indeed, as his </p>
<p>narrative progresses, the reader will see that the resolution of this oxymoron </p>
<p>lies in answering correctly the question of who Jesus is, and how the king-</p>
<p>dom is intimately bound up with him. In this regard, “paradox” is a better </p>
<p>word than “contradiction” (i.e., the kingdom is in a sense still future but in </p>
<p>an important sense it may be claimed to have arrived).</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>We will return to</p>
<p>this topic in our treatment of chapter 4.</p>
<p>e response counselled by Jesus is repentance and faith. While such </p>
<p>qualities have an important role in general piety, their special connection </p>
