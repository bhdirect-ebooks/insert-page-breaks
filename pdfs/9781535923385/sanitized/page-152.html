<p>school and the ruminations of Josephus (Life of Josephus 426; Antiquities </p>
<p>4:253). e upshot of this emphasis on the oneness lays the foundation for </p>
<p>a permanent union, which is grounded in creation itself (i.e., God made </p>
<p>humanity male and female). Since this is a union of two, and not the absorp-</p>
<p>tion of one into the other, both partners stand equal in the eyes of God in </p>
<p>the marital relationship.</p>
<p>Looking back at the whole discussion, we can see how wise Jesus’ an-</p>
<p>swer is: it gives nothing incriminating away, and does not compromise the </p>
<p>pure intention behind the institution of marriage. e point is that to start </p>
with casuistry (i.e., what cases may be deemed legal for divorce proceedings
<p>to take place), is to start at the wrong end. e right way to start is to ask </p>
what really is the divine intention behind marriage, what this intention is
<p>supposed to signify, and to reect on how such an intention may be en-</p>
<p>couraged to ourish in all our laws and institutions. is is something that </p>
<p>Antipas in all his power, and Herodias in all her cunning, would not dare </p>
<p>contradict. Nor would the Pharisees dare to do so in front of the crowds.</p>
<p>Something more potent is also perhaps being hinted. If Moses gave </p>
<p>the concession because of hard-heartedness, what would happen if this </p>
<p>hard-heartedness is taken away? If the coming of the reign of God means </p>
<p>restoration of people and creation, what ethics should be practiced once this </p>
<p>restoration is at work? Jesus has proclaimed that the kingdom is dawning </p>
<p>in and through his ministry. is means he is the one who can remove the </p>
<p>hardness of hearts. If this is so, the attitude of his disciples towards mar-</p>
riage and divorce should be transformed. So the kingdom connection must
<p>be kept in mind. Not surprisingly, the parallel story in Matthew contains a </p>
<p>discussion between Jesus and his disciples on how this original intention </p>
<p>relates to the kingdom (Matt 19:10–12).</p>
<p>e suggestion made above may explain why the implications of his </p>
<p>discussion with the Pharisees are made clear only to the disciples in a house </p>
<p>(v. 11). ey are “the insiders” in relation to kingdom realities. is motif </p>
<p>has been encountered before in Mark’s Gospel. Special teachings reserved </p>
<p>for the disciples are taught in the house (cf. 7:17; 9:28, 33), without specify-</p>
<p>ing whose house it is.</p>
<p>at Jesus’ teaching in v. 12 is revolutionary may be seen in the fol-</p>
<p>lowing: both genders are covered, and that remarriage means committing </p>
<p>adultery. e patriarchy of Jewish society, sponsored by texts such as Lev </p>
<p>20:10–12, easily led women to be regarded as chattels. Hence, they are never </p>
<p>the oended party in any breakdown of marital relationships. is means </p>
<p>men do not commit adultery against women, but only against other men </p>
<p>(i.e., if a married man slept with the wife of his neighbor, he did not sin </p>
<p>against his own wife but only against his male neighbor). Similarly, if a </p>
