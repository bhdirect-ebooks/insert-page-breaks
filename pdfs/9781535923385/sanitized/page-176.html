<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>11:1–26158</p>
<p>has to be such that what it stands for harmonizes with the coming of the </p>
<p>eschaton. But it fails abjectly at the most critical hour. Instead of being the </p>
<p>house of prayer, drawing in the nations to worship God, it has become a den </p>
<p>of robbers. What then would happen to it? e sequel which completes the </p>
<p>Markan narrative sandwich explains.</p>
<p>e Withered Tree (11:20–26)</p>
<p>e next morning Jesus and the Twelve observe the g tree has withered </p>
<p>from the roots. e words of Peter serve as a reminder that it is so because </p>
<p>of Jesus’ curse (v. 21). In other words, Mark reiterates that this g tree has </p>
<p>been cursed by Jesus.</p>
<p>e response of Jesus to Peter’s remark at rst glance is puzzling but </p>
<p>when it is connected to the Temple incident, the trend of thought becomes </p>
<p>transparent. e rst statement has to do with faith (v. 22),</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>and we have</p>
<p>seen how important this is in Jesus’ ministry. It is that which draws upon </p>
<p>the gracious power of the in-breaking kingdom. But v. 23 connects this faith </p>
<p>to the moving of a particular mountain,</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>and not just any other mountain.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind Jesus’ location, the mountain in question can either be the </p>
<p>Mount of Olives, or the mountain on which the Temple is situated. Taking </p>
<p>the cue from the Markan sandwich, it is best then to interpret “this moun-</p>
<p>tain” as referring to the Temple mount. So Jesus is saying, if there is faith, the </p>
<p>Temple mount may be cast into the sea.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>If the Temple becomes obsolete when there is faith, how does one ap-</p>
<p>proach God to make requests and oer sacrice for atonement of sins? is </p>
<p>implicit question is picked up in vv. 24–25. Verse 24 pronounces that the </p>
<p>Temple is not needed for requests to be heard by God.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>In fact when prayers</p>
<p>are made in faith, even when that important national institution is removed, </p>
<p>those prayers will still be heard and answered. Similarly in v. 25, forgive-</p>
<p>ness comes not through oering sacrices at the Temple in Jerusalem, but </p>
<p>may come through prayer and forgiveness exercised on others. So by faith, </p>
<p>28. e Greek actually says “have faith of God” (echete pistin theou). e genitive </p>
<p>theou (i.e., “of God”) can be construed in many ways. In this context the viable pos-</p>
<p>sibilities are “have faith in God” or “have the kind of faith that God gives.” Whatever </p>
<p>the case is, faith is now pitted against the Temple. In this context, it forms a new badge </p>
<p>of identity for God’s people. What marks them out is no longer their devotion to the </p>
<p>Temple but the faith they have in God or from God (or both).</p>
<p>29. is is clear in the Greek text: tō orei toutō.</p>
<p>30. Marshall 1989: 168–69.</p>
<p>31. Recently Gray 2008: 53–55 draws upon Moloney 2002: 227–28 and argues that </p>
<p>behind these sayings stand the notion of a new Temple.</p>
