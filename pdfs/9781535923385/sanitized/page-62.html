<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>2:1—3:644</p>
<p>know better, and should know better, being religious leaders (3:5). e </p>
<p>prophets’ audience were Torah breakers but Jesus’ audience are supposedly </p>
<p>Torah upholders. All the poignant lessons of the exile appeared to have an </p>
<p>opposite eect on those who lead.</p>
<p>It is astonishing that the Pharisees and the Herodians can collude to-</p>
<p>gether (v. 6), but nothing brings enemies together like having a common </p>
<p>archenemy. e term “Herodians” denotes probably not a religious sect but </p>
<p>the supporters of the ruling dynasty of Herod</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> (cf. War 1:319, where a simi-</p>
<p>lar term is used), which was not Jewish but Idumean, and was in place only </p>
<p>because of Rome. is was a dynasty which was resisted by the Pharisees (cf. </p>
<p>Josephus Antiquities 17:41–47; War 1:571). </p>
<p>Mark’s Achievement with this Cycle of Stories </p>
<p>Within a short span of narrative, Mark succeeds in showing what the key </p>
<p>issues between Jesus and the religious authorities are, and what the central </p>
<p>reason behind them all is. is will prepare Mark’s readers for the rest of his </p>
<p>Gospel, where resistance will be evident and culminates with the crucixion </p>
<p>of Jesus. So a pale shadow has fallen over Jesus’ ministry. All is not well, even </p>
<p>when stupendous deeds of healing and restoration are performed. Why? </p>
<p>Mark reminds his listeners that it is due to a hardness of heart, the same </p>
<p>condition which led to Pharaoh’s destruction and Israel’s exile, a theme that </p>
<p>will be picked up again in chapter 4.</p>
<p>We must not forget, however, that all this actually serves as a foil to </p>
<p>a more important theme at work—Jesus’ identity. He performs deeds that </p>
<p>put him on the side of the one God of Israel. e use of the Son of Man </p>
<p>designation exhibits this phenomenon. Introduced for the rst time in the </p>
<p>rst controversy story, and repeated again in the fourth, it resonates with </p>
<p>prerogatives that are uniquely God’s. In this light, all the controversies boil </p>
<p>down to the question of who Jesus is, and what he claims to be doing in </p>
<p>relation to Israel’s covenantal story.</p>
<p>Summary of Jesus’ Deeds (3:7–12)</p>
<p>is Markan summary presents Jesus’ typical activities (teaching and mi-</p>
<p>raculous deeds), the typical venue (by the lake, oen on a boat), and the </p>
<p>typical responses (of crowds and demons). While performing a transitional </p>
<p>function,</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>it also carries the plot forward. Verse 7 speaks of a withdrawal</p>
