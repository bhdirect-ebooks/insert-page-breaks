<p>e Gospel in Action and Typical Activities of Jesus’ Ministry 29</p>
<p>portraying the spread of Jesus ministry. At the same time he explains what </p>
<p>this ministry is all about: not self-aggrandizement (we will see later how im-</p>
<p>portant such a theme is to Mark), but the propagating of the gospel of God.</p>
<p>Healing of the Leper (1:40–45)</p>
<p>With this story Mark hints at the religious ramications of Jesus’ ministry, </p>
<p>especially his healings, and how these may lead to conict with the religious </p>
<p>authorities.</p>
<p>What is known as leprosy in the Bible is not Hansen’s disease. Instead </p>
<p>the term is used to refer to a variety of skin diseases. Leviticus 13:45–46 </p>
<p>shows the lengths to which someone aicted with it has to go to avoid con-</p>
<p>taminating others: he had to wear torn clothes, leave his hair unkempt, wear </p>
<p>a mask to cover the lower part of his face, and cry out, “Unclean! Unclean!” </p>
<p>in order to ward people o. He also had to live in colonies, separated from </p>
<p>society. More burdensome was the religious meaning of such a dreaded </p>
<p>disease. It was regarded as incurable, being a result of God’s judgment (see </p>
<p>Num 12:9–15; 2 Chron 26:16–21; cf. also the telling remark in 2 Kings 5:7). </p>
<p>Such a person could not appear before God in the Temple. With this back-</p>
<p>ground, we can understand the desperation that drove the leper to meet </p>
<p>Jesus and thus violate some social customs. Instead of standing afar and </p>
<p>calling to Jesus, this leper goes to him, falls poignantly on his knees and </p>
<p>beseeches Jesus to heal him (v. 40).</p>
<p>Jesus shows his compassion (see excursus) and does the surprising </p>
<p>thing by touching him, thus breaking a taboo. Moreover, Jesus declares him </p>
<p>clean. To show the ecacy of Jesus’ declaration, Mark uses his favorite word </p>
<p>“immediately.” If Jesus can declare someone clean, what becomes the role </p>
<p>of the priest, since in the OT he is the only one who can pronounce a leper </p>
<p>clean (Lev 13:2–6)? With this, we come to the ominous note in vv. 43–44.</p>
<p>Excursus: Was Jesus Incensed or Compassionate?</p>
<p>The attitude of Jesus towards this breaking of an important social cus-</p>
<p>tom is occluded by a textual uncertainty: whether Jesus was incensed or </p>
<p>compassionate (v. 41). Many commentators choose to follow the reading </p>
<p>orgistheis,</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>found in manuscript D (Codex Bezae) and supported by some</p>
<p>11. is means “being incensed.” See France 2002: 115; Guelich 1989: 72; Marcus </p>
<p>2000: 206; for a contrary view, see Collins 2007: 177, 179; Gundry 1993: 95; Metzger </p>
<p>1994: 76.</p>
