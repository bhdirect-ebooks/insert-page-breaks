<p>2:1—3:636</p>
<p>(2) that he may have in mind the gure of Dan 7:13 as the exposition of </p>
<p>the meaning of his ministry; (3) that such a term does not automatically </p>
<p>convey the above idea, as the ordinary usage may refer to man in general; </p>
<p>(4) that Jesus sees t to remain ambiguous for important reasons; (5) that </p>
<p>he sometimes also pours in new content to the meaning of the phrase such </p>
<p>that even the usage of Dan 7:13–14 cannot fully explain it; and (6) that </p>
<p>there is a profound convergence between his kingdom message and his </p>
<p>self-understanding, because in both instances, hiddenness/ambiguity is a </p>
<p>characteristic which could only be penetrated by faith. is is precisely how </p>
<p>Mark presents Jesus, and it will be demonstrated as his narrative progresses.</p>
<p>To be sure, Dan 7:13–14 does not mention the authority to forgive </p>
<p>sins. However, since the Son of Man is the gure who brings an end to the </p>
<p>dominions of the world and unleashes the eschatological age, it is not dif-</p>
<p>cult to extend this further to suppose he may be connected with the recon-</p>
<p>ciliation between God and his people, a concept within which forgiveness </p>
<p>is to be understood.</p>
<p>Without allowing the details to cloud the main point, we may say this </p>
<p>controversy story highlights a major aspect of Jesus’ work: the forgiveness </p>
<p>of sins. What has troubled Israel throughout her checkered history, namely </p>
<p>the problem of sin, may potentially be resolved by Jesus. at said, we must </p>
<p>not miss how the story is presented. Some scribes perceive Jesus’ actions as </p>
<p>arrogating to himself the unique prerogative of God. ere is no attempt </p>
<p>on the part of Jesus either to clarify this or to avoid being misunderstood. </p>
<p>Every dutiful Jew would have the obligation to do so when it concerns so </p>
<p>important a tenet of the community as the Shema. Instead, Jesus provokes </p>
<p>the scribes further by claiming to have the authority, as the Son of Man, to </p>
<p>forgive sins, and backs it up with healing. e exclamation of the crowd </p>
<p>serves, then, to highlight Jesus’ uniqueness (v. 12). So an implicit question </p>
<p>is raised. It is not about Jesus’ status vis-à-vis the Temple. Instead, it is about </p>
<p>his claims and the one God confessed in Israel’s Shema.</p>
<p>primary linguistic function is to refer [to Jesus], not to characterize . . . it is the sentence/</p>
<p>saying that conveys the intended claim or statement, not the son of man’s expression it-</p>
<p>self.” is is brilliantly put but we would like to add that the expression was not plucked </p>
<p>out of thin air, meaning it was used because it could potentially carry a profound freight </p>
<p>that was bequeathed by tradition. In other words, saying “e Son of Man is so-and-so” </p>
<p>conveys more signicance to the community than saying “Jesus is (or I am) so-and-so.” </p>
<p>is being the case, the referential directions run in both ways: Daniel 7 and Jesus of </p>
<p>Nazareth. e phenomenon shows creativity at work, a creativity that is consistent with </p>
<p>the type that surrounds also Jesus’ kingdom message. All this means the tradition is </p>
<p>mined for creative speech and act, which in turn breathes new life into the tradition.</p>
