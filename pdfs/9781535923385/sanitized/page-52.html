<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>2:1—3:634</p>
<p>context, the primary body of learning was the Torah, and hence, scribes in </p>
<p>Mark’s Gospel were people who knew and taught the Torah.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>From their</p>
<p>point of view, only God can forgive sins.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>So they criticize Jesus inwardly:</p>
<p>“He’s blaspheming” (v. 7). To be sure, the priest has been given the role to </p>
<p>pronounce God’s forgiveness through the rituals of the Temple. But it is </p>
<p>unlikely Jesus is challenging the Temple here.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>In fact, as the dri of the</p>
<p>narrative indicates, Jesus’ pronouncement is deemed to have arrogated to </p>
<p>himself the sole prerogative of God.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>Blasphemy in the OT is a capital oense (Lev 24:10–16). Although </p>
<p>there was no technical denition of what constituted blasphemy in Jesus’ </p>
<p>day, the extant Jewish evidence connects it to speaking against God, pro-</p>
<p>nouncing his unique name or claiming the unique prerogatives of God (m. </p>
<p>Sanh. 7:5).</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>Forgiveness of sins is one such prerogative (Exod 34:6–7; Isa</p>
<p>43:25; 44:22). is is reinforced continually through the annual Yom Kippur </p>
<p>festival. However, there may be one instance where forgiveness of sins is at-</p>
<p>tributed to a human being. In a fragment from the Qumran caves (4Q242), </p>
it is said that a Jewish diviner (or exorcist?) forgave Nabonidus’s sin. Because
<p>of its fragmentary nature, its meaning remains highly debated.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> Alterna-</p>
<p>tively, this fragment may be regarded as the exception that proves the rule. </p>
<p>All this means the religious leaders’ response in Mark is historically credible.</p>
<p>Mark’s phrase ei mē heis ho theos (v. 7) should be translated “except </p>
<p>‘God is one’.” is clumsy construction serves to make reference to the She-</p>
<p>ma (Deut 6:4–5), which functions somewhat like a Jewish creed. e Shema </p>
<p>confesses that for Israel there is only one God, and she is to love this one God </p>
<p>with her entire being.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>From the way the Markan narrative is set up, Jesus’</p>
<p>claim is interpreted by the scribes to have transgressed the sacred bound-</p>
<p>aries of their confession of one God. Jesus is therefore regarded as having </p>
<p>put himself in an equal position with that one God. e Shema, therefore, </p>
<p>should be the frame of reference for understanding this controversy.</p>
<p>Jesus’ reply to the scribe’s unspoken accusation (v. 9) has puzzled many </p>
<p>readers. It is oen assumed Jesus wants to demonstrate that it is easier to talk </p>

27. is implies we are not taking the verb of v. 5 as a “divine passive.” Jesus then
<p>becomes the one who oers forgiveness. See France 2002: 125–26; cf. the ne study of </p>
<p>Hous 1994: 125–43.</p>
