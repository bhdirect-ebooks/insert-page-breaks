<p>On the Road to Jerusalem</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>10:32–45142</p>
<p>why the glorious Son of Man must suer. It has to do with service and pro-</p>
<p>viding a ransom.</p>
<p>e ird Passion Prediction (10:32–34)</p>
<p>e story begins with the description of the group being “on the way” (v. </p>
<p>32). We have pointed put earlier that this is a cipher for the way of Jesus, </p>
<p>which is also the way of discipleship. In this passage the destination of this </p>
<p>way is given: Jerusalem. It is in Jerusalem that the disciples will come to </p>
<p>understand exactly the way of Jesus, and what following him means. And </p>
<p>sadly, in Jerusalem their failure will be seen in all its lurid colors. Mark sows </p>
<p>here the seed of his Gospel’s denouement.</p>
<p>Something ominous is in the air, judging by the description of the as-</p>
<p>tonishment and fear of the disciples and other followers. is is construed </p>
<p>as being connected with Jesus’ “leading the way.” e reaction of the Twelve </p>
<p>and other followers indicate it must be something about Jesus’ manner that </p>
<p>causes such consternation. Rightly, many commentators conclude it is Je-</p>
<p>sus’ resolute march.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>All this gives this third and nal Passion Prediction a</p>
<p>climactic quality.</p>
<p>e taking aside of the Twelve (v. 33) signies yet again the privileged </p>
<p>position these have in terms of revelation. Details of Jesus’ forthcoming </p>
<p>ill-treatment are given: being mocked, spat at, ogged, and nally killed. </p>
<p>Such items are also connected with the Suering Servant of Isaiah 53 (es-</p>
<p>pecially vv. 3, 5, 8–9, 12). Furthermore, the Gentiles are now mentioned </p>
<p>as the executioners, although the Jewish leaders (the chief priests and the </p>
<p>scribes) engineer this. e prediction of resurrection aer three days ends </p>
<p>the saying.</p>
<p>e Request of James and John (10:35–40)</p>
<p>James and John approach Jesus with a request that has, as its credit, bold-</p>
<p>ness, but as its debit, rank self-centeredness (v. 35). It should also be noted </p>
<p>that such a request is not incredible, as these two have seen Jesus transg-</p>
<p>ured. Perhaps they sense that Jerusalem will be the climax of Jesus’ ministry, </p>
<p>and hope that when this happens they will be seen as his faithful lieutenants, </p>
<p>deserving to share his glory. at said, the request also reveals that the les-</p>
<p>son on true greatness, rst taught in 9:33–37, has not been imbibed.</p>
<p>50. France 2002: 41 Marcus 2009: 744 argues that the language speaks of pilgrim-</p>
<p>age, which has been fused with the idiom of holy war of Deutero-Isaiah. Cf. Watts 1997.</p>
