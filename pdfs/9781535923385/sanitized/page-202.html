<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>13:1–37184</p>
<p>erful intervention is either preceded or is accompanied by such heavenly </p>
<p>phenomena. One conrmation of this view comes from Jewish writings, </p>
<p>especially the apocalyptic type (TMos 10:1–5; SibOr 3:796–803), and also </p>
<p>other OT passages such as Ezek 32:7 and Joel 2:10, where clearly such </p>
<p>celestial phenomena are linked with God’s taking powerful action, rather </p>
<p>than the destruction of cities per se. Hence, we may conclude that these </p>
<p>phrases are better understood as stock imagery accompanying or preceding </p>
<p>a theophany. Of course, the astonishing thing here is that these passages </p>
<p>refer to a Christophany.</p>
<p>is paves the way for us to construe the event as the Parousia of the </p>
<p>Son of Man. Nevertheless, the Parousia and the destruction of the Temple </p>
<p>are conceptually connected in that both express the idea of the vindication </p>
<p>of Jesus of Nazareth as God’s Messiah and the Son of Man. Incidentally, if </p>
<p>vv. 24–27 contain coded language for the destruction of the Temple, it will </p>
<p>give the discourse a substantial element of incongruence, because it means </p>
<p>the Temple is destroyed aer the tribulation (v. 24). Most Jews would regard </p>
<p>its destruction as preceding or a part of that tribulation. Indeed, the end of </p>
<p>tribulation should logically mean salvation.</p>
<p>ere is one more issue to tackle, and this concerns the “movement” </p>
<p>of the Son of Man (v. 26). e Greek word erchomai can mean coming or </p>
<p>going. So some scholars argue it should be translated as “going to,” in line </p>
<p>with the original context of Dan 7:13, from which such words are taken. </p>
<p>Accordingly, the discourse speaks of the Son of Man’s going to the Ancient </p>
<p>of Days to receive power and authority, which signies the vindication of </p>
<p>the Son of Man, seen concretely in the destruction of the Temple.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>is an attractive explanation and might be adopted if not for the diculties </p>
<p>pointed out earlier. It may be better to regard such language as speaking of a </p>
<p>“coming to,” since early Jewish interpretation of this Danielic text interprets </p>
<p>it in the way that speaks of the Son of Man coming to earth to judge (4 Ezra </p>
<p>13.3; cf. b. Sanh. 98a).</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>In other words, the Jewish logic in such writings</p>
<p>may be that even if the Son of Man did go to the Ancient of Days to receive </p>
<p>authority and power, it is done so that he could come to earth to deliver </p>
<p>his beleaguered people. And his coming will be with the clouds of heaven, </p>
<p>full of power and glory. Furthermore, the next verse (v. 27) which speaks </p>
<p>of the Son of Man sending his angels to gather his elect may support our </p>
<p>contention in that the only other occurrence in Mark that associates the Son </p>
<p>of Man with angels is Mark 8:38, which refers to the Parousia. Hence, the </p>
<p>event envisaged in 13:27 should be identical, and that “angels” in this pas-</p>
