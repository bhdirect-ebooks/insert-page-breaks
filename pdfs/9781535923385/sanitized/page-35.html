<p>John the Baptist and Jesus’ Ministry 17</p>
<p>John the Baptist and Jesus’ Ministry (1:2–13)</p>
<p>If the gospel is fundamentally connected with Jesus Christ, its origins actu-</p>
<p>ally predate his ministry and reach back to the Old Testament. Mark cites </p>
<p>a fused text from Exod 23:30; Isa 40:3; and Mal 3:1 but attributes it only </p>
<p>to Isaiah (v. 2). Sensing that there is an apparent contradiction here, later </p>
<p>scribes changed the reading to “the prophets.” However, the early manu-</p>
<p>scripts should be followed and there is no need to think that Mark has </p>
<p>blundered. ree reasons may be posited for this “limited” attribution. First, </p>
<p>Mark is in good company, as many biblical writers understood prophecy as </p>
<p>being related to the one ongoing story of God and Israel, or the world.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>it is oen assumed there is a theological force driving forward and unify-</p>
<p>ing history. Earlier Scripture may then be regarded as contributing to the </p>
development of the same divine plot as later scripture, giving rise to the
<p>Jewish exegetical practice of linking texts containing similar subject matter </p>
<p>(known in its Jewish form as gezerah shawah or analogy). Secondly, Mark </p>
<p>singles out Isaiah because he regards him as the best exponent of the evan-</p>
<p>gelical message of the Old Testament (i.e., Isaiah is the prophet of the gospel </p>
<p>par excellence). What this implies is that we are given a hint as to how we </p>
<p>may understand Mark’s concept of the gospel, and from this, the ministry of </p>
<p>Jesus may therefore be better understood.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> Indeed, Isaiah is the only writ-</p>
<p>ing prophet mentioned by name in Mark’s Gospel. irdly, Mark wants to </p>
<p>introduce John the Baptist as the predicted forerunner of Jesus Christ. John’s </p>
<p>role dovetails best with the Isaianic prophecy of the voice in the wilderness. </p>
<p>e citation of Isa 40:3 therefore prepares the reader for the next narrative </p>
<p>development: a description of John’s ministry.</p>
<p>e use of Isa 40:3 is highly signicant here. e Qumran community </p>
<p>which produced the Dead Sea Scrolls, appropriated it to explain its estab-</p>
<p>lishment in the wilderness (1QS 8:14; 9:19–21). It was there to prepare the </p>
way of God, signifying the imminent fulllment of the great divine promise
<p>of restoration. e focus on this is not surprising, as Isaiah contains the </p>
<p>powerful theme of a second exodus and a return of God to Zion to reign. </p>
<p>When this is realized, there will be profound transformation in both ora </p>
<p>and fauna, to the extent that the term “new creation” may be used (cf. Isa </p>
<p>65:17). In Mark’s hand, the same prophecy is used for signaling the immi-</p>
nence of divine restoration, but astonishingly he explicates it as the coming
<p>of Jesus Christ.e signicance of this will be made clear as Mark’s narra-</p>
<p>tive progresses.</p>
<p>13. See the treatments of this fascinating topic in Beale 1999; and Fishbane 1985.</p>
<p>14. Cf. Boring 2006: 36: “Mark writes an ‘Isaian story’.”</p>
