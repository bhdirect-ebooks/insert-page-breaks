<p>Mission Furthered and Martyrdom Foreshadowed 77</p>
<p>Secondly, there must have been some sort of “family resemblance” be-</p>
<p>tween the ministry of Jesus and his disciples and that of John the Baptist to </p>
<p>warrant the remark that the latter has been raised from the dead. Verse 14 </p>
<p>suggests the two may be associated via powerful deeds. Unfortunately there </p>
<p>is no record of John ever performing a miracle (cf. John 10:41). at said, </p>
<p>the verse may simply mean John has become more powerful aer he has </p>
<p>been, presumably, raised from the dead. All this dovetails with the opening </p>
<p>verses of Mark, where John’s ministry is described as the beginning of the </p>
<p>gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>irdly, this particular detail is given to pave the way for a ashback </p>
<p>that explains how John the Baptist came to be imprisoned and executed. </p>
<p>is is one loose thread that was le hanging aer 1:14, which Mark now </p>
<p>ties up.</p>
<p>Some other popular responses are given in v. 15: Elijah or one of the </p>
<p>prophets. is is the rst time Elijah is mentioned in Mark’s Gospel; Jesus </p>
<p>will be associated with Elijah again in 8:28. is name also appears in the </p>
<p>account of the Transguration (9:4–5), and the dialogue between Jesus and </p>
<p>his disciples that follows. In that dialogue, John the Baptist is regarded as </p>
<p>Elijah (9:11–13). ere was great expectation among the Jews for the return </p>
<p>of Elijah (cf. Mal 4:5–6) to herald the eschaton.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>e statement about Jesus’ being “a prophet or one of the prophets” </p>
<p>shows that in popular thought there are at least two kinds of prophets: a </p>
<p>general one and a classical one. e NIV attempts to make this distinction </p>
<p>even clearer with the phrase “of long ago,” but it is not found in the Greek </p>
<p>text. e classical ones were deemed pre-eminent, as they were OT person-</p>
<p>ages who were reformers and doers of mighty deeds. e line of classical </p>
<p>prophets was thought to have ceased until the great day of restoration (cf. 1 </p>
<p>Macc 4:46; 14:41).</p>
<p>Flashback: John’s Death (6:17–29)</p>
<p>is ashback provides the circumstances leading to John’s arrest and his </p>
<p>subsequent death. John was arrested for criticizing Herod’s marriage to </p>
<p>Herodias, the wife of his half-brother, Herod Philip (not Philip the tetrarch). </p>
<p>ere is a parallel account in Josephus (Antiquities 118:116–19) and much </p>
<p>has been discussed about the supposed discrepancies between the accounts. </p>
<p>ey revolve around three issues: (i) the reason for John’s arrest; (ii) the </p>
<p>location of his prison; and (iii) the name of Herodias’s previous husband. As </p>
<p>interesting as this discussion may be, our interest is in Mark, and the issue </p>
<p>132. Cf. Collins 2007: 304.</p>
