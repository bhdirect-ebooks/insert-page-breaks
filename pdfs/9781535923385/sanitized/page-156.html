<p>On the Road to Jerusalem</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>10:1–31138</p>
<p>the rationale for these demands, and love can be incisive. More importantly, </p>
<p>the radical demands of Jesus show that the end of keeping the command-</p>
<p>ments is not philanthropy, as important as this may be, but following him </p>
<p>(cf. 8:34–38).Perhaps all this is actually the working out of what the tenth </p>
<p>commandment “You shall not covet” means. If this is the case, we can now </p>
<p>appreciate why Jesus did not mention this commandment earlier. is is the </p>
<p>commandment to emphasize, not by quoting but by discussing its implica-</p>
<p>tions. But all this the man cannot do. He has kept some commandments but </p>
<p>his failure to give up his possessions to follow Jesus shows his loyalty is not </p>
<p>really to the commandments but to his own opulent welfare. For him, obey-</p>
<p>ing God’s commandments may be done as long as one’s preferred lifestyle is </p>
<p>not compromised.</p>
<p>We are now in a position to understand why Jesus starts by radical-</p>
<p>izing the concept of goodness. Far from being a non sequitur, it actually </p>
<p>establishes the framework for understanding the apparently harsh require-</p>
<p>ment Jesus makes in v. 21. Jesus is not countering attery here. Instead, he </p>
<p>sees the need to emphasize the fundamental axiom for Jews in order that </p>
<p>the discussion may move forward fruitfully. God is good such that goodness </p>
<p>cannot be predicated of anyone except God himself! Remembering this will </p>
<p>help the rich young man understand that the dicult tenth commandment </p>
<p>is given not to make him miserable but to liberate him to be a good neigh-</p>
<p>bor to those in need, and to follow the Messiah when he summons him. </p>
<p>Conversely, the failure to give up all to follow the summons of God made </p>
<p>through his Messiah will reveal that he has not authentically armed the </p>
<p>goodness of God.</p>
<p>We can now appreciate certain curious aspects of the story, especially </p>
<p>why the rst four commandments were not cited. If they were, the man </p>
<p>would certainly have replied that he had no other gods. But now that he </p>
<p>is shown to be unable to give up all to obey the tenth commandment and </p>
<p>follow the Messiah, he has been unmasked as one who cannot authentically </p>
<p>confess the Shema (i.e., he does have other gods).</p>
<p>e sad pronouncement of Jesus in v. 23 is greeted with amazement </p>
<p>on the part of the disciples. is is so because there is one powerful strand </p>
<p>of Jewish thought that connects wealth with God’s favor.</p>

<p>Along with some </p>
<p>passages in the Bible (e.g., Deut 28:1–14; Job 1:10; Ps 128:1–2), which speak </p>
<p>of God rewarding the wise and faithful with riches, there are other passages </p>
<p>in Jewish literature of the Second Temple Period that speak of the rich as </p>
<p>being the blessed of God. It is probably this latter concept that leads the </p>
<p>disciples to remark: “Who then can be saved?” In other words, if those who </p>
<p>are tangibly blessed by God cannot enter the kingdom, those who appear to </p>
