<p>John the Baptist and Jesus’ Ministry 19</p>
<p>may be regarded as “baptism.” e similar saying in Matt 3:11||Luke 3:16 </p>
<p>adds the word “re.” is may gel with what Mark is portraying, as re is </p>
<p>also an image for cleansing, albeit with the added notion of judgment.</p>
<p>Mark skillfully follows his description of John’s message with the pub-</p>
<p>lic appearance of Jesus. Astonishingly, Jesus comes to be baptized by John! </p>
<p>is may reduce Jesus’ status to being ordinary, but Mark prevents this by </p>
describing the divine portent that takes place at Jesus’ baptism: the heavens are rent open, the Spirit descends in the form of a dove, and the divine voice
<p>speaks, arming Jesus to be his beloved son. e signicance of all this may </p>
<p>be unpacked as follows.</p>
<p>First, Mark uses the Greekschizōto describe what took place in the </p>
<p>heavens. is is a graphic word, which speaks of “tearing asunder.” Mark </p>
<p>uses this word only once more, in the account of the tearing of the Temple </p>
<p>veil (15:38). e other Gospel writers use anoigō, which means “open,” so </p>
<p>as to avoid suggesting violence was done to heaven (Matt 3:16; Luke 3:21). </p>
<p>Mark knows the meaning of anoigō and uses it in 7:35. All this implies schizō </p>
<p>is being used intentionally and not because Mark lacks the vocabulary. e </p>
<p>reason for this may be that Mark is thinking of Isaiah. is suggestion is </p>
<p>supported by the fact that the book of Isaiah is important to the composi-</p>
<p>tion of Mark’s Gospel. In Isa 64:1 the prophet pleads before God to rend</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> </p>
<p>the heavens and come down, so as to restore the nation of Israel. For Mark, </p>
<p>Jesus’ baptism signies God has answered this prayer.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>e long-awaited</p>
<p>intimate involvement and restorative action of God has come to pass.</p>
<p>Secondly, the descent of the Spirit takes on the bodily form of a </p>
<p>dove.e Greek syntax</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>can mean either “the Spirit, appearing as a dove,</p>
<p>descends” (i.e., understanding it adjectivally)</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>or “the Spirit descends as a</p>
<p>dove does” (i.e., understanding it adverbially).</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Since Mark describes Jesus</p>
<p>as seeing something tangible, many commentators take the simile as adjec-</p>
<p>tival.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>e image of the Spirit as a dove is remarkable in two ways. First, </p>
<p>the description is a stable datum across all four Gospels, when they contain </p>
<p>many variations in the accounts of Jesus’ baptism. e second is that this </p>
<p>is a unique description of the Spirit, not even paralleled in the account of </p>
<p>Pentecost (Acts 2:1–4). Against all comers, this image of the Spirit has stuck </p>
<p>in Christian art, but what does it mean?</p>
<p>16. e LXX uses anoigō, but the MT uses qāra‘, which means “tear open.”</p>
