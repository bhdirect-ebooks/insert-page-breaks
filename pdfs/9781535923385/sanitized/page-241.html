<p>e Resurrection of Jesus 223</p>
<p>If what we have argued above is correct, we are driven to only one </p>
<p>conclusion: either Mark could not complete his Gospel because of extenuat-</p>
<p>ing circumstances, or that the original ending was lost at an early stage.</p>
<p>222</p>
<p>Is</p>
<p>there any way whereby we can reconstruct this ending? Some scholars think </p>
<p>this can be done.</p>
<p>223</p>
<p>If it is true that Matthew and Luke have used Mark, it</p>
<p>can then be conjectured that the similar elements between Matthew’s and </p>
<p>Luke’s resurrection accounts would most probably be from Mark, especially </p>
<p>since Q (or the common material that Matthew and Luke have that is not </p>
<p>found in Mark) probably did not contain the Passion narrative and Resur-</p>
<p>rection narrative.</p>
<p>Furthermore, much of Matthew’s resurrection account in the rst </p>
<p>seven verses follows Mark’s closely. It may then be conjectured, based on </p>
Matthew’s penchant for following Mark and diverging only when certain
<p>Matthean motifs are being eshed out, that Mark’s resurrection account </p>
<p>would most probably contain the story of the women’s report to the dis-</p>
<p>ciples, Jesus’ meeting up with the disciples again, and probably a sort of </p>
<p>commissioning, where the disciples’ role is once again rearmed.</p>
<p>e Empty Tomb (16:1–5)</p>
<p>e resurrection story of Mark, as we have it, focuses on two motifs: the </p>
<p>discovery of the empty tomb by three women, and the report of the young </p>
<p>man, which explains what has happened and commissions them to do what </p>
<p>is necessary.</p>
<p>Mark has cleverly set the stage for the resurrection story by informing </p>
<p>his audience in 15:40 of the presence of three special women: Mary Mag-</p>
<p>dalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome. Since Jesus was buried hur-</p>
<p>riedly and without proper embalming, these three women wanted to make </p>
<p>up for this lack at the earliest opportunity, on the rst sunrise of the week, </p>
<p>straight aer the Sabbath (i.e., early Sunday morning [vv. 1–2]). e ques-</p>
<p>tion occupying the thoughts of these women concerns the stone that seals </p>
<p>the entrance of the tomb. ere may be a touch of humor here: shouldn’t </p>
<p>the women have thought of this before they set o?</p>
<p>224</p>
<p>Or could it be that</p>
<p>there was no male disciple they could turn to because they had all gone into </p>
<p>more in terms of contents and plot.</p>
<p>222. is was the dominant theory up till the middle of the twentieth century, be-</p>
<p>fore the rise of post-modernism.</p>
