<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>16:1–8224</p>
<p>hiding?</p>
<p>225</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, when they “look up,” they see that the</p>
<p>large stone has already been rolled away. e Greek for the phrase “looked </p>
<p>up” (anablepō) plays an interesting role in Mark’s Gospel. It can mean “look-</p>
<p>ing upwards” (6:41; 7:34) or a restoration of sight (8:24; 10:51–52). e lat-</p>
<p>ter may be alluded here.</p>
<p>226</p>
<p>When they could see properly, they would see</p>
<p>that the obstacle was gone.</p>
<p>Upon entering the tomb they see a young man, dressed in white and </p>
<p>sitting on the right side. e description of this young man is done to in-</p>
<p>dicate his signicance. White robes are associated with festivities such as </p>
<p>weddings. e dress of those participating in heavenly worship in Jewish </p>
<p>apocalyptic literature is also white (cf. Rev 7:9, 13). More importantly, white </p>
<p>is also oen the color of the clothing of heavenly beings (cf. Dan 7:9; 1 En. </p>
<p>62:15–16; 87:2). In addition, being seated on the right side conveys the no-</p>
<p>tion of pre-eminence and authority (Ps 110:1). e combined eect is that </p>
<p>this person has the authority to break the news to the women. He cannot be </p>
<p>any ordinary man, and certainly not the young man of 14:51–52.</p>
<p>227</p>
<p>He should</p>
<p>be regarded as an angel sent from God (cf. Matt 28:2, 5; Luke 24:4–5).</p>
<p>228</p>
<p>Mark also tells us that the women are alarmed. is is the expected be-</p>
<p>havior of human beings when they are confronted with the supernatural or </p>
<p>things beyond their comprehension. Many times in the Gospel the disciples </p>
<p>have evinced such behavior, but the injunction of Jesus to them is that they </p>
<p>should not be afraid but have faith in him. A similar message, as we shall </p>
<p>see, is also given to the women.</p>
<p>e Commissioning Explanation (16:6–8)</p>
<p>e words of the young man both explain what is happening and commis-</p>
<p>sion the women to do the necessary. In fact, they summarize concisely the </p>
<p>key themes of the resurrection story: (i) the encouragement to be unafraid; </p>
<p>(ii) the loving rebuke that the women’s assumptions are wrong because they </p>
<p>expected to see a dead Jesus; (iii) Jesus is risen; (iv) the evidence for this </p>
<p>is present; (v) resurrection speaks of Jesus’ vindication, indicating also the </p>
<p>trustworthiness of Jesus’ words; and (vi) Jesus will restore and lead his dis-</p>
<p>ciples. We will expand on some of these points below.</p>
<p>225. is means the women’s question amounts to being a lament. See Marcus </p>
<p>2009: 1079–80.</p>
<p>226. Mann 1986: 664–65.</p>
<p>227. Collins 2007: 795, provides a good refutation of the idea.</p>
