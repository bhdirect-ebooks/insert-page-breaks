<p>and Jewish authorities are on their toes. Moreover, since any action taken </p>
<p>against a popular person when the city is thronged is politically risky, the </p>
<p>chief priests and the scribes judge it is better to have Jesus arrested aer the </p>
<p>festival (v. 2).</p>
<p>Against this plot is set the story of the anointing of Jesus by an un-</p>
<p>named woman in the home of Simon the leper at Bethany. Mark tells his </p>
<p>audience that the ointment used is expensive (v. 3), as it is worth a year’s </p>
<p>wages (v. 5). So this draws the comment from those present that what is </p>
<p>done is sheer wastage (v. 4). e statement “It could have been sold … and </p>
<p>the money given to the poor” (v. 5) is intended to heighten the wrongness </p>
<p>of the action because during Passover the poor are to be specially remem-</p>
<p>bered. e ointment in question is pure</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> spikenard, oen used for anoint-</p>
<p>ing specially-honored guests or the dead, especially when they are held in </p>
<p>high regard.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>e woman’s action of breaking the container speaks of a</p>
<p>deliberate intent to use it all, without holding back.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>e deeper signicance of her action is lost to those around Jesus. </p>
<p>So they focus on what is most tangible: the exhausting of a year’s wages in </p>
<p>one proigate act. Mark describes her being rebuked harshly with the same </p>
<p>word used for Jesus’ rebuke of demons.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>In her defense Jesus extols her</p>
<p>act, and makes essentially three points. First, she has performed a good or </p>
<p>beautiful work for him. roughout Mark’s Gospel it is Jesus who performs </p>
<p>good work on people. Not once do people perform work on Jesus. is act </p>
<p>of the woman breaks the pattern. At the narrative level, Mark’s audience can </p>
<p>see that her work stands in stark contrast to that of the authorities and Judas, </p>
<p>which frame her action.</p>
<p>Secondly, her act recognizes that Jesus is to be held in higher regard </p>
<p>than the poor. Certainly giving to the poor is emphasized in Mark’s Gospel </p>
<p>(10:21), but this must be done out of a commitment to Jesus. e poor will </p>
<p>always be with them, but not Jesus. ere will always be opportunity to give </p>
<p>to the poor, but the signicant moment must be grasped: Jesus will be going </p>
<p>to the cross soon.</p>

<p>121. It has oen been misunderstood that the container is made in such a way that </p>
<p>it must be broken in order to use the spikenard, but there is absolutely no evidence for </p>
<p>this. Instead, the following assumption is more cogent: as the spikenard is expensive, it </p>
<p>would have been stored in containers that are stoppered, so that the unused contents </p>
<p>would not be wasted. See Marcus 2009: 934; Gundry 1993: 802, 813.</p>
