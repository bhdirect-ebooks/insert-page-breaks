<p>Challenge in Jerusalem: SymbolsofFulllmentandJudgment 155</p>
<p>dierent types of coins were used throughout the Empire, some with a better </p>
<p>quality of metal than others, it is hardly surprising the Temple authorities </p>
<p>should insist on a particular coinage. In this instance, it is only the Tyrian </p>
<p>silver statēr that is accepted.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>If this is so, money-changing facilities should</p>
<p>be provided, and so they were. e dove-sellers supplied sacricial victims </p>
<p>for the poor. e richer might bring bulls and lambs, but for the poor that </p>
<p>was the one sacricial victim they might use. Moreover, many other sac-</p>
<p>rices to be made were related to doves, as commanded in the Torah (Lev </p>
<p>12:6; 15:14, 29; Num 6:10).</p>
<p>In the light of all these data, Jesus’ action becomes transparent. Either </p>
<p>he is attacking all these “services” as an extremist who does not think of </p>
<p>practicalities, or he is attacking something fundamentally more important. </p>
<p>Was he against the whole idea of sacrice?</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>If this were so, it would be</p>
<p>strange for him to take it out on the buyers and sellers. It would be better to </p>
<p>stage the action where sacrices were being made. So we need an alternative </p>
<p>interpretation.</p>
<p>ere is good and varied evidence to show there was corruption aris-</p>
<p>ing from the provision of such services.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>is need not be surprising as any</p>
<p>enterprise, however good its intention at the outset, may be easily corrupted </p>
<p>by the love for money. If this evidence is considered seriously, Jesus may </p>
<p>then be construed as staging a prophetic demonstration against the ongo-</p>
<p>ing corruption. Such corruption harnesses the monopolistic power that the </p>
<p>Temple authorities enjoy. ey approve sacricial victims, and they also </p>
<p>provide them, albeit oen through intermediaries. All this dovetails with </p>
<p>the words of Jer 7:11, cited by Jesus. e Temple authorities have re-enacted </p>
<p>the role of the generation before the exile, in that they do violence and rob </p>
<p>with impunity and retreat, like bandits, to the safe haven of their robbers’ </p>
<p>cave, which in this context is the Temple. In so doing, the Temple becomes </p>
<p>not a place for worship but a place for violent robbery. e money changers </p>
<p>are singled out probably because Jesus does not believe in the mandatory </p>
<p>collection of the Temple Tax (see Matt 17:24–27).</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>e dove sellers are also</p>
<p>the special targets of his action because they supply sacricial animals for </p>
<p>the poor. ere is an anecdote in the rabbinic literature (m. Ker 5:7) that has </p>
<p>relevance for our understanding of the signicance of this action of Jesus. </p>
<p>e prices of doves were exorbitant, therefore making it dicult for the </p>
<p>poor to oer sacrices to God. Gamaliel I, a prominent rabbi, made a pro-</p>
