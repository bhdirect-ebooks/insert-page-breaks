<p>More Revolutionary Values for Disciples 139</p>
<p>be ill-favored do not stand a chance. at said, it must also be pointed out </p>
<p>that an opposite strand of Jewish thought also existed, where wealth was </p>
<p>regarded as something that alienated a person from God.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>Jesus’ pronouncement challenges the notion just described. Because </p>
<p>of its importantance, Jesus answers the disciples’ amazement with a reit-</p>
<p>eration of what he said earlier: it is hard for the rich to enter the kingdom </p>
<p>(vv. 23–24). is diculty may be compared with a camel going through a </p>
<p>needle’s eye. ere is a long-standing tradition that speaks of a small gate in </p>
<p>Jerusalem by the name of “Needle” which camels must stoop to get through. </p>
<p>is is then used to convey the concept of humility. As beautiful as this may </p>
<p>be as an image, there is no such gate.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>What Jesus uses here is a common</p>
<p>proverb or an epigram to convey the message of impossibility. A parallel to </p>
<p>this may be found in the Babylonian Talmud (b. Ber. 55b), where the image </p>
<p>of an elephant going through the eye of a needle is used.</p>
<p>e perplexity of the disciples increases so that they remark, “Who </p>
<p>then can be saved?” e answer given by Jesus brings his disciples back to </p>
<p>the platform of hope: with men it may be impossible but with God all things </p>
<p>are possible (v. 27). ose who are seemingly the ill-favored of God may be </p>
<p>saved. Indeed, the saying probably also opens up the possibility to the rich: </p>
<p>they may also be saved by the wonder-working power of God, certainly not </p>
<p>by allowing them to cling on to their riches, but by opening their eyes to see </p>
<p>their dependence on God.</p>
<p>At this juncture Peter reminds Jesus that the disciples actually have le </p>
<p>everything to follow him (v. 28). is becomes the foil to the next piece of </p>
<p>teaching, which gives closure to the whole concept of giving up everything </p>
<p>to follow the Messiah. It is that following the Messiah is not about impov-</p>
<p>erishment. Instead, it means ordering one’s values rightly. e items listed </p>
<p>by Jesus (v. 29) may be considered as life’s essentials in the rst century </p>
<p>Palestinian context: home, relations, and means of survival. Indeed, these </p>
<p>were understood to be the blessings of the covenant (progeny and land as </p>
<p>inheritance; cf. Gen 12:1–3). e giving up of all this for the kingdom re-</p>
<p>sults paradoxically in gaining them (v. 30), which echoes 8:35. Persecutions </p>
<p>are mentioned, as not all will imbibe kingdom values. But the essential point </p>
<p>is that giving up is not impoverishment but being free in order to share; such </p>
<p>sharing enlarges one’s home, family, and possessions. is thought connects </p>
<p>us back to Jesus’ radical demand in v. 21. We can now see the cohesiveness </p>
<p>of the whole passage.</p>

<p>49. Aquinas mentioned it is from Anselm that he learned it, in Catena Aurea on </p>
<p>Matthew 19: 23–26.</p>
