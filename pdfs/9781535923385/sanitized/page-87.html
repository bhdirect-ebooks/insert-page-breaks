<p>Jairus’s Daughter and the Woman with Chronic Bleeding 69</p>
<p>Being Jesus’ social superior, and given the fact that Jesus has been re-</p>
<p>jected by the religious authorities, it would have been very humbling for </p>
<p>Jairus to approach him for help. However, Jairus does precisely this because </p>
<p>of his daughter’s plight (vv. 22–23). Perhaps we may discern here the humil-</p>
<p>ity of faith. Without humility, faith cannot germinate.</p>
<p>One interesting Greek word used to describe Jairus’s request in v. 23 is </p>
<p>sōthē, which means “be saved.” While being appropriate for the situation of </p>
<p>Jairus’s daughter, it also serves as a link-word with the story of the woman </p>
<p>with a menstrual problem (see vv. 28, 34). Moreover, the sōzō word creates </p>
<p>special resonances for the Markan audience, as salvation comes through </p>
<p>faith in Jesus.</p>
<p>Mark tells us that Jesus accepts his plea for help and goes with him. </p>
<p>e seemingly innocuous detail about a larger crowd following them (v. 24) </p>
<p>prepares the audience for the sandwiched story.</p>
<p>e Power of Faith: the Healing of the Woman with Chronic Bleeding </p>
<p>(5:25–34)</p>
<p>Mark informs his audience that in the crowd there is a woman who has </p>
<p>suered from a menstrual disorder for twelve years. According to the Torah, </p>
<p>menstruation rendered a woman ritually impure (Lev 15:19–33). So con-</p>
<p>cerned were the Jews to avoid being ritually contaminated by menstruants </p>
<p>that a whole tractate was devoted to it in the Mishnah (tractate Niddah). </p>
<p>ere is also evidence, albeit in the third to fourth centuries, for the Jewish </p>
<p>notion that a menstruant could also neutralize a healer’s power (Hekhalot </p>
<p>Rabbati 18). If this notion has roots reaching back many centuries earlier, </p>
<p>Jewish listeners to Mark’s tale would have certainly caught a deeper sig-</p>
<p>nicance: Jesus should not have been able to heal the woman. e datum </p>
<p>“twelve years” emphasizes how longstanding the problem has been. All av-</p>
<p>enues of healing known to her have been tried, and all resources exhausted, </p>
only to receive the dividend of a worse condition (vv. 25–26). Such a poi-
<p>gnant description prepares the way for Mark’s audience to appreciate how </p>
<p>astonishing her eventual healing was.</p>
<p>e woman’s action indicates she wants to touch Jesus’ robe surrepti-</p>
<p>tiously, not wishing for attention (vv. 27–28). is is because in the Jewish </p>
<p>context, this woman is regarded as chronically impure, and whatever she </p>
<p>touches will be impure too. For her then to be present in a crowd is al-</p>
<p>ready scandalous, not to mention touching a holy healer. Her action, while </p>
<p>scandalous, actually sets the stage for a powerful theological theme to be </p>
<p>disclosed.</p>
