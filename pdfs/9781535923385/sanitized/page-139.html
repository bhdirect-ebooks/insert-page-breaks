<p>Transguration and Transformation of Expectations 121</p>
precursor to the giving of divine oracles (Exod 19:19; 40:35; Num 9:18–23;
<p>Job 38:1; Ezek 1:4). For the second but nal time in Mark (cf. 1:10–11), the </p>
divine voice arms Jesus’ status as the Son of God. Signicantly, this time
<p>around, the words are directed not at Jesus but at the disciples. ey hear </p>
<p>for the rst time the unmediated voice of God, arming the status of Jesus </p>
<p>as the unique Son and the one to whom they must listen. e word “listen” </p>
<p>plays a critical role in Mark’s Gospel (cf. 4:3, 9, 24; 7:14; 8:18).</p>
<p>We note too that this command is placed at a strategic point. Jesus has </p>
<p>been teaching the reality of the kingdom in unprecedented and shocking </p>
<p>ways. Not only that, but his perspective on what the Messiah is to do, and </p>
<p>what the glorious Son of Man is to experience at the hands of mortal men, </p>
is scandalous. But the divine voice commands that only Jesus be heard, vin-
<p>dicating thus his perspective.</p>
<p>Some scholars have been impressed with the many allusions the </p>
<p>Transguration story has with the receiving of Torah by Moses on Mt. Si-</p>
<p>nai.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>e following are possible parallels: (1) the time note of “aer 6 days”</p>
<p>(Exod 24:16; Mark 9:2); (2) the presence of companions (Exod 24:1, 9; Mark </p>
9:2); (3) the cloud that covers (Exod 24:16; Mark 9:7); (4) the divine voice
<p>(Exod 24:16; Mark 9:7); (5) a transformed appearance (Exod 34:30; Mark </p>
<p>9:3); and (6) the reaction of fear (Exod 34:30; Mark 9:6). How much should </p>
<p>be made of this, Mark does not tell us. But if this is latent in Mark’s story, we </p>
<p>may safely say that just as Moses spoke God’s will to his people, so also does </p>
<p>Jesus, but in a way that is climactic. And just as Moses received a theophany </p>
<p>(a visible manifestation of the presence of God), so also do the disciples re-</p>
<p>ceive a Christophany (a visible manifestation of Jesus’ glory). All this serves </p>
<p>to bolster the importance of Jesus.</p>
<p>e Son of Man and Elijah (9:9–13)</p>
<p>As Jesus descends the mountain with his disciples, he charges (the Greek </p>
<p>is diastellomai, which means “sternly warns”) his disciples to keep what </p>
<p>they have experienced quiet. is pattern of great revelation to be followed </p>
<p>by secrecy has been encountered many times previously. But what is sig-</p>
<p>nicantly dierent here is the time limit to this secrecy: until the Son of </p>
<p>Man has risen from the dead. is implies that Jesus’ resurrection, which of </p>
<p>course entails his prior crucixion, serves as an important hermeneutical </p>
<p>lens. It is through this event that the glorious deeds of Jesus’ ministry may </p>
<p>be understood correctly. Of course, this will also ensure that fanatical mes-</p>
<p>sianic enthusiasm is forestalled until all things are made clear. Why is the </p>
<p>28. Marcus 2009: 1114–18.</p>
