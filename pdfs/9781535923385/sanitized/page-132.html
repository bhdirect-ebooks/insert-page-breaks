<p>On the Road to Jerusalem</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>8:31—9:1114</p>
<p>Plain as it may be, it is still shocking and challenges received notions of </p>
<p>messiahship. Consequently, Peter responds negatively and a dialogue with </p>
<p>Jesus ensues (vv. 32b-33). Peter rebukes Jesus and is, in turn, rebuked by him </p>
<p>with stinging words. In Peter’s mind, the Messiah does not suer. Indeed, </p>
<p>the predominant assumption is that a Messiah who suers and dies shows </p>
<p>himself only to be a false claimant. Hence, Peter seeks to set his teacher </p>
<p>straight, basing himself on solid tradition. We have here a stful of ironies! </p>
<p>e disciple rebukes the master. e disciple seeks to instruct the master. </p>
<p>He gets the plain message of Jesus right (i.e., Jesus will die), but he also gets </p>
<p>it all wrong. In so doing, the chief disciple plays out the role of Jesus’ chief </p>
<p>enemy (Satan)!</p>
<p>Peter is typed as a “satan” in Jesus’ rebuke, not because he was demon-</p>
<p>possessed but because in opposing Jesus’ intention to go to Jerusalem to be </p>
<p>repudiated and executed, he has played out the role of Satan, the one who </p>
<p>opposes God’s purposes. e nal sentence of v. 33 makes this clear: Peter </p>
<p>minds the things of men and not the things of God. e fact that “Jesus </p>
<p>turned and looked at his disciples” (v. 33) suggests that Jesus’ harsh words to </p>
<p>Peter may be intended to prevent the other disciples from imbibing Peter’s </p>
<p>viewpoint.</p>
<p>e Greek phrase hypage opisō mou is highly interesting, as it may be </p>
<p>understood as a Semitic idiom for commanding someone to get out of sight, </p>
<p>or get back in line (i.e., get back to discipleship principles). A similar phrase, </p>
<p>deute opisō mou, is used in 1:17, where Jesus summoned his disciples, espe-</p>
<p>cially Peter, to follow him. Hence, Jesus is not saying “get lost” to Peter but </p>
<p>“get back in line.”</p>
<p>Following the Suering Messiah (8:34—9:1)</p>
<p>e scene now changes, although the theme continues. Jesus calls the </p>
<p>crowd. He explains to them what being his disciple means. It does indeed </p>
<p>entail recognizing Jesus to be the Messiah and the Son of Man. But such </p>
<p>recognition must be followed by the kind of praxis described in this passage. </p>
<p>We will attempt to expound this in greater detail.</p>
<p>e Greek phrases that speak about following Jesus at the beginning </p>
<p>and the end of the saying in v. 34 form an inclusio or brackets (opisō mou </p>
<p>akolouthein and akoloutheitē moi). What is framed is explained by these </p>
<p>brackets, the content of which are painful but practicable actions. Being </p>
<p>thus framed means such actions are taken not to show heroism but princi-</p>
<p>pally to follow Jesus.</p>
