<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>15:21–41212</p>
<p>we have myrrh. Although Pliny informs us that wine mixed with myrrh </p>
<p>is a luxury drink (Natural History14:15, 92–93), the army physician Di-</p>
<p>oscorides Pedanius of the rst century attests to myrrh’s having narcotic </p>
<p>properties (Materia Medica 1:64:3). It is this property which induces the </p>
<p>unnamed people to oer Jesus the drink.However, Jesus refuses to accept it, </p>
<p>probably because he must drink to the full the cup the Father has reserved </p>
<p>for him.</p>
<p>Aer furnishing his audience with the setting of the crucixion, Mark </p>
<p>now focuses on the cross, oering many details. Some of them bear great </p>
<p>signicance. e rst is that the crucixion takes place at the third hour (v. </p>
<p>25). According to the Jewish reckoning of time, the third hour is roughly </p>
<p>ournine o’clockin the morning. Innocuous as this may seem, the detail has </p>
<p>actually generated scholarly discussion because the parallel in John speaks </p>
<p>of the sixth hour instead (John19:14). Since this is a commentary on Mark </p>
<p>and not a work on Gospel harmony, it shall stay focused on Mark’s tale (but </p>
<p>see the excursus for some proposed solutions).</p>
<p>Excursus: Mark and John on the Hour of Cruciﬁxion</p>
<p>Mark’s time note occasions difﬁculty only when it is compared with the </p>
<p>parallel provided by John, as the latter puts it at “about the sixth hour” </p>
<p>(John 19:14). The major proposals for solving this discrepancy are: (i) to </p>
<p>regard Mark 15:25 as an insertion by scribes during the earliest phase of </p>
<p>the transmission of Mark’s Gospel. This explains why although it is not </p>
<p>part of the original text, there is currently no textual variants that indicate </p>
<p>otherwise;</p>
<p>191</p>
<p>(ii) to regard Mark 15:25 as being theologically motivated in</p>
<p>that Mark wants to align the time of Jesus’ death with the daily sacriﬁce (the </p>
<p>Tamid);</p>
<p>192</p>
<p>(iii) to regard John’s account as theologically motivated in that</p>
<p>he wants to align the time of Jesus’ death with the sacriﬁce of the Passover </p>
<p>lambs;</p>
<p>193</p>
<p>and (iv) to treat both time notes as approximations arising from</p>
<p>observing the position of the sun.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p>The jury is still out on this issue. That</p>
<p>said, it must be emphasized that Mark’s chronology is coherent: the trial </p>
<p>before Pilate takes place “very early in the morning” (the Greek here is pro¯i), </p>
