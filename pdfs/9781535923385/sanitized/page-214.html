<p>e Climax of the Gospel Mark 14:1—15:47196</p>
<p>tance of this, we must think of two parallel stories which are intertwined: </p>
<p>the story of the Exodus and the story of Jesus. e Passover meal reminds </p>
<p>the Jews of the deliverance from Egypt and the covenant at Mt Sinai that </p>
<p>ensued. In the establishment of this covenant, the blood of an animal was </p>
<p>shed. Hence, when Jesus identies the cup as his blood of the covenant, he </p>
<p>seeks to communicate two propositions. e rst is that his ministry and </p>
<p>death are connected intimately with Israel’s covenant with God. Far from </p>
<p>being a religious deviant, Jesus is actually a faithful Israelite. However, if the </p>
<p>blood of the Sinaitic covenant has already been shed, why does blood need </p>
<p>to be shed again? is brings us to the second proposition. What Moses </p>
<p>originally ratied is no longer tenable, otherwise there would be no need </p>
<p>for further blood to be shed. In other words, what Jesus is oering is either </p>
<p>a renewal of the covenant, or a new covenant altogether.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>Prophets such</p>
<p>as Jeremiah and Isaiah looked forward to a time when the intransigence of </p>
<p>Israel would be eradicated, leading to the fulllment of the true intent of the </p>
<p>Sinaitic covenant (e.g., Isa 59:15–21; Jer 31:31–34). Jesus is then conveying </p>
<p>that what the Prophets looked for is now being fullled. e new people </p>
<p>to be brought about once this new or eternal covenant is established are </p>
<p>represented by those partaking of the meal with Jesus. e upshot of all this </p>
<p>is that the open-ended covenantal story of Israel and God is completed by </p>
<p>Jesus’ oering of his life. e new locus of covenant identity is no longer to </p>
<p>be found in Moses but in Jesus. is does not mean what Moses ratied was </p>
<p>an evil to be done away with. Rather it means that covenant had an in-built </p>
<p>obsolescence. It awaited a completion from outside of itself.</p>
<p>e phrase “poured out for many” probably recalls Isa 53:12, which </p>
<p>speaks of the Servant pouring out his life for many.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>e “many” here is</p>
<p>not intended to limit the scope of Jesus’ death, to make it short of being </p>
<p>universal. Instead, it appropriates a biblical idiom to speak about Jesus’ re-</p>
<p>demptive death for others, without dening its scope.</p>
<p>Verse 25 speaks of Jesus’ expectation of drinking wine again with </p>
<p>the disciples in a new setting: when the kingdom of God is consummated. </p>
<p>Drinking wine is oen a metaphor associated with the in-breaking of God’s </p>
<p>earlier work I argue that this dierence in terminology is insignicant, since Jewish </p>
<p>theology did not strive for terminological precision (Tan 1997: 215–16). What is sig-</p>
<p>nicant is the juxtaposing of Jesus’ story with the covenant story, a story that many Jews </p>
<p>believe awaits completion.</p>
<p>141. On the consistent overlap of the two concepts in Jewish thought, see Nicholson </p>
<p>1986: 3–117; Tan 1997: 205–16.</p>
<p>142. Note the candid observation of Jeremias 1971–72: 203: “Without Isa 53 the </p>
<p>eucharistic words would remain incomprehensible.”</p>
