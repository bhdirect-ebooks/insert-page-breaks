<p>Improper Table Fellowship (2:13–17)</p>
<p>From the theme of the Son of Man’s authority to forgive sins, Mark moves </p>
<p>on to show how Jesus receives sinners, especially the tax collectors. is </p>
<p>controversy story contains no miracles, and it is oen known as a pro-</p>
<p>nouncement story because the main point of the story is found in the pro-</p>
<p>nouncement given at the end.</p>
<p>Since Galilee was ruled by a client king supported by Rome, the toll </p>
<p>envisaged here must have been collected for Herod Antipas’s government. </p>
<p>is toll is not to be equated with the poll tax (cf. 12:13–17) or land tax </p>
<p>which was paid directly to Rome and collected by royal ocials in the case </p>
<p>of Galilee. Rather, the toll was levied on goods or for the right of passage.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As the Sea of Galilee was teeming with sh, Levi’s toll collection probably </p>
<p>came mainly from the shing trade. e collection of these indirect taxes </p>
<p>was farmed out to the highest bidder, and such privatization oen resulted </p>
<p>in overcharging: to cover possible future losses, to receive remuneration for </p>
<p>enterprise, or simply because of greed. In the Talmud, toll-collectors are </p>
<p>lumped together with murderers and robbers (m. Ned. 3:4). Moreover, their </p>
<p>frequent contacts with the Gentiles exposed them to ritual delement (so </p>
<p>m. Tohar. 7:6), and their work, which helped support the conqueror, earned </p>
<p>them the label of quislings. Hence, Jesus’ calling a toll collector to follow </p>
<p>him is highly signicant.</p>
<p>Levi’s prompt response (v. 14) recalls that of Jesus’ rst disciples in </p>
<p>1:16–20. Based on the parallel in Matt 9:9, it is oen concluded that Levi is </p>
<p>Matthew, who is also mentioned in the list of apostles in Mark 3:18 (cf. Matt </p>
<p>10:3, where Matthew is called a toll collector in the list).</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>A meal ensues and two things may be said about it. First, the venue is </p>
<p>ambiguous (v. 15). e Greek en tē oikia could refer either to Jesus’ house </p>
<p>or to Levi’s house. Since Luke 5:29 tells us it is Levi who prepares the feast, </p>
<p>the latter is to be preferred. Secondly, this is not an ordinary meal because </p>
<p>of the posture adopted. e Greek word katakeimai means to recline. is </p>
<p>posture is adopted among Jews only for feasts or formal celebrations, such </p>
<p>as the Passover.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> Otherwise they sit for meals.</p>
<p>e scribes belonging to the Pharisaic party (see excursus) have ques-</p>
<p>tions over Jesus’ dining with toll collectors and sinners (v. 16), presumably </p>
<p>because such people were not scrupulous about ritual purity, or many other </p>
<p>regulations of the Torah. Moreover, to eat with someone in ancient times </p>
