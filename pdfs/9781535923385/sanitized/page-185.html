<p>repeat of conditions that are now obtaining in the world. Instead, it is about </p>
<p>a new order, brought about by the power of God. People will be like the </p>
<p>angels in heaven, and therefore will not marry.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>So the question of whose</p>
<p>wife that woman in the story will be does not arise at all.</p>
<p>Next, Jesus has to demonstrate that, far from contradicting Torah, res-</p>
<p>urrection is actually taught in the Mosaic corpus. e logic of Jesus’ choice </p>
<p>(Exod 3:6) is not clear, but it is certainly a passage that is fundamental for </p>
<p>Israel’s self-understanding. e revelation of God at the burning bush kick-</p>
<p>started a series of events that nally resulted in the Exodus and this, in turn, </p>
<p>led to the covenant-making at Sinai. In speculating on the underlying logic </p>
<p>of Jesus’ scriptural exposition, we bear in mind three points: the signicance </p>
<p>of the patriarchs, the concept of community embedded in the covenant, and </p>
<p>the character of God.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>First, the point of the long string of titles that introduces the God of </p>
<p>Israel is that he remains the God of those patriarchs still. is demonstrates </p>
<p>the latter’s signicance in the birth of the nation and that God chooses and </p>
<p>saves the nation because of them. A crass formula may be introduced here </p>
<p>for clarity: no patriarchs, no Exodus, no covenant, and hence, no Israel! is </p>
<p>being the case, it elicits an implicit question: “If there is a new order, will </p>
<p>these signicant founding fathers lose out on its blessings?”</p>
<p>Secondly, there is a profound corporate dimension to the covenant. In </p>
<p>Jesus’ view, this community stretches across time. So God’s titling of himself </p>
<p>in his speech to Moses mentions these patriarchs not only because they are </p>
<p>foundational personages of the nation, but also because they are somehow </p>
<p>part of the covenant community. e question that is thus engendered is: </p>
<p>“When the climax of the covenant story comes, is it only for the fortunate </p>
<p>few who live in the last days?”</p>
<p>irdly, God may be regarded by denition as the God of the living, </p>
<p>because he does not want to be known as the God of the dead. If he is God </p>
<p>only of the dead, he is no God at all, but simply an eternal being, existing all </p>
<p>by himself. Since human existence must be embodied existence, their being </p>
<p>alive with God must mean they will also be embodied one day. When God </p>
<p>introduced himself to Moses the way he did, he was not reminiscing on a </p>
<p>glorious past, but explaining the kind of God he is. is is also what we nd </p>
<p>in 4 Macc 7:18–19; 16:25, where it is armed that the patriarchs “do not die </p>
<p>to God, but live to God.”</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>58. is can mean either resurrection humans will be celibates or that gender is no </p>
<p>longer a characteristic. Whatever view is taken does not aect Jesus’ point materially.</p>
<p>59. I am aware I am developing something novel here.</p>
