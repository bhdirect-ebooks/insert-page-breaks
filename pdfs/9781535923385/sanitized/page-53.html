<p>(i.e., to pronounce forgiveness of sins) than to act (i.e., perform a healing),</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> </p>
<p>but is there more than meets the eye? Furthermore, it is puzzling that Jesus </p>
<p>would seek to demonstrate his authority to forgive by healing, since the abil-</p>
<p>ity to work miracles was not understood as proving that one possessed the </p>
<p>special prerogative of God. As the narrative plays itself out, Jesus does not </p>
<p>answer which is easier, but proceeds to demonstrate his authority by healing. </p>
<p>Perhaps the way forward is to think of Jesus as conveying the notion that </p>
<p>the healing and the oer of forgiveness are regarded as closely integrated, </p>
<p>and not dichotomized. Both are beyond human ability, and come only as a </p>
<p>gracious gi from God. is falls in line with much prophetic expectation, </p>
<p>where the concept of eschatological shalom involves both reconciliation </p>
<p>and renewal (Jer 33:6–9; Hos 2:16–23). But for those who have eyes only for </p>
<p>the tangible, the healing will speak to them.</p>
<p>ere is also an implicit challenge to the scribes’ theological under-</p>
<p>standing. If Jesus has indeed blasphemed by usurping God’s authority, how </p>
<p>could he have healed, since God is presumably the one behind the healing?</p>
<p>e phrase “Son of Man” is used in Mark’s Gospel for the rst time in v. </p>
<p>10. Much has been discussed about this title;</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>we oer here just a summary</p>
<p>of the key proposals, and indicate the stance taken.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>is phrase has been</p>
<p>understood as a circumlocution for “I,” as referring to generic man or to </p>
<p>an indenite man, or even to a special class of men. It has also been under-</p>
<p>stood as a messianic title. e view adopted here is that in its Aramaic form </p>
<p>it can refer to man in general. In Dan 7:13, however, the phrase (without </p>
<p>the article) is used poetically to contrast the beasts representing the earthly </p>
<p>empires with the human gure that stands for God’s purpose and kingdom. </p>
<p>Because of the importance of the book of Daniel in Jewish speculation on </p>
<p>the end time, this literary gure is oen utilized to speak of the climax of </p>
<p>the kingdom story and the deliverance of God’s beleaguered people. In fact </p>
<p>in the Similitudes of Enoch (1 En 37–71, dating unsure)</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>and 4 Ezra (post</p>
<p>AD 70), this gure is regarded as the Messiah. What all this means is that </p>
<p>Dan 7:13 becomes the seedbed for the understanding of the role of the Son </p>
<p>of Man in some circles, and may thus add new possibilities to an ordinary </p>
<p>phrase.</p>
<p>With this serving as background, we can then argue: (1) that Jesus </p>
<p>uses this designation to refer to himself (always with the denite article);</p>
