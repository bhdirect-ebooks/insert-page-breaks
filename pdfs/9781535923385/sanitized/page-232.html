<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>15:21–41214</p>
<p>leaders also taunt Jesus to save himself, but express the irony that the one </p>
<p>who could save others cannot even save himself.ere may also be an in-</p>
<p>tended pun, as the name “Jesus” means “Yahweh saves.” Whatever the case, </p>
<p>it is highly plausible that Mark intends a profound irony: Jesus cannot save </p>
<p>himself not because of impotence, but because of a greater salvic work he </p>
<p>is accomplishing.</p>
<p>Sadly, those who are crucied with him also insult him.All this can </p>
<p>only mean that the chosen one of God is totally rejected: by common peo-</p>
<p>ple, by leaders and even by those condemned to suer the same fate. Jesus is </p>
<p>a lonely gure: everywhere he turns he sees only taunting faces. In this sense </p>
<p>Jesus has truly become the stone that the builders reject (12:10). Moreover, </p>
<p>what he asked of his disciples he himself has accomplished: taking up the </p>
<p>cross, denying himself, and suering betrayal and rejection for the gospel’s </p>
<p>sake (8:34–35).</p>
<p>e Death of Jesus (15:33–37)</p>
<p>Up to this stage in the procession and the crucixion, the Markan Jesus has </p>
<p>not uttered a word. In fact, attention has been focused on those around him: </p>
<p>the soldiers, the crowd, the Jewish leaders, and even those who are crucied </p>
<p>alongside him. However, in this passage poignant and signicant words will </p>
<p>issue from his lips. And what theological reection and debates these words </p>
<p>have generated!</p>
<p>However, Mark rst informs us of a supernatural event—an unnatural </p>
<p>darkness—from the sixth to the ninth hour (i.e., during the brightest part </p>
<p>of the day). Its signicance is probably to be gathered from the OT, where </p>
darkness over the land during the day is a sign of divine displeasure or judg-
<p>ment (Deut 28:29; Amos 8:9; Jer 15:9). To our loss, Mark does not clarify </p>
whether the divine wrath is directed against Jesus or the conspirators.
<p>At the ninth hour, probably towards the end of the darkness, Jesus </p>
<p>cries out in Aramaic, which Mark translates as “My God, my God, why have </p>
<p>you forsaken me?” e cry of dereliction and god-forsakenness has engen-</p>
<p>dered much theological reection in later Christian tradition.</p>
<p>197</p>
<p> Not sur-</p>
<p>prisingly, there is a textual variant in the manuscript tradition which reads </p>
<p>instead: “My God, my God, why have you heaped insults (the Greek here </p>
<p>is ōneudisas) upon me?” (D, h century). is is probably because some </p>
<p>Christian scribes found it hard to envisage Jesus as being forsaken by God. </p>
Later on, when the doctrine of the divinity of Christ was rmly established
<p>in the Christian Church, theological questions were posed such as “Could </p>
<p>197. Augustine Letter 140 speaks of Christ’s identication with vulnerable humanity.</p>
