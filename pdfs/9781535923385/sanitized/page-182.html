<p>Excursus: e Appropriation of Psalm 118:22–23</p>
<p>164</p>
<p>as David, who despite being despised by many became the most celebrated </p>
<p>king of Israel. This may accord with the original setting of the Psalm, which </p>
<p>is probably written for the celebration of military victory.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>Finally we should note that the scripture cited not only aptly expounds the </p>
<p>fate of the Messiah, but also bets the occasion. Psalm 118 concludes the </p>
<p>Hallel Psalms (Pss 113—18), which are sung as part of the Passover liturgy. </p>
<p>It was also the psalm the crowd used to greet Jesus when he entered Jerusa-</p>
<p>lem. Hence, Jesus is using what is in many people’s minds.</p>
<p>Paying Taxes to Caesar (12:13–17)</p>
<p>Some Pharisees and Herodians are sent to trap Jesus with his own words. </p>
<p>Although not specied, Mark probably intends his audience to think of the </p>
<p>commissioners as the ruling priests, the scribes and the elders (11:27). We </p>
<p>have here an interesting collusion of parties that are oen opposed to each </p>
<p>other in policies and beliefs (chief priests—mainly Sadducees—and Phari-</p>
<p>sees; Pharisees and Herodians; cf. 3:6).</p>
<p>e question asked is about whether a Jew should pay taxes to Caesar </p>
<p>(v. 15).e tax in question is a form of poll tax of one denarius—the wage </p>
<p>for a day’s work.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>In Jesus’ day, only Jews in Judea paid this poll tax, because</p>
<p>it became a Roman province in AD 6 when Archelaus, Antipas’s brother, </p>
<p>was forced to abdicate by Jewish protest and Roman greed. A Galilean Jew </p>
<p>was not subjected to this Roman poll tax, as they had Herod Antipas as their </p>
<p>ruler. When the legate Quirinius conducted a census to facilitate the proper </p>
<p>collection of this tax, a revolutionary by the name of Judas the Galilean rose </p>
<p>up and summoned many Jews to revolt against Roman rule. According to </p>
<p>Josephus, the slogan used in this revolt was “only God is our king” (Antiqui-</p>
<p>ties 18:4–6, 23–25). Rome responded with great military might, and many </p>
<p>lives were lost as a result. Hence, the question is meant to put Jesus between </p>
<p>the rock and a hard place.If he answers “yes,” the Zealots and many in Judea </p>
<p>will turn against him, as paying the tax supports subjugation by a foreign </p>
<p>power. If the answer is “no,” Jesus may be hurled before a Roman magistrate </p>
<p>and charged with sedition.</p>
<p>45. Allen 1983: 123–24.</p>
<p>46. Schürer 1973: 1:401–4. Rome imposes two forms of direct taxation: a tributum </p>
<p>soli (tax on agriculture produce), and a tributum capitis (which is an amalgamated tax </p>
<p>on both head count (poll tax) and property). Whatever the function or ends, the tax </p>
<p>connotes subjugation to non-Romans.</p>
