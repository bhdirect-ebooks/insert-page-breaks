<p>Acknowledgments</p>
<p>e sense of being an indebted member to a large and nurturing commu-</p>
<p>nity grows with the writing of a commentary. It is not an exaggeration to say </p>
<p>that a tome is certainly needed for me genuinely to thank everyone. Perhaps </p>
<p>this is why I nd the Christian concept of eternal life so enthralling. But this </p>
<p>also means I nd writing just a page of acknowledgments so dicult.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, opportunities must be seized, even if they are not ideal. </p>
<p>I would like therefore to thank the editors, Mike Bird and Craig Keener, </p>
<p>for their patience, encouragement, and trust. I mention trust because they </p>
<p>have committed to me the task of writing a commentary on one of the most </p>
<p>signicant books of the Christian church and, dare I also say, of this world. </p>
<p>Great is your faith, my friends! If there are faults in this enterprise, it has </p>
<p>nothing to do with vision but everything to do with execution.</p>
<p>e Principal of Trinity eological College, Singapore, deserves </p>
<p>special mention for his support and understanding, as I stole what little </p>
<p>time I had le over from administrative duties to pen some rather “bitty” </p>
<p>thoughts. My colleagues have been stimulating, and I nd myself inexora-</p>
<p>bly applying some of their wisdom and insights into my work. anks also </p>
<p>should be given to the librarian, Michael Mukunthan, for helping me trace </p>
<p>some obscure sources.</p>
<p>A busy husband also means a harried wife, especially when there are </p>
<p>three children in tow. at my home remains one that is orderly and nurtur-</p>
<p>ing bears testimony to her patience, love, and competence. Perhaps I may </p>
<p>one day write a book on Proverbs 31 as penance! But I do hope her sacrice </p>
<p>has not been in vain.</p>
