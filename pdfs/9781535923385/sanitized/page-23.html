<p>whether it means a literal departure from a certain locality or a euphemism </p>
<p>for death). at said, a case has been made that Irenaeus may, aer all, be </p>
<p>consistent with Papias.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, it does not contradict</p>
<p>the proposed pre-70 date. Taking all this into consideration, the range AD </p>
<p>64–68 appears cogent.</p>
<p>What is of signicance here is that these were turbulent years, occa-</p>
<p>sioned by Nero’s persecution of Christians in Rome (AD 64) and the Jewish </p>
<p>conict with Rome (AD 66–70), concluding in the destruction of Jerusalem </p>
<p>in AD 70. As Gaston observes, it is in this particular time span that all the </p>
<p>motifs of Mark 13 would be operative to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Provenance and Audience</p>
<p>e questions of provenance (i.e., where the document originated) and </p>
<p>audience may be answered by looking at the evidence provided by early </p>
<p>patristic testimony, and by the text itself.</p>
<p>To start with the former, the two best candidates are Rome and Egypt </p>
<p>(probably Alexandria). Early and wide testimony supports Rome as the </p>
<p>place of composition (the evidence is provided by Irenaeus, Clement of </p>
<p>Alexandria, and the Anti-Marcionite Prologues among many others). is </p>
<p>is further supported by the presence of Latinisms in the Gospel (see es-</p>
<p>pecially Mark 7:26; 12:42; 15:16).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>ese are either Latin terms that have</p>
<p>been transliterated into Greek, or terms that have a uniquely Roman avor. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Mark’s text assumes a Gentile audience (cf. 7:3–4), especially </p>
<p>one that was well-versed in the OT because he cites from it and alludes to it </p>
<p>in many places. e Christian community at Rome ts this bill: Paul’s letter </p>
<p>to the Romans paints a picture of a Gentile community that knows its LXX </p>
<p>well.</p>
<p>e other candidate attested in patristic writings is Egypt. e tes-</p>
<p>timony is provided by one lonely voice: John Chrysostom (c. 347–407). </p>
<p>Measured against the early and widely-attested Roman provenance,</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>Egyptian provenance appears improbable. at said, there is a rich tradition </p>
<p>that locates Mark in Alexandria, but this does not necessarily contradict </p>
<p>the testimony that the Gospel was written in Rome. Eusebius mentions that </p>
