<p>On the Road to Jerusalem</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>10:1–31140</p>
<p>e motif of reversal is mentioned again in an epigram (cf. 9:35). e </p>
<p>function here is probably to prevent the disciples from adopting a trium-</p>
<p>phalistic attitude. Following Jesus has its rewards, but this must not be un-</p>
<p>derstood as going on a reward chase so as to be put on a pedestal above the </p>
<p>rest of humanity. e rst shall be last and the last rst must be the slogan </p>
<p>of the kingdom. It is all about honoring even the lowliest and serving them.</p>
<p>To sum up: the three stories of this section have as their central concern the </p>
<p>values that relate to the kingdom of God. Such values cut across the grain </p>
<p>of many an accepted institution, attitude or norm. But they do so not in </p>
<p>the interest of being dicult and demanding, as though discipleship were a </p>
<p>contest to see who might be the most ascetic or acerbic. No, they are what </p>
they are in the interest of returning to the divine intention behind the cre-
<p>ation of this world. is intention is now revealed through the ministry of </p>
<p>Jesus of Nazareth. e possibility of attaining this is graciously given also </p>
<p>through it. All this is but another idiom for saying that God has begun his </p>
<p>eschatological reign!</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Marriage, Social Inequality, and Wealth</p>
<p>Marriage, inequality in society, and wealth are still explosive issues today. </p>
<p>Divorce rates are on the rise in many societies, countering the belief that as </p>
<p>societies further their economic development, families should be happier. </p>
<p>Class distinctions, whatever the variety, continue to rear their ugly heads </p>
<p>in ever subtle forms—and sometimes brazenly—in spite of laws that have </p>
<p>been promulgated to prevent them. We happily sacriﬁce the future of the </p>
<p>vulnerable for our own gain. The quest for wealth often becomes toxic, lead-</p>
<p>ing to greater economic polarization.</p>
<p>These areas come under the kingdom spotlight in the passage. It is </p>
<p>by subjecting ourselves to the rule of God that we come to understand what </p>
<p>being married means, how to treat our fellow human beings, and where true </p>
<p>wealth may be found. We do not pretend to know everything about such </p>
<p>explosive issues but the following may safely be claimed. Being married </p>
<p>means faithfully cleaving to our spouse in spite of the slings and arrows of </p>
<p>outrageous fortune. Furthermore, we are to accept all, especially the weak </p>
<p>and vulnerable in society, because God accepts all. In God’s kingdom, all </p>
<p>are vulnerable children. Finally, wealth is to be shared. By sharing we bless </p>
<p>and are blessed. We are not impoverished in the process but are actually </p>
