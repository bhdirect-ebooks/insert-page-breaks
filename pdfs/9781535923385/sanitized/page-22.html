<p>Introduction4</p>
<p>we should have expected some sort of dierentiation: either by assigning a </p>
<p>title, or a toponym. Since there is no such attempt, it is reasonable to think </p>
<p>that only one person is referred to: John Mark who was once the travelling </p>
<p>companion of Paul but who became closely associated with Peter later on.</p>
<p>Can we know more about John Mark? Additional information may </p>
<p>be found in the Anti-Marcionite Prologues (c. AD 180), that is if these en-</p>
<p>shrined an authentic traditions. In the relevant Prologue, Mark is described </p>
<p>as stumpy-ngered. is datum might interest some readers but it adds </p>
<p>nothing signicant to our interpretation of his book.</p>
<p>What if our identication is wrong? Nothing substantial is aected in </p>
<p>terms of exegesis if we are only concerned with unpacking the message of </p>
<p>the book. Of course, if it is true that the book is written by John Mark, and </p>
<p>that Peter was his source, the implication for historical reconstruction of </p>
<p>earliest Christianity would certainly be signicant.</p>
<p>Date</p>
<p>Many scholars date the composition of Mark’s Gospel to a time before the </p>
<p>destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> One reason for this is that in chap-</p>
<p>ter 13 Jesus is recorded as predicting the destruction of the Temple. Since </p>
<p>Mark is fond of adding editorial comments (e.g., 7:3–4), we should expect a </p>
<p>mention that this prophecy had been fullled if the book was written post-</p>
<p>70. Furthermore, Josephus tells us that there was a great re that destroyed </p>
<p>the Temple. e fact that none of these is mentioned speaks for a pre-70 </p>
<p>composition.</p>
<p>Is it possible to be more precise? e text oers little help here, except </p>
<p>for 13:14, that is, if we can decipher its referent. In this verse Mark signals to </p>
<p>the reader to take special note of what is said (“let the reader understand”). </p>
<p>is suggests either the abomination of desolation has already been set up </p>
<p>or the event is imminent. If we are right in identifying this as the occupation </p>
<p>of the Temple by the Zealots and the forced appointment of Phanias as the </p>
<p>High Priest (see the treatment of chapter 13), this brings us to the shadow of </p>
<p>AD 67–68. However, the identication of the abomination of desolation is a </p>
<p>highly contentious issue, and so we must look to other evidence.</p>
<p>We turn, once again, to early patristic testimony. When we compare </p>
<p>the relevant statements of Papias and Irenaeus, an apparent discrepancy </p>
<p>surfaces. Was Mark’s Gospel written before or aer Peter’s death? Much </p>
<p>hinges on how we interpret the term exodos in Irenaeus’s testimony (i.e., </p>
<p>13. E.g., Collins 2007: 14; and Guelich 1989: xxxi–xxxii. e prominent scholars </p>
<p>who opt for a post-70 date are Pesch 1980: 14; and Evans 2001: lxiii.</p>
