<p>e Sign and the Yeast 105</p>
<p>where he performed signs to show that God was on the side of the Jews, and </p>
<p>would be acting powerfully to rescue them from Egypt.</p>
<p>Jesus’ description of the Pharisees as “this generation” is signicant </p>
<p>(v. 12). e phrase hē hautē genea is used four times in Mark. Two of its </p>
<p>occurrences are found in this verse (the other occurrences being 8:38 and </p>
<p>13:30). Verse 9:19 has a phrase which resembles it closely (ō apistos genea, </p>
<p>which means “O unbelieving generation”). Furthermore, it is found only on </p>
<p>the lips of Jesus in the gospel traditions and is almost always used negatively. </p>
<p>It is plausible that behind such a phrase stands the story of the testing (cf. </p>
<p>peirazō) of God by Israel at Massa and Meriba (Exod 17:1–7).</p>
<p>189</p>
<p> So signi-</p>
<p>cant is this story that, just before entering the Promised Land, Moses refers </p>
<p>to it again in his summary of their wilderness experience (Deut 6:16; 9:22 </p>
<p>and 33:8). e re-telling of this episode is also done in Ps 95:7–11, where </p>
<p>those people are expressly called a generation in v. 10. e upshot of all this </p>
<p>is that the Pharisees are reprising the role of the wilderness generation, a </p>
<p>generation which tempted God repeatedly with demands for signs because </p>
<p>of their chronic obduracy.</p>
<p>Jesus’ reply is curt and is prefaced with the words, “Amen, I say to you,” </p>
<p>a clause indicating that what is to follow is of great signicance. is ap-</p>
<p>pears in Greek as a conditional sentence that provides only the protasis (i.e., </p>
<p>the “if” clause) without giving the apodosis (i.e., the “then” clause). is is </p>
<p>indicative of an underlying Semitic syntax, which uses only the protasis of a </p>
<p>conditional clause to make a solemn declaration. e imprecation that is to </p>
<p>be provided by the apodosis is le unspoken. Fully translated it runs: “Amen </p>
<p>I say to you, if a sign were to be given to this generation, may God then do </p>
<p>such-and-such to me” (the words in italics are le unsaid). So it is certainly </p>
<p>correct to regard the sentence as indicating a strong negative: no such sign </p>
<p>will ever be given. See 2 Kings 6:31 for a similar but fuller expression.</p>
<p>Jesus’ curt reply can now be unraveled. What the Pharisees are asking </p>
<p>for is to some extent already being performed. e signs that God is now </p>
<p>establishing his eschatological rule are found in Jesus’ ministry, precisely </p>
<p>through his teaching, his reconciling activity and chiey that of his healing </p>
<p>and exorcism. ose with eyes to see will know that the eschatological age </p>
<p>has dawned, even while mundane history continues to run its course. But </p>
<p>these activities are not regarded by the religious authorities, especially the </p>
<p>Pharisees, as constituting the signs of the kingdom. What they want is some-</p>
<p>thing “open.” ey want a sign that is both apocalyptic and triumphalist (i.e., </p>
<p>demonstrating God’s powerful rescue of the Jews by the destruction of their </p>
<p>enemies and the bequeathing of glory to them). If this is what authenticates </p>
<p>189. Marcus 2000: 500–501.</p>
