<p>e Beginning of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>1:2–1320</p>
<p>Avian images have been used of the Spirit’s work of creation in the OT </p>
<p>and Jewish literature (Gen 1:2; b. Hag. 15a; cf. 4Q521 1:6, where eschatologi-</p>
<p>cal re-creation is in view). is theme does relate to the theological nuances </p>
<p>of Mark’s description of the beginning of the gospel. However, why does </p>
<p>Mark specify a dove? In the alleged parallels, a dove is never mentioned. </p>
<p>Recently, it has been proposed that Mark is countering the Roman symbol </p>
<p>of an eagle with the dove.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> ere is much mileage in this but in our opin-</p>
<p>ion it is still decient, as it neglects the Jewish background. e dove oen </p>
<p>stands for Israel in Jewish literature (Hos 7.11; b. Ber 53b; b. Sab 49a), but </p>
<p>never once is it used of the Spirit, with the possible exception of Targum to </p>
<p>Canticles 2:12, where the voice of the turtledove is interpreted as the voice of </p>
<p>the Spirit. Even so, it is clear that this parallel is not exact.</p>
<p>One possible solution is to regard the simile as a complex reference </p>
<p>to the Spirit’s work of remaking Israel as having been devolved upon Jesus </p>
<p>through his spiritual anointing and empowerment. Aer all, the Spirit is </p>
<p>understood in the prophetic literature as the end-time gi that remakes </p>
<p>Israel (see especially Ezek 36–37). All this will explain why Jesus in Mark </p>
<p>represents Israel, and at the same time calls upon the nation to follow him </p>
<p>in order to gain the kingdom. Admittedly this is speculative, but its conso-</p>
<p>nance with many Markan themes makes it somewhat appealing. However, </p>
<p>if a safe but bland answer is required, it is that the dove is a clean animal for </p>
<p>sacrice (Gen 15:9; Lev 1:14; 12:6; 15:14, 29).</p>
irdly, the visual symbol is accompanied by the divine voice, which
<p>arms Jesus as his beloved Son.If we discount the occurrence of this no-</p>
<p>menclature in v. 1 because of textual uncertainty, this will then be the rst </p>
<p>time Jesus is called God’s Son. Scholars have debated the precise nature of </p>
<p>the background to this verse: whether it is based on Ps 2:7; Isa 42:1 (for this </p>
<p>to work, it must be conjectured that an original pais has been transmuted to </p>
<p>huios); or Gen 22:2. If we are right to propose that sonship language should </p>
<p>rst and foremost be understood as election language when used of human </p>
<p>beings, Ps 2:7 appears to be the more suitable background, being a verse </p>
<p>from an enthronement psalm. But there is no need to think of a precise </p>
<p>passage. What is more important is the story and role underlying such a title. </p>
<p>Jesus as God’s beloved Son takes Israel’s role upon himself and rule as God’s </p>
vicegerent.is divine pronouncement gives the true perspective on Jesus’
<p>identity for the reader.</p>
<p>As the Son of God, Jesus is then led by the Spirit to be tempted by </p>
<p>Satan in the wilderness, which Mark describes rather briey (vv. 12–13). </p>
<p>Jesus may be regarded here as recapitulating the experience of Israel in the </p>
<p>22. Peppard 2010: 431–51.</p>
