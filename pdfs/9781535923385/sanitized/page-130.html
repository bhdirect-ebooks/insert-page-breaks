<p>On the Road to Jerusalem</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>8:31—9:1112</p>
<p>he is not blind like the crowds but “perceives” Jesus’ true identity. A look at </p>
<p>the word-statistics will conrm this. e title “Messiah” is used of Jesus only </p>
<p>once in the heading of the work before this passage. No other character has </p>
<p>confessed Jesus with this title up to this stage. Aer this, the word will be </p>
<p>used a few times in Mark’s Gospel, for discussing and disputing over Jesus’ </p>
<p>identity (12:35; 14:61; cf. 9:41; 13:21–22).</p>
<p>However, Peter’s confession is only partially right, as what messiahship </p>
<p>truly entails has to be hammered out on the anvil of following the suering </p>
<p>Jesus. In other words, although Peter perceives the true identity of Jesus, </p>
<p>he has yet to perceive the true signicance of that identity. is may be part </p>
<p>of the reason why this confession, which appears to be something like a </p>
<p>breakthrough in the plot of Mark’s Gospel, is to be kept under wraps, at least </p>
<p>for the time being.</p>
<p>The Messiah Must Suffer: The First Passion Prediction </p>
<p>(8:31—9:1)</p>
<p>is passage is closely connected with the previous one, and serves an im-</p>
<p>portant theological purpose in Mark’s Gospel. It explicates what messiah-</p>
<p>ship means, and also what confessing Jesus as Messiah entails for the true </p>
<p>confessor. It is not the triumphalism (cf. the “yeast” of 8:15) of the Pharisees </p>
<p>or Herod. Instead it is about taking up the cross and denying oneself. So a </p>
<p>new twist is given to the traditional notion of messiahship, a twist that even </p>
<p>the hitherto perceiving Peter has not fully grasped.</p>
<p>e Rebuke of Peter (8:31–33)</p>
<p>Mark informs us that aer Peter’s confession, Jesus begins to teach that the </p>
<p>Son of Man must suer, be killed, and be raised again aer three days (vv. </p>
<p>31–32). A few things must be noted here in order the full impact of what </p>
<p>Mark intends is felt.</p>
<p>e rst is that Jesus responds to Peter’s confession with his own fa-</p>
<p>vorite self-designation of Son of Man. It is as though Jesus is qualifying the </p>
<p>notion of Messiah with the Son of Man. is designation has been held in </p>
<p>abeyance since 2:28, but it appears now at a critical juncture of the narrative. </p>
<p>We have earlier argued that the background that best explains Jesus’ use of </p>
<p>this designation is Daniel 7. We nd a new twist to the concept here, as it is </p>
<p>stated that the Son of Man must suer. ere is no clear indication of this </p>
<p>in Daniel, only that this gure is identied with God’s beleaguered people </p>
<p>(Dan 7:18, 21–22, 25). Even so, his introduction results in their vindication, </p>
