<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>5:1–2066</p>
<p>e state of the demoniac is poignantly described. His superhu-</p>
<p>man strength renders him uncontrollable. But behind such strength lies a </p>
<p>wrecked human being, alone and naked—a pain to others and a pain to </p>
<p>himself (vv. 3–5, 15). Regarded as posing a danger to the community, he is </p>
<p>therefore restrained by chains. Such actions do not, however, solve the root </p>
<p>problem.</p>
<p>In pleading with Jesus not to torture him, the demoniac also confesses </p>
<p>his status (v. 7). Jesus is called the Son of the Most High God, the longest </p>
<p>title to be accorded him in Mark’s Gospel. Interestingly, the same title is also </p>
<p>found in Luke 1:32 and 4Q246. In the latter passage, it functions most prob-</p>
<p>ably as a messianic title.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>ere is also a certain aptness to the title, in that</p>
<p>the term “Most High God” is oen used in a polytheistic context to refer to </p>
<p>the supreme god (cf. Gen 14:18–20; Pindar Nemean Odes 1:60; 11:20, where </p>
<p>Zeus is referred to as the “Most High.”). In Jewish literature, Gentiles are </p>
<p>sometimes described as calling Yahweh the Most High God (Num 24:16; </p>
<p>Dan 3:26; 4:2; 2 Macc 3:31; 3 Macc. 7:9; cf. Acts 16:17). us the title serves </p>
<p>the function of a monotheistic polemic, and hints at the ethnicity of the </p>
<p>demoniac.</p>
<p>e fascinating conversation that ensues should not be regarded as </p>
<p>a tussle for power between the demons and Jesus, since Mark’s narrative </p>
<p>consistently portrays Jesus as having unrivalled and unchallenged authority </p>
<p>when it comes to evil or chaotic forces.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>In fact, the conversation serves</p>
<p>a pedagogical purpose. e name “Legion” is certainly a Roman military </p>
<p>term. A Roman legion comprised about ve thousand troops when in full </p>
<p>strength, but most legions were normally not at full strength. is will then </p>
<p>bring the number closer to the 2,000 pigs which they will later inhabit (v. </p>
<p>13). e presence of this term, among some other indicators,</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>suggests to</p>
<p>some commentators that the story may be a sort of political commentary. </p>
<p>108. Fitzmyer, 1993: 153–74; Collins 1993b: 65–82.</p>
<p>109. Cf. France 2002: 228–29. e demoniac’s petition “Swear to God that you won’t </p>
<p>torture me” has elicited an interesting proposal. e Greek behind the word “swear” is </p>
<p>orkizō. is is oen used in exorcistic contexts, by the exorcist and not the exorcised </p>
<p>(cf. Acts 19:13). Consequently, some commentators have taken this as implying the </p>
<p>demoniac’s intention to preempt or counter any exorcistic action by Jesus, (i.e., using </p>
<p>the exorcist’s term on the exorcist himself). is, however, is making too much out of </p>
<p>just one term.</p>
<p>110. E.g., “a large herd of pigs” (v. 11). e word for “herd” here is agelē, which is </p>
<p>rather unusual for pigs because it is typically used to describe troops. is is further </p>
<p>indication that Mark intends his listeners to treat this story as alluding to the Roman </p>
<p>military annexation of Palestinian territory. Pigs are regarded as unclean animals in the </p>
<p>OT (Lev 11:7–8; Deut 14:8), and have also become a symbol of paganism (cf. Matt 7:6; </p>
<p>2 Pet 2:22).</p>
