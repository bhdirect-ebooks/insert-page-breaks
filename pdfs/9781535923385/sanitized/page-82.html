<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>5:1–2064</p>
<p>of the disciples, nothing can be more disheartening than to see their master </p>
<p>soundly asleep in a crisis (v. 38), and hence the rebuke: “Teacher, don’t you </p>
<p>care that we perish?” Jesus addresses the storm as though it were a person (v. </p>
<p>39). Although his words recall the exorcism of 1:25, there is no compelling </p>
<p>reason to think an exorcism is also taking place.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>e questions of Jesus reveal what the main problem with the disciples </p>
<p>is they lack faith (v. 40). e Greek adverb oupō, which means “not yet” or </p>
<p>“still,” indicates that by now the disciples should have developed a robust </p>
<p>faith. is is especially so if they have been given privileged insights not </p>
<p>available to others (cf. 4:10–12). At this point an alert audience should have </p>
<p>perceived that two aspects of the theme of faith have been presented: trust </p>
<p>like Jesus and trust in Jesus.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>e nal statement of the disciples (v. 41) reveals another important </p>
<p>aspect of the story. In the OT, the sea oen represents primeval chaos, </p>
<p>which only God can tame (Job 26:11–12; Ps 104:7; Isa 51:9–10). Up to this </p>
<p>stageMark has presented Jesus as an authoritative teacher, a healer and also </p>
<p>an exorcist. However, a new datum is given now: Jesus can also control the </p>
<p>forces of nature. He can calm storms like God.Indeed,the thrice occurrence </p>
<p>of the word “great” in a short compass of six verses (“great storm” (v. 37), </p>
<p>“great calm” (v. 39) and “great fear” (v. 41)) further supports this insight. </p>
<p>Jesus’ authority evokes awe and any description of it must bet the adjective </p>
<p>“g re at .”</p>
<p>However, the juxtaposition of the theme of “faith” with “Jesus’ great-</p>
<p>ness” gives rise to an irony: great power should engender great faith, but this </p>
<p>is not the case here. is irony looms large in the chapters that follow.</p>
<p>Healing the Gerasene Demoniac (5:1–20)</p>
<p>is story is strange by many standards, ancient and modern, and oen </p>
<p>leaves students of Mark baed. Although having links with earlier exor-</p>
<p>cism narratives (1:21–28; 1:32–34; 3:11–12), it goes beyond them in terms </p>
<p>of intensity (a legion of demons), setting (a thoroughly unclean place), and </p>
<p>dialogue (an extended one). It also has links with the next two miracle sto-</p>
<p>ries via the theme of ritual impurity. In this sense they show Jesus’ cleansing </p>
<p>power at work. Furthermore, it shows for the rst time Jesus ministering in </p>
<p>of a sleeping Jesus is meant to show his likeness to God (see Marcus 2000:338; cf. Batto: </p>
<p>1987: 153–77).</p>
<p>105. Cf. Collins 2007: 261.</p>
<p>106. Marcus 2000: 334.</p>
