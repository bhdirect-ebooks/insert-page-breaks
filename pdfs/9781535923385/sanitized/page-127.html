<p>On the Road to Jerusalem: The Gospel and the </p>
<p>Suffering Messiah (8:22—10:52)</p>
<p>The Stuttering Beginnings of True Perception (8:22–30)</p>
<p>e episodes of the two-stage healing of the blind man (8:22–26) and Peter’s </p>
<p>confession (8:27–30) both take place away from Galilean soil. Coming as </p>
<p>they are, aer the poignant questions asked by Jesus about the disciples’ </p>
<p>spiritual sight and understanding (8:14–21), these episodes may be regard-</p>
<p>ed as a kind of narrative commentary on what treatments of this malady </p>
<p>may look like.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that from the story of the healing of the blind </p>
<p>man onwards, Jesus seldom sets foot again on Galilee. Instead, he charts a </p>
<p>course for Jerusalem, aer wandering for a while in Gentile territory (Beth-</p>
<p>saida and Caesarea Philippi). As it is well known, Mark narrates only one </p>
<p>trip of Jesus to Jerusalem. Hence, many commentators regard this story as </p>
<p>beginning the second half of Mark’s Gospel, where Jesus is depicted as being </p>
<p>inexorably drawn to Jerusalem for the climax of his ministry.</p>

<p>Many lessons</p>
<p>on discipleship are taught and the phrase “on the way”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>(8:27; 9:34; 10:17;</p>
<p>10:32) occurs frequently, indicating that the journey to Jerusalem is also a </p>
<p>foil to clarifying what discipleship means.</p>
<p>e Healing of the Blind Man at Bethsaida (8:22–26)</p>
<p>is is the rst time Mark relates a story of the healing of a blind person. </p>
<p>What is so striking about it, however, is that it is the only miracle that shows </p>
<p>a two-stage healing process, giving the impression that the initial action of </p>
<p>Jesus is not fully ecacious. Perhaps this is one episode that early Chris-</p>
<p>tian preachers would quite happily forget, as the other three Gospels do not </p>
<p>contain such a story. However, Mark sees in this a deeper signicance, and </p>
