<p>More Revolutionary Values for Disciples 133</p>
e rst question asked by the Pharisees concerns the legality of divorce (v.
<p>2). e reply of Jesus is shrewd and wise for three reasons. First, it will lead </p>
<p>them back to Torah, the accepted norm for all Jews. Secondly, through a </p>
<p>closer look at the relevant text (Deut 24:1–4) it will be seen that Moses did </p>
not command divorce. is will then set the ensuing discussion on the right premise: divorce was given as a concession and not a command. It is pre-
<p>carious to build ethics based on a concession. If the foregoing is accepted, </p>
<p>the discussion will then, thirdly, move to consider the origin of marriage. </p>
Indeed, if there is a command pertaining to marriage and divorce in what
<p>Moses wrote, it is found in Gen 2:24. is assumes, of course, that Jesus and </p>
<p>the Pharisees think of Genesis as being written by Moses.</p>
<p>e Pharisees reply that Moses permitted it (v. 4). In Jesus’, day, a cer-</p>
ticate of divorce would have been given which would allow the divorced woman—since only the husband could initiate divorce proceedings—to
<p>remarry. What needed to be ascertained, in order to prevent abuse, were the </p>
just grounds for divorce. Many of the rabbinic traditions touching on this
<p>topic are about such grounds.</p>

<p>Jesus’ reply acknowledges the existence of this provision (v. 5). How-</p>
<p>ever, in order to prevent concession from sliding to normalcy, he points out </p>
<p>that the Mosaic regulation (Deut 24:1–4) was given because of the “hard-</p>
<p>ness of hearts.” is is a telling phrase, as it recalls the condition of Israel so </p>
<p>oen castigated by the prophets, which led ultimately to the rupture of the </p>
<p>Sinaitic covenant and exile (Deut 10:16; Jer 4:4). e phenomenon is also </p>
<p>referred to in Mark 4:12 and 8:17. In other words, the provision was given </p>
not to encourage divorce but to serve as a damage-control measure.
<p>Jesus now appeals to rst principles instead of casuistry (vv. 6–8) (i.e., </p>
the original intention behind the divine gi of marriage [Gen 1:27; 2:24]),
<p>before the deterioration of sin has set in which calls for legislation. at said, </p>
<p>it must be noted the reference point is still Moses, as both Deuteronomy </p>
<p>and Genesis are regarded as stemming from him. is is important, as it </p>
<p>indicates that Jesus has not departed from the agreed frame of reference. </p>
<p>Otherwise, the argument would have been weakened.</p>
<p>Citing from Gen 1:27 and 2:24, Jesus draws the implication that mar-</p>
<p>riage amounts to becoming one esh (v. 8). Although Jesus does not explain </p>
<p>exactly what “one esh” means, he nonetheless points out what it entails: </p>
<p>what God has joined together, let none separate. e contrast between two </p>
<p>acting agents, viz. God and human beings, makes the point clear: God wants </p>
<p>marriages to last, and human beings must not use initiatives or institutions </p>
<p>to break them. is sets the teaching of Jesus in stark contrast with the Hillel </p>
<p>40. See the tractate Gittin in the Talmud.</p>
