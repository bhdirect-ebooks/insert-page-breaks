<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>6:1–6a72</p>
<p>ingrained vividly in an eyewitness’s mind. e dead girl responds, rises, and </p>
<p>walks about. Jairus’s faith in Jesus is vindicated.</p>
<p>We are also informed by Mark that Jesus does not want this miracle to </p>
<p>be published abroad (v. 43). is means that those who derided him will be </p>
<p>le guessing whether a miracle has occurred or a misunderstanding cleared. </p>
<p>is ts in well with the theme of secrecy in Mark’s Gospel. </p>
<p>Mark’s Achievement with the Cycle of Four Miracle Stories</p>
<p>With the cycle of four miracle stories (4:35—5:43), Mark has gone beyond </p>
<p>simply depicting Jesus as a miracle worker. He has succeeded in showing </p>
<p>Jesus in more dramatic and spectacular terms. All this makes the question </p>
<p>of his identity more urgent. Who is this person who can control forces as-</p>
<p>sociated with the primeval chaos, tame a legion of evil forces, cleanse the </p>
<p>chronically impure, and raise the dead?</p>
<p>Alongside this urgent question chimes the theme of faith. Will faith be </p>
<p>put in Jesus when circumstances seem to indicate otherwise: when boister-</p>
<p>ous waves break upon the bow; when the majority reject him; when all hu-</p>
<p>man ability fails in solving a medical problem; and when all hopes are gone </p>
<p>because death has come about? e words “Do not be afraid, only believe” </p>
<p>(5:36) are absolutely apt, and serve also as an exhortation to faith.</p>
<p>is cycle then brings together in creative fashion the themes of Jesus’ </p>
<p>identity and faith in him. is ts hand in glove with the earlier emphasis in </p>
<p>the collection of parables (4:1–34) about the hidden nature of the kingdom. </p>
<p>If the kingdom is hidden, faith is certainly the needed response.</p>
<p>The Rejection at Nazareth (6:1–6a)</p>
<p>Mark has not forgotten the staggering message he has conveyed in 4:10–12, </p>
<p>regarding the purpose of parables. He follows his collection of four miracles </p>
<p>(4:35—5:43) with an episode of rejection (6:1–6a), highlighting yet again </p>
<p>the obduracy theme. What makes this more poignant is that the rejection </p>
<p>comes from the people who are from the same hometown as Jesus. Of </p>
<p>course, the alert listener would know this was not a new twist to the plot. </p>
<p>Already in chapter 3 Jesus was portrayed as a stumbling block even to his </p>
<p>own family members.</p>
<p>363; cf. also Collins 2007: 286). However, the fact that Mark provides a translation </p>
<p>would mean that he is intent on removing the mysterious element, and the language </p>
<p>used, though foreign to Greek speakers, is native to the characters of the story.</p>
