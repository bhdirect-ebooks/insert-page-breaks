<p>The Beginning of the Gospel (1:1–13)</p>
<p>The Heading (1:1)</p>
<p>In a world where many things compete for the interest of a potential reader, </p>
<p>the beginning of a book must be written in such a way as to be attention-</p>
<p>grabbing. Its role is therefore critical because not only has it to perform the </p>
<p>aforesaid function, it has also to inform the reader, at least in an implicit </p>
<p>way, of what is to come.</p>
<p>What we now have shows that Mark has opened his narrative admi-</p>
<p>rably. Not only are highly potent terms in his culture used (“beginning,” </p>
<p>“gospel,” “Christ” and possibly “Son of God”), they are also expressed with </p>
<p>an unexpected twist, signaling that what follows may be both explosive and </p>
<p>subversive. We will explain how this takes place, but rst, a question con-</p>
<p>cerning the exact limits of the opening section of Mark has to be discussed.</p>
<p>Verse 1 serves certainly as a heading. What is disputed among scholars </p>
<p>is whether it is the heading of the entire work or just a section, such as </p>
<p>1:1–13 or 1:1–15.By virtue of its compressed style and the presence of nu-</p>
<p>merous signicant words,we incline to the view that it serves as the heading </p>
<p>of the entire work.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>A parallel that illuminates this is Hosea 1:2. We may also </p>
<p>mention the fact that Mark does not write sectional headings, not even for </p>
<p>his important Passion Narrative.</p>
<p>at said, we note that the Greek kathōs (“just as”) introduces vv. 2–3. </p>
<p>Without the usual complement of a houtōs (“so”) clause, it implies that </p>
<p>kathōs introduces a statement (i.e., vv. 2–3) to complete an earlier one (i.e., </p>
<p>v. 1). is means v. 1 does not stand alone as a sentence, as we might expect </p>
<p>the heading of the work to be. Verse 1 may then be understood as both the </p>
<p>heading of the work and forming part of the opening section.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> is may ap-</p>
<p>pear confusing but it may have come about because Mark is not concerned </p>
<p>with formal style. It is also possible that Mark is creatively ambivalent.</p>
