<p>Miracles Around the Lake 81</p>
<p>generous promises in order to boast of their wealth or generosity (Herodo-</p>
<p>tus, Histories 9:109).</p>
<p>Modern readers may also be puzzled by Mark’s recounting that she </p>
<p>nally asks for John the Baptist’s head on a platter, as advised by her mother. </p>
<p>Why did she settle for this when she could have so much more? A moment’s </p>
<p>reection will show that she was actually acting prudently. As mentioned </p>
<p>earlier, oriental monarchs were known for making generous oers at rash </p>
<p>moments (perhaps to demonstrate their great generosity in front of honored </p>
<p>guests) or in a state of drunkenness, which they actually had no intention of </p>
<p>fullling. If Herodias’s daughter had greedily asked for half of Herod’s king-</p>
<p>dom, the request might be granted in word, but in actual fact she would not </p>
<p>receive it. ere were ways to ensure this. Stories of mysterious deaths oen </p>
<p>emanated from royal courts. So she was wise to consult her mother, since </p>
<p>the latter, being intimate with Antipas, must have known what might safely </p>
<p>be asked. Asking for the execution of John the Baptist was a request that </p>
<p>could be fullled straightaway, without much loss to Antipas, and would </p>
<p>rid the family of a pesky foe. e macabre detail of having John’s head on </p>
<p>a platter is not mentioned in the suggestion of Herodias in 6:24b, and may </p>
<p>perhaps be construed as the dancing girl’s own contribution. Putting John’s </p>
<p>head on a platter suggests it was part of the banqueting menu. Such black </p>
<p>humor indicates the sort of depravity that was at work.</p>
<p>Antipas’s predicament is also historically credible. He had a fascina-</p>
<p>tion for John, but this did not translate to loyalty (vv. 19–20). Moreover, </p>
<p>any postponing of the girl’s request would bring about a great loss of face </p>
<p>for him, as important and powerful guests were present. e execution was </p>
<p>thus carried out, and John’s corpse was later collected by his disciples for </p>
<p>burial.</p>
<p>e Return of the Twelve (6:30)</p>
<p>e return of the Twelve provides the end-framing component to the story </p>
<p>of John’s death. eir work has been eective, which has also led Antipas to </p>
<p>wonder whether John the Baptist was raised from the dead. e narration </p>
<p>of this return prepares the way for the next episode: the story of the feeding </p>
<p>of the 5,000.</p>
<p>Miracles Around the Lake (6:31–56)</p>
<p>Two miracle stories taking place around the lake are narrated here. e rst </p>
<p>is the feeding of the 5,000, a miracle Jesus performs using just ve loaves </p>
