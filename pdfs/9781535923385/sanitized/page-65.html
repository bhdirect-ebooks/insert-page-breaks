<p>e New People of God and Jesus’ True Family 47</p>
<p>how is Levi related to James the son of Alphaeus? Were they brothers, or </p>
<p>did they happen to have fathers with an identical name? Mark does not </p>
<p>answer these questions. Perhaps his focus was on the concept and role of the </p>
<p>Twelve, rather than their identity, apart from the prominent ones.</p>
<p>Another Simon is mentioned, who is nicknamed kananaios (v. 18). </p>
<p>is is certainly not a Greek word, and most scholars think it is a translit-</p>
<p>eration of the Aramaic qan’ānā’, which means an enthusiast or a patriot.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If this suggested derivation is correct (cf. Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13), Simon was </p>
<p>remembered either as someone who was patriotic to his nation, or perhaps </p>
<p>someone who had anity with the Zealots, a Jewish party that came into </p>
<p>prominence during the Jewish war with Rome (AD 66–70). If we are right </p>
<p>about the identity of Matthew and this Simon, we then have an interesting </p>
<p>coming together of two people who once subscribed to diametrically op-</p>
<p>posed agendas. One once worked for the Empire, and the other once worked </p>
<p>against the Empire. e signicant thing is that Jesus brings together people </p>
<p>with opposing agendas, and remakes them into the restored people of God.</p>
<p>Completing the list is Judas Iscariot (v. 19). e term “Iscariot” has </p>
<p>been explained dierently in the scholarly literature. By far the most popu-</p>
<p>lar is to split it up into ’îš + qĕriyyôt, which means in Hebrew “the man from </p>
<p>Kerioth,” thus indicating Judas’s place of origin.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>We do not know where</p>
<p>Kerioth is exactly because there are many places with such a name (cf. Josh </p>
<p>15:25; Jer 41:24). Perhaps this geographical reference is added to dieren-</p>
<p>tiate him from another Judas (cf. John 14:22). e other serious possibil-</p>
<p>ity is to construe the Greek as being derived from a semitized form of the </p>
<p>Latin sicarius, which means a bandit or a freedom ghter.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>If this is correct,</p>
<p>Judas may then be regarded as joining the movement of Jesus because he </p>
<p>thought he would be overthrowing the Romans to give Israel political free-</p>
<p>dom. When this idea was nally disabused, he betrayed him. is is a clever </p>
<p>hypothesis but the derivation appears too complicated to carry conviction.</p>
<p>Jesus’ True Family (3:20–35)</p>
<p>Two stories are combined here—the visit of Jesus’ family (vv. 20–21, 31–35) </p>
<p>and the Beelzeboul accusation by the scribes (vv. 23–30)—the latter being </p>
<p>intercalated by the former. is ancient rhetorical technique is designed to </p>
<p>bring episodes of similar meaning together, so that they may be mutually </p>
