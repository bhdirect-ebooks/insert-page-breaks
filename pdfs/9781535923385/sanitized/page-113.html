<p>Fusing the Horizons: Divine Integrity and the Abrogation of the </p>
<p>Purity Code</p>
<p>One nagging question arising from the episode is whether God contradicted </p>
<p>himself, since he was the one behind the food laws or purity code. In this </p>
<p>regard, it is important to remember the biblical emphasis that the heart is </p>
the heart of the matter. The purity code is given not out of divine caprice,
<p>but to serve as a concrete reminder of the holiness of God. That code must </p>
<p>never be understood as a talisman or as something to mask the evil of the </p>
<p>heart. This is one criticism the prophets made repeatedly (Amos 5:21–27; </p>
<p>Hos 6:6). However, the one who is greater than the prophets has come, and </p>
<p>brings with him the good news of the kingdom. This addresses the heart to </p>
<p>which the purity code served as a vivid signpost. When the destination is </p>
<p>reached the signpost is no longer needed. Or as Paul would put it, things </p>
<p>pertaining to childhood are put away when one reaches adulthood (1 Cor </p>
<p>13:11), not because they are bad or shameful but because maturity for </p>
<p>which childhood is an important preparatory phase is reached. So when the </p>
<p>evil of the heart is addressed and cured, the ceremonies that point to such </p>
<p>a reality are no longer required. The will of God is therefore upheld. Hence, </p>
<p>Jesus is not teaching that frivolity is the answer to rigid ceremonies, but the </p>
<p>heart of the matter of these ceremonies must always be kept in mind. We </p>
<p>can see why Mark’s Jesus is truly he who proclaims good news.</p>
<p>“All Foods Made Clean” and the Extension of the </p>
<p>Ministry to Gentiles (7:24–36)</p>
<p>Following the narration of a controversy that led Jesus to pronounce sayings </p>
<p>implying the obsolescence of the purity code, Mark now depicts Jesus going </p>
<p>to Gentile territories. While in these territories, Jesus performs an exorcism </p>
<p>(vv. 24–30) and a healing (vv. 31–36). Note that these are hallmarks of the </p>
<p>kingdom’s presence (1:21–28, 32–39; 3:22–30). Mark has already prepared </p>
<p>his audience for this by depicting in chapter 5 Jesus’ going to Gerasenes to </p>
<p>deliver a man from a legion of unclean spirits.</p>
