<p>solitary places that Jesus frequents in order to arrest him without causing </p>
<p>any commotion.</p>
<p>e Last Supper (14:12–31)</p>
<p>During a meal Jesus performs an action that speaks of the emptying of him-</p>
<p>self for the new people of God. is answers the action performed by the </p>
<p>unnamed woman who proigately emptied a jar of expensive perfume to </p>
<p>anoint Jesus.</p>
<p>Much has been discussed regarding the apparently diering chronolo-</p>
<p>gies provided by the Synoptic writers and John.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p> Arising from this discus-</p>
<p>sion, the question of what really is the type of meal envisaged by Mark is </p>
<p>also asked.</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>e position taken by this commentary is that Jesus intended</p>
<p>to hold the Passover meal one day in advance of the ocial celebration (see </p>
<p>excursus).</p>
<p>Excursus: The Chronology of the Last Supper in the Four Gospels</p>
<p>Four main proposals, with variations, have been made in scholarship:</p>
<p>1. There was a calendrical dispute amongst the Jews and the different </p>
<p>Gospel writers use different calendars to narrate Jesus’ last meal;</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>2. John’s chronology is historically inaccurate because of his theologi-</p>
<p>cal interest to depict Jesus as the sacriﬁced Passover lamb;</p>
<p>131</p>
<p>3. John’s chronology is correct and the Synoptic Gospels got it wrong, </p>
<p>as the meal was not intended to be a Passover meal. It was thought to be so </p>
<p>only in retrospect;</p>
<p>132</p>
<p> and</p>
<p>4. The Synoptic Gospels can be harmonized with John’s Gospel, by </p>
<p>postulating either that, despite appearances, the former did not intend us </p>
<p>to understand the meal to be a Passover meal, or that their accounts leave </p>
<p>open the possibility that a Passover meal was celebrated in advance of the </p>
<p>ofﬁcial one.</p>
