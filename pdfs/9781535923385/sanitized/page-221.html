<p>e Hearing by the Sanhedrin 203</p>
<p>the elders and the scribes. e second is the courtyard where Peter, aer </p>
<p>following the party from a distance, settles down to warm himself at the re </p>
<p>with the guards. In other words,two stories are running on parallel tracks. </p>
<p>While Jesus is being tried, Peter also faces a sort of “trial.”</p>
<p>Verses 55–56 inform us that initially the eyewitnesses’ testimonies </p>
<p>cannot agree. e accusation that Jesus claimed to destroy the Temple is </p>
<p>then made. For the Jewish context, this may be regarded as a heinous crime </p>
<p>(Josephus War 6:300–309; cf. Acts 21:27–36). To be sure, there is evidence </p>
<p>for the belief among Jews that the Messiah would be the one to build a new </p>
<p>Temple, but this does not envisage his destroying it in order to build it again </p>
<p>(Zech 6:12; Tg. Zech.6:12; 4QFlor 1:6–7).</p>
<p>166</p>
<p>e scenario is usually this:</p>
<p>the Temple is already destroyed or deled before the Messiah comes to the </p>
<p>rescue of Israel and reinstates her sacricial system.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p>is being the case,</p>
<p>the idea that Jesus’ opponents were trying to elicit from Jesus a messianic </p>
<p>confession appears weak. ere is strong evidence, however, to show that </p>
<p>any talk or prediction of the Temple’s destruction was construed as a threat </p>
<p>to it. is would make the person liable to punishment or even execution. </p>
<p>In AD 62 a person by the name of Jesus ben Ananias repeatedly predicted </p>
<p>the Temple’s destruction. is caused consternation amongst the leading </p>
<p>men of Jerusalem. Some of them were so incensed that they wanted him </p>
<p>dead, but he was brought before the Romans and was ogged to the bone </p>
<p>before being released (Josephus War 6:300–309). Such a harsh reaction may </p>
<p>be explainable as the attempt to safeguard the one symbol that speaks of the </p>
<p>unique Jewish identity, and the non-negotiable belief that God’s presence </p>
<p>is found among the Jews precisely because he has chosen to dwell in the </p>
<p>Temple.</p>
<p>ere is, however, no unanimous agreement even for this charge (v. </p>
<p>59). However, the fact that Mark highlights this shows how important the </p>
<p>charge is, for there is a grain of truth to it. Jesus did predict the Temple’s </p>
<p>destruction, and he did perform a provocative action to signify its rejection </p>
<p>(13:2; 11:15–17, 22–25). Of course, the way it has been interpreted by the </p>
<p>so-called eyewitnesses is far from Jesus’ original intent.</p>
<p>166. ere is a remote possibility that Lam. Rab. 1:5 may testify to this. In that pas-</p>
<p>sage, Rabban Yohanan ben Zakai proleptically hailed Vespasian as the king, since only </p>
<p>a king can destroy the Temple and he would be the very person to do so. He proceeded </p>
<p>to cite Isa 10:34 about the fall of Lebanon (= Temple) by a mighty one (= king). But it </p>
<p>takes a conceptual leap to think that this provides evidence that there was a belief of </p>
<p>the Messiah’s destroying the Temple. A more straightforward way of reading it is that </p>
<p>only an enemy with the status of king can destroy the Temple. All this may mean that </p>
<p>Mark 14:58 is unprecedented, and that it could very well have been concocted out of </p>
<p>sheer malice.</p>
