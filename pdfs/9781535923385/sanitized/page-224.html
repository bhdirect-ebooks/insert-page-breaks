<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>14:53–72206</p>
<p>In Mark’s narrative the strict sense of blasphemy is probably intend-</p>
<p>ed.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p> Jesus makes a claim that may be regarded as an aront to Jewish re-</p>
<p>ligious sensibilities. e whole Sanhedrin (see excursus) agrees that Jesus </p>
<p>should be sentenced to death (v. 64). Animosity which has been seething </p>
<p>is now expressed. Jesus is spat upon, insulted, and beaten in the manner </p>
<p>worthy of a despised criminal.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>Excursus: Sanhedrin</p>
<p>The term is actually borrowed from the Greek synedrion, which mean basi-</p>
<p>cally “council.” The term as used in the Jewish context has either a generic </p>
<p>or technical sense (i.e., it may loosely refer to any local council or speak </p>
<p>speciﬁcally of a supreme council that was located in Jerusalem [cf. the evi-</p>
<p>dence from Josephus Life of Josephus 386; Antiquities 20:216–17]). With </p>
<p>respect to the latter, there are keen scholarly debates on whether there were </p>
<p>in fact two great Sanhedrins: one led by the high priests and his aristocratic </p>
<p>colleagues that was political in nature, and the other that was dominated </p>
<p>by the Pharisees that was religious or halakhic in nature. Although it is </p>
<p>to be borne in mind that what we know about this institution comes from </p>
<p>post-70 sources (e.g., the Mishnah)—and we therefore cannot be certain </p>
<p>about its exact composition, structure, and function—we none the less side </p>
<p>with those scholars who posit that there was only one such Sanhedrin. The </p>
<p>chief reason being that what we know of ﬁrst-century realities dictates that </p>
<p>politics and religion, or the spiritual and the mundane, cannot be separated </p>
<p>into neat compartments. They were all intertwined. </p>
<p>In the present Markan context, the term is used restrictively and not </p>
<p>generically (i.e., it refers to the Great Sanhedrin [or Jerusalem Sanhedrin] </p>
<p>and not any local council [cf. 13:9]). This comprises around seventy to </p>
<p>seventy-two members, who met in the Chamber of Hewn Stone on the </p>
<p>Temple Mount.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p>After the two wars with Rome, the Great Sanhedrin was</p>
<p>superseded by the Beth Din (judicial court), which had charge over religious </p>
<p>or moral matters only.</p>
