<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>16:1–8222</p>
<p>transcriptional probability and intrinsic probability combine together to </p>
<p>point to the secondary status of these last twelve verses.</p>
<p>Accepting v. 8 as the end of the Markan text as we now have it may </p>
<p>solve the textual problem but it creates another. Endings are composed to </p>
<p>wrap things up: defusing potential contradictions and providing closure. </p>
<p>However, v. 8 ends with the description of the women’s fears, with no nar-</p>
<p>ration of their seeing Jesus raised or his restoring the disciples, which were </p>
<p>predictions he himself made. Could Mark end with loose ends untied?</p>
<p>Recently, scholars have used modern literary theories to argue that this </p>
<p>is indeed the intention: not to end with a damaging conclusion, but rather to </p>
<p>goad the readers to better discipleship by providing an open ending. ere </p>
<p>are many variations to such a proposal, but the common thread uniting </p>
<p>them may be summarized thus: Mark’s ending is meant to be ironical, and </p>
<p>even downright discouraging, in order to convey the message that the story </p>
<p>goes on in the lives of the readers. ey are really the people who are in the </p>
<p>position to fulll Jesus’ predictions and provide closure to Mark’s text.</p>
<p>218</p>
<p>e one problem with such theories is that it appears highly improb-</p>
<p>able ancient readers would detect this surreptitious message. Most ancient </p>
<p>tales are told with rather explicit conclusions so that their message gets </p>
<p>through without misunderstanding.</p>
<p>219</p>
<p>Furthermore, since it is mentioned</p>
<p>explicitly, and in a signicant way, that Jesus would restore his disciples aer </p>
<p>his resurrection (14:28; 16:7), the failure to give an account of this fulll-</p>
<p>ment, and the reporting instead that the women were afraid and told no </p>
<p>one appears to destroy Mark’s plot.</p>
<p>220</p>
<p>In other words, this is a case of having</p>
<p>contradictory developments introduced into the plot without resolution, </p>
<p>and not a simple one of leaving loose ends untied. To reiterate, such theories </p>
<p>are to be rejected because they are anachronistic and damaging to the plot.</p>

<p>available.</p>
<p>219. Magness 1986 has tried to defuse this strong objection. In our view, he has not </p>
<p>reckoned with the fact that Mark intends to tell a revolutionary tale that he hopes will </p>
<p>change the world. Such a message would not be easily accepted; the majority would </p>
<p>even ridicule it. is being the case, to leave an ending such as 16:8 amounts to com-</p>
<p>mitting something close to literary suicide, making the gospel even more laughable. In </p>
<p>other words, such creatively ambiguous stu, while laudable, is usually tried only when </p>
<p>a religion is institutionalized, but not during its nascent stages, or when it is ghting </p>
<p>for survival. Early Church history has more in common with the latter than the former. </p>
<p>Moreover, Mark shows fondness for adding editorial remarks at important junctures. </p>
<p>is is done for the very reason of preventing misunderstandings. See France 2002: </p>
<p>670–73 for similar objections.</p>

<p>221. Much discussion has revolved around whether a book can end with the Greek </p>
<p>conjunction gar, the nal word of Mark 16:8. In our view this is a red herring. We think </p>
