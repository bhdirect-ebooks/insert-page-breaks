<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>5:21–4368</p>
<p>aected by the bellicose ideas of much of Jewish messianism.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>Jesus bids</p>
<p>him to return to his family to testify to them but the man does this and </p>
<p>more, for he proclaims (cf. 1:14–15) to all and sundry in the Decapolis,</p>
<p>115</p>
<p> </p>
<p>causing amazement to many. Perhaps it is not too inaccurate to call this </p>
<p>unnamed person the rst apostle to the Gentiles.</p>
<p>Jairus’s Daughter and the Woman with Chronic Bleeding </p>
<p>(5:21–43)</p>
<p>We have here another ne example of intercalation in Mark’s Gospel (the </p>
<p>others are found in 3:20–35; 6:7–32; 11:12–26; 14:1–11; 14:54–72). e </p>
<p>story of the healing of the woman with a menstrual disorder is sandwiched </p>
<p>by the story of the raising of Jairus’s daughter.</p>
<p>Menstrual blood and death are regarded as rendering people ritually </p>
<p>impure, but Jesus overcomes this without being made impure, even though </p>
<p>he comes into contact with them. Hence, there is a thematic connection </p>
<p>with the healing of the Gerasene demoniac where there was extreme ritual </p>
<p>impurity. It must also be stressed that the theme of faith remains domi-</p>
<p>nant.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>In this regard, we may claim there is also a connection with the</p>
<p>miracle story in 4:35–41, where the theme of faith is prominent. We shall </p>
<p>explain how this theme is further developed in this passage.</p>
<p>e Humility of Faith: the Request of Jairus (5:21–24)</p>
<p>e story takes place on the Jewish side of the Sea of Galilee (i.e., aer Jesus </p>
<p>has returned from Gerasenes). Although a great crowd comes to Jesus (v. </p>
<p>21), the spotlight falls on Jairus (v. 22). Jairus is “one of the synagogue rul-</p>
<p>ers,” meaning that he is not the presider who has overall responsibility for </p>
<p>the synagogue, but a member of the body of elders that elects the presider.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He is certainly a man of high standing and means: his house has rooms (v. </p>
<p>40), the family can aord professional mourners (v. 38), and he probably has </p>
<p>servants too (v. 35).</p>

<p>115. e Decapolis (literally: ten cities) was part of the kingdom bequeathed to </p>
<p>Philip the Tetrarch, the brother of Herod Antipas. is is located to the east of the </p>
<p>Jordan River, beyond the Sea of Galilee, and is known for its Hellenistic culture. e </p>
<p>extant evidence seems to indicate the number is only nominal, and exactly what cit-</p>
<p>ies belonged to this region are not clearly dened (Pliny Natural History 6:18, 74; cf. </p>
<p>Josephus Life 341, 410).</p>
