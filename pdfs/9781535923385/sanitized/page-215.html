<p>Introduction to the Passion Narrative 197</p>
<p>kingdom (cf. Isa 25:6),</p>
<p>143</p>
<p>which also ushers in unprecedented blessings.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this statement has been interpreted as referring either to </p>
<p>Jesus’ abstinence from banqueting (i.e., during the interval framed by his </p>
<p>death and the consummation of the kingdom),</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>or to his expectation of</p>
<p>post-mortem survival and condence in the certain consummation of the </p>
<p>kingdom of God, in which he would play the central role.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>Both ideas are</p>
<p>not mutually exclusive. at said, there is a more profound dimension that </p>
<p>needs explication. First, the saying communicates to the disciples that Jesus’ </p>
<p>fellowship with them will be renewed. Jesus has spoken about his passion </p>
<p>many times. With this verse, he is saying that his death ends not in tragedy. </p>
<p>A greater fellowship awaits them instead: they will drink wine together again </p>
<p>in the kingdom of God. Secondly, this fellowship will be of a dierent order, </p>
<p>as it is indicated by the Greek word kainon. is points to the consumma-</p>
<p>tion of the kingdom. irdly, all this is meant to show the vindication of Je-</p>
<p>sus’ message and vocation. Reunion in a new mode at the consummation of </p>
<p>the kingdom certainly entails it. e kingdom’s program will not be derailed </p>
<p>by his death, but comes, in an inscrutable way, to fruition.</p>
<p>e Prediction of Peter’s Denial (14:27–31)</p>
<p>En route to the Mount of Olives, Jesus predicts abandonment by the Twelve </p>
<p>and Peter’s denial. is indicates that the theme of discipleship, so much a </p>
<p>part of the eschatological discourse of chapter 13 and the middle segment of </p>
<p>Mark, has not been forgotten.</p>
<p>Again, the initiative is with Jesus. e prediction is oered, without the </p>
<p>disciples’ asking for it. Coming aer the explanation of what Jesus’ impend-</p>
<p>ing death stands for, the prediction amounts to being a major disappoint-</p>
<p>ment for the disciples. Like the prediction of betrayal in 14:18, it is backed </p>
<p>up by Scripture (Zech 13:7). e book of Zechariah prophesies not just the </p>
<p>coming of a peaceable king, riding on a donkey, but also the mysterious </p>
<p>rejection of a shepherd close to God.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>Jesus may have connected these</p>
<p>themes together to speak of the fate of God’s chosen king. In this sense the </p>
<p>disciples’ defection is also foretold in Scripture, but that is not the end of </p>
<p>the story. Jesus moves on to predict his rising again (v. 28), which means </p>
<p>143. e so-called messianic banquet; see Boring 2006: 391; Evans 2001: 395.</p>
<p>144. Jeremias 1966a: 207–9.</p>
<p>145. Cf. de Jonge 1996: 265–86.</p>
<p>146. Zech 13:7 is also used in CD 19:7–13 in a similar way (sheep = adherents; </p>
<p>shepherd = Teacher of Righteousness).</p>
