<p>e Second Passion Prediction and Sundry Discipleship Lessons 129</p>
<p>e nal point is given in v. 41 and the thrust is similar. ose who re-</p>
<p>ally belong to Jesus need not be identied with a social or even action group. </p>
<p>So Jesus says anyone giving water to his disciples (in Greek it is plural, hy-</p>
<p>mas) in his name will not lose his reward. e qualier “because you belong </p>
<p>to Christ” is added for clarity.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Giving a cup of water to them in Jesus’ name</p>
<p>means recognizing that they belong to the Messiah. Such recognition in </p>
<p>the time of Jesus’ ministry and in the time of the rst-century Church is </p>
<p>explosively controversial, and might lead to ostracism. So that person who </p>
<p>gives only a cup of water—an activity understood as the least one can do to </p>
<p>help—will not lose his reward, even though he may not be directly involved </p>
<p>or identied with apostolic work or the preaching of the gospel. In Mark’s </p>
<p>Gospel, rewards to be given by God because of a connection with Jesus’ </p>
<p>ministry are always understood as things which pertain to the new age (cf. </p>
<p>10:28–30). So an activity which is understood as showing basic courtesy </p>
<p>when done in the name of Jesus redounds in great reward! is is a lesson </p>
<p>for the disciples who are tempted to think that only they will be rewarded </p>
<p>because of their special status as the chosen Twelve.</p>
<p>All the three reasons make this case: the disciples must abandon the </p>
<p>conventional understanding of group boundaries. Serving Jesus is not about </p>
<p>acquiring a franchise. Just as true greatness means being a servant of all in </p>
<p>Jesus’ name, it also involves having a largeness of heart that goes beyond </p>
<p>focusing on one’s in-group.</p>
<p>Not Causing the Little Ones to Stumble (9:42–50)</p>
<p>e sayings found in this passage appear abrupt. No indication of time and </p>
<p>place is given. Since the paragraph begins with the injunction not to trip up </p>
<p>the little ones who believe in Jesus, we must begin with deciphering their </p>
<p>identity.</p>
<p>It can be argued that “the little ones who believe in me” are connected </p>
<p>to those who cast out demons in Jesus’ name without being known by the </p>
<p>Twelve, or those who give a cup of water to them in Jesus name, in that </p>
<p>their connection with the Jesus’ movement appears slender to the human </p>
<p>eye. So preventing them from doing service in the name of Jesus or erecting </p>
<p>membership boundaries to protect the Twelve’s status amounts to “stum-</p>
<p>bling” them. at person who causes the stumbling is better o having a </p>
<p>large millstone tied round his neck and be thrown into the sea. e “large </p>
<p>35. is is the one clear instance that Jesus calls himself the Messiah in Mark’s Gos-</p>
<p>pel! Hence, it should put an end to any hypothesis that Peter’s confession of Jesus as </p>
<p>Messiah is rejected by Jesus.</p>
