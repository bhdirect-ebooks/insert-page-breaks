<p>e New People of God and Jesus’ True Family 49</p>
<p>e formula “Amen I say to you” (v. 28) appears to be unique to Jesus. </p>
<p>e word “amen” is Hebraic in origin and has as its root meaning “truth” or </p>
<p>“trustworthiness.” It is also used in Jewish liturgy as an armative response, </p>
<p>or at the end of a doxology (Deut 27:15–26; 1 Chron 16:36). e LXX trans-</p>
<p>lates the Hebrew ’āmēn as genoito, which means “let it be,” and thus many </p>
<p>understand the Hebrew term to mean “so be it.”</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>In the context of Jesus’</p>
<p>sayings, it means a solemn truth is being given, somewhat akin to “us </p>
<p>says the Lord.”</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>Jesus’ usage is unique in that the term is used to preface a</p>
<p>saying and not to conclude it. Some scholars have also regarded it as carry-</p>
<p>ing important christological freight.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>e scribal charge of blasphemy in 2:7 now rebounds to them (3:29–</p>
<p>30). In the Markan context the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit means an </p>
<p>outright rejection of Jesus’ ministry. is may be derived from the fact that </p>
<p>his ministry derives its power from the Holy Spirit, and its feature is the </p>
<p>exorcism of unclean spirits. Furthermore, the forgiveness of sins is oen </p>
<p>linked to the work of the Spirit in the eschaton (see excursus on “Blasphemy </p>
<p>against the Holy Spirit”).</p>
<p>e words “will never,” standing as a counterpart to “eternal sin” (v. </p>
<p>29), are a translation of the Greek eis ton aiōna, which is in turn derived </p>
<p>from the Hebrew lĕ‘ôlām. is Hebrew phrase refers to the age to come, </p>
<p>which may be associated with the consummation of history (i.e., the escha-</p>
<p>ton). rough the work of the Spirit in Jesus, the eschaton has proleptically </p>
<p>invaded the present age, without ending it. Hence, by rejecting Jesus’ minis-</p>
<p>try by assigning his exorcistic work to Satan, the scribes stand in danger of </p>
<p>committing an eschatological or eternal sin.</p>
<p>e scene reverts back to the rst story in v. 31, with the depiction of </p>
<p>the arrival of Jesus’ family. ere is something interesting about the com-</p>
<p>position of this family contingent, because the responsibility for reining in </p>
<p>or bringing home a wayward adult male member of the family usually rests </p>
<p>with males: either the father or the elder brother. In Jesus’ case, the mother </p>
<p>comes along with his brothers, suggesting that Joseph is probably dead or ill. </p>
<p>is also suggests that Jesus is the eldest son.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>If Jesus had an older brother,</p>
<p>the mother need not be present. But if Jesus is the eldest brother, the mother </p>
<p>has to be responsible if Joseph is not around, since younger brothers do not </p>
<p>have the authority to rein him in. eir coming along must be for the reason </p>
<p>that if the situation becomes ugly, they can then help their mother.</p>
