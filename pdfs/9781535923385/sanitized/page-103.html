<p>Miracles Around the Lake 85</p>
<p>raise up his shepherd (Num 27:7; 1 Kings 22:17; Ezek 34:5–16; Zech 13:7). </p>
<p>We should also note Mark’s emphasis that the event takes place in the wil-</p>
<p>derness (erēmos). is is mentioned thrice (vv. 31, 32, and 35). Indeed, this </p>
<p>detail is found only in Mark’s Gospel and not in the parallel accounts of the </p>
<p>other three Gospels. When all this is combined with the Jewish specula-</p>
<p>tion of a re-enactment of the manna miracle (2 Bar 29:8; Mekilta on Exod </p>
<p>16:5; cf. Rev 2:7), we have the components that make up the signicance </p>
<p>of this episode in Mark. Jesus is here presented as the messianic shepherd </p>
<p>who would lead the people on a greater Exodus, during which their needs </p>
<p>would be met in miraculous ways.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>e messianic aspect of this miracle,</p>
<p>while implicit in Mark, is clearly expressed in the Johannine account where </p>
<p>the crowd is described as seeking forcibly to make Jesus king (6:4–15). In </p>
<p>Mark’s hands, however, the story is told to emphasize the compassion of the </p>
<p>messianic shepherd.</p>
<p>e question is oen asked whether this episode also looks forward to </p>
<p>the Last Supper in which Jesus again takes bread, blesses and breaks it, and </p>
<p>distributes it to those partaking of the meal. In that later account, the Last </p>
<p>Supper is also presented as that which foreshadows the messianic banquet </p>
<p>to be served when the kingdom is consummated. All this means that while </p>
<p>Jesus now makes use of what has been oered to feed the crowd, he will later </p>
<p>oer himself to feed the world. e similar words used for Jesus’ action with </p>
<p>respect to the bread may support such a thesis. In both accounts (see 6:41 </p>
<p>and 14:22), there is a taking (lambanō), a blessing (eulogeō), a fragmenting </p>
<p>(kataklaō in 6:41, but klaō in 14:22) and a distributing (didōmi). Moreover, </p>
<p>the datum of the green grass points to spring, the season in which the Jewish </p>
<p>Passover is celebrated. Such an attractive hypothesis is not without its prob-</p>
<p>lems. First, the Passover connection of the feeding of the 5,000 is not explicit </p>
<p>(only John’s account in John 6:4 makes this plain). More importantly, Mark </p>
<p>says nothing of the multiplication of wine or drink, and the datum that sh </p>
<p>are also present does not quite square with a eucharistic symbolism. Finally, </p>
<p>the action of blessing and breaking of bread is commonplace: the head of a </p>
<p>household oen does this during mealtimes. As fascinating as the sugges-</p>
<p>tion may be, it is unclear whether Mark intends it to be understood in this </p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>153. It should be noted that Pss Sol 16.23–46 presents the Messiah as a shepherd.</p>
