<p>e Kingdom in Parables 53</p>
<p>better with the theme of vv. 10–12. irdly, they develop the theme of vv. </p>
<p>10–12 further by stating that there will be illumination and revelation even-</p>
<p>tually (i.e., all “hiddenness” will ultimately end because the lamp comes for </p>
<p>the purpose of illumination). is gives the christological resolution to the </p>
<p>paradoxical kingdom, and promises that all things will nally be made clear.</p>
<p>In short, we have an ABA’B’ structure for vv. 3–25 (see Diagram 3). </p>
<p>e archetypal parable is taught in vv. 3–9 (A), followed by comments on </p>
<p>the concealing function of parables in vv. 10–12 (B). Next, the explana-</p>
<p>tion of the archetype parable is given in vv. 13–20 (A’), and this is then </p>
<p>followed by sayings on concealment and revelation in vv. 21–25 (B’). Mark </p>
<p>then includes two further seed parables to illustrate the hidden nature of </p>
<p>the kingdom (vv. 26–32). No interpretation from Jesus is provided for them, </p>
<p>probably because Mark regards this as unnecessary once the meaning of </p>
<p>the Parable of the Sower has been explained, and Jesus’ role in all this is </p>
<p>understood. Of course, in the summary Mark reiterates that Jesus typically </p>
<p>explains the parables to his disciples (vv. 33–34). </p>

<p>Two More Seed Parables (vv. 26-32) </p>
<p>Parable of Growing Seed (vv. 26-29) </p>
<p>Parable of Mustard Seed (vv. 30-32) </p>
<p>The Parable of the Sower and Its Interpretation (4:3-25) </p>

<p>Telling the Parable (vv. 3-9) </p>
<p>The kingdom is likened to seed sown, which engenders different responses </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Concealment and Disclosure (vv. 10-12) </p>
<p>The theological explanation: restorative word is at work but obduracy is not removed </p>

<p>Decoding the Elements of the Parable (vv. 13-20) </p>

<p>Eventual Elimination of Concealment (vv. 21-25) </p>
<p>The Christological resolution: the lamp must shine, all things will be made clear </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>All the above then raises a pressing question: why does Mark choose only </p>
<p>seed parables to explain what the kingdom is? We may think of three </p>
