<p>Redening the Unclean 91</p>
<p>What would washing hands with a st mean? Not surprisingly, some Greek </p>
<p>manuscripts either omit the word, or substitute it with the similar sounding </p>
<p>pykna, which means “oen” or “thoroughly.” e latter is rightly regarded </p>
<p>by many scholars as a secondary reading, introduced into the manuscript </p>
<p>tradition to solve a diculty. So if pygmē is the original reading, what does </p>
<p>it mean? One proposal is that it refers to a washing that was done up to the </p>
<p>wrist (i.e., the st may be taken to extend up to the wrist), and m. Yad. 2.3 </p>
<p>pronounces that the hands are rendered clean by the pouring of water over </p>
<p>them up to the wrist. Another possibility is to interpret the word as referring </p>
<p>to a stful of water that was used in ceremonial washing (see m. Yad. 1.1). </p>
<p>And nally, it has been suggested that what is meant is attested in modern </p>
<p>Jewish practice: washing the hands while they are in a cupped shape. What-</p>
<p>ever its meaning, what is clear is that it is performed for ceremonial reason, </p>
<p>and with this we must be content.</p>
<p>e charge made is that the disciples did not follow the tradition of </p>
<p>the elders (v. 5). is tradition is a result of interpretation of texts that has </p>
<p>developed, discussed and tested over the many years of study and practice </p>
<p>of Torah (cf. Josephus Antiquities 13:297). One of its goals may be described </p>
<p>as “fencing” the Torah (i.e., creating a buer zone between the explicit re-</p>
<p>quirements of Torah and day-to-day practice), such that if the elements of </p>
<p>the tradition were observed, transgression of Torah would denitely be pre-</p>
<p>vented (m. Abot 1.1). In this particular instance, the Torah regulation which </p>
<p>is most directly relevant is that which commands the priests ceremonially </p>
<p>to wash their hands before oering sacrices (Exod 30:18–21; 40:30–32). </p>
<p>e extension of this principle to the laity—to cover all foods consumed, </p>
<p>and not just sacrices made to God—was a later scribal development in the </p>
<p>interest of making all Israelites as pure as the priests.</p>
<p>165</p>
<p>Purity formed a key</p>
<p>component of the agenda of the Pharisees, which was connected with their </p>
<p>expectation that God would mercifully come to the plight of the nation and </p>
<p>deliver her from her enemies.</p>
<p>Excursus: Food and the Tradition of the Elders</p>
<p>Eating common food with unwashed hands does not contradict the Torah. </p>
<p>Mark does not negate this principle but states instead that it contradicts </p>
<p>the tradition of the elders. What causes difﬁculty for biblical scholars is </p>
<p>that there is no evidence for such a tradition in the Mishnah. Indeed what is </p>
<p>made clear in is that common hands could not communicate deﬁlement to </p>
<p>165. Neusner 1973: 80.</p>
