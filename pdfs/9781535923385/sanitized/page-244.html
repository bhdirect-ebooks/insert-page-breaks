<p>A Sketch of Mark’s Theology</p>
<p>Mark announces his primary subject matter at the very start. Two items are </p>
<p>mentioned: the Messiah Jesus, (also known as the Son of God, if the longer </p>
<p>text is followed), and the gospel. What is not mentioned in this announce-</p>
<p>ment, but is implied and would be given prominence in the tale, is that the </p>
<p>Messiah’s proclamation of the gospel through word and deed produces a </p>
<p>people. e following nexus of ideas is then obtained: Messiah—Gospel—</p>
<p>People. However, this gospel is the gospel of the kingdom (1:15). So the </p>
<p>nexus may be modied thus: Messiah—Gospel/Kingdom—People. What </p>
<p>follows is a brief sketch of the themes of this nexus; supporting arguments </p>
<p>for the elements of this nexus may be found in the comments of the relevant </p>
<p>passages.</p>
<p>Christology</p>
<p>Since Jesus is the central character of Mark’s narrative, any discussion of the </p>
<p>thought of Mark must start with Christology (i.e., how Jesus is presented). </p>
<p>Indeed, as Boring observes, Christology is the book’s generative and driving </p>
<p>force.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>e character of Jesus is eshed out with recourse mainly to the </p>
<p>OT.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>All other traditions, notions or cultural mores, even when they are</p>
<p>promoted by a mighty Empire, pale before this. e OT is treated as an au-</p>
<p>thoritative tradition, which contains in itself an open-ended narrative that </p>
<p>needs completion (1:2–3; 1:11; 10:45; 12:10–11; 14:27; 14:49). It also reveals </p>
<p>the pattern of God’s action in the world, and speaks of promises that need </p>
<p>to be fullled. If there is a sensus plenior to this tradition, Jesus is regarded </p>
<p>as the sensus plenus. at said, the OT’s central character is Yahweh, and </p>
<p>we therefore should expect the portrayal of Jesus to be related to him. And </p>
<p>indeed, this is what we nd.</p>

<p>2. e key scriptural books are the Pentateuch, Isaiah, Daniel, Psalms and Zecha-</p>
<p>riah. Scriptures are mined, juxtaposed and utilized creatively to esh out Jesus’ identity </p>
<p>(see comments in 1:14–15; 10:45; 11:1–11; 12:1–37; 14:27). See the informative sum-</p>
<p>mary of Boring 2006: 404–8.</p>
