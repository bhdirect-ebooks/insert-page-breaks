<p>Introduction2</p>
<p>Moreover, Mark is not the name of an apostle, or an important gure </p>
<p>in the history of earliest Christianity. Why should a rather obscure name be </p>
<p>passed o as the author of this important work, when there were better can-</p>
<p>didates? Indeed, the two-document hypothesis</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> adds strength to this argu-</p>
<p>ment, as it means our Gospel was signicant enough to be utilized by both </p>
<p>Matthew and Luke. If a name has to be fabricated to identify a signicant </p>
<p>anonymous work, we would not have expected “Mark.” e name “Mark” </p>
<p>therefore carries with it a ring of authenticity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, written Gospels started circulating as early as the rst </p>
<p>century. We may use John’s Gospel as an illuminating example. is work </p>
<p>was already being copied in Egypt by AD 125,</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>a mere thirty years or so aer</p>
<p>its composition, which is usually believed to be in Ephesus. Although we do </p>
<p>not have similar evidence in the case of the Second Gospel, we may posit </p>
<p>that it must have started circulating in the rst century, since it was used by </p>
<p>Matthew and Luke. Early circulation of Gospels necessitated some sort of </p>
<p>labelling, so as to distinguish the one from the other.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>All the above observations mean that even if the Second Gospel was </p>
<p>published anonymously, this anonymity would have disappeared almost </p>
<p>from the very start, when it started circulating. In other words, even if we </p>
<p>deem the superscriptions as secondary, we will still have to accept that they </p>
<p>may very well have enshrined a truth. Signicantly, there is only one name </p>
<p>oered by them as the author: Mark. </p>
<p>Early Patristic Testimonies</p>
<p>e earliest and most-discussed testimony comes from Papias, the bishop </p>
<p>of Hierapolis in the early second century. His work, Exegesis of the Lord’s </p>
<p>Oracles, was written around AD 110,</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>but it is now lost except for excerpts</p>
<p>that are cited in Eusebius’s book, Ecclesiastical History, written in the fourth </p>
<p>century. Papias testies that Mark wrote the “oracles of the Lord,” dependent </p>
<p>on Peter’s memories.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Of course, this does not necessarily mean that our</p>
<p>current Gospel is being referred to. at said, it is clear that as early as the </p>
<p>7. e hypothesis that Mark and a source known as Q are the key sources used by </p>
<p>Matthew and Luke.</p>

<p>10. Bauckham 2008: 13–14; Gundry 1993: 1027–29, thinks it is even earlier: AD </p>
<p>101–108.</p>
