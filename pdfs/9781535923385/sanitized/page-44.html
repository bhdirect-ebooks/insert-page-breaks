<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>1:16–4526</p>
<p>and John together form the inner circle, and become the privileged audi-</p>
<p>ence of Jesus’ special miracles and revelation (5:37; 9:2; 14:33).</p>
<p>Jesus’ Teaching and Miracles (1:21–34)</p>
<p>Mark introduces his readers to yet another important locality in Jesus’ Gali-</p>
<p>lean ministry: Capernaum (v. 21). e name in Hebrew means “village of </p>
<p>Nahum.” According to Josephus, it was prosperous and had a thriving sh-</p>
<p>ing industry (War 3:516–21). is explains why a toll-booth was set up in its </p>
<p>vicinity (2:1; 14). A detachment of Roman troops was also stationed there </p>
<p>(cf. Matt 8:5–13), further indicating its importance. It was also Peter and </p>
<p>Andrew’s village (1:29), and probably the center of Jesus’ Galilean ministry </p>
<p>(see 2:1; 9:33; Matt 8:5–17 || Luke 7:1–10).</p>
<p>e rst miracle story of Mark takes place on a Sabbath and it con-</p>
<p>cerns both word and deed: these are described as being performed with </p>
<p>unrivalled authority (vv. 22, 27). e comparison with the scribes to the </p>
<p>latter’s detriment prepares Mark’s readers for more stories about the conict </p>
<p>between Jesus and the scribes later on (2:6, 16; 11:27).</p>
<p>e appearance of a demon-possessed man in the synagogue (v. 23) </p>
<p>sets the stage for the introduction of one hallmark of Jesus’ ministry: his </p>
<p>exorcistic work. ree other accounts of exorcism are given in 5:1–20; 7:24–</p>
<p>30; and 9:14–29. Mention of such an activity is also found in summaries or </p>
<p>general reports such as 1:32–34; 1:39; 3:11–12, and in the Beelzeboul con-</p>
<p>troversy of 3:22–30. All this indicates how important the motif is. Although </p>
<p>there was much interest in exorcism in the Mediterranean world around the </p>
<p>time of Jesus, there were actually very few exorcistic narratives available and </p>
<p>very few exorcists named.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>is scarcity throws into bold relief the frequent</p>
<p>depiction of Jesus as an exorcist.</p>
<p>Exorcistic practices of Jesus’ day are oen referred to by scholars for </p>
<p>understanding better his exorcism. Accordingly, the mention of Jesus’ iden-</p>
<p>tity (v. 24) is construed as the demon’s attempt to gain power over him, </p>
<p>and Jesus’ silencing word (v. 25) becomes his countermove to regain the </p>
<p>initiative.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>As interesting as such parallels may be, they fail to explain what</p>
<p>Mark is doing. In all his exorcism stories there is no power struggle but the </p>
<p>simple giving of a command, uncluttered by techniques or incantations. e </p>
<p>8. Apollonius (Philostratus Life of Apollonius 1:3–5, 19); Eleazar (Josephus An-</p>
<p>tiquities 8:45–48) and possibly Hanina ben Dosa (b. Pesah. 112b). Solomon was also </p>
<p>regarded by some as an exorcist. See discussion in Witmer 2012: 22–60.</p>
