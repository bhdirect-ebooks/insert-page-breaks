<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>3:13–4548</p>

<p>at which intercalates completes the meaning of that which</p>
<p>is intercalated by explicating the deeper issue. In this case it is about the true </p>
<p>members of Jesus’ family, or God’s family (v. 35). e intercalation is not </p>
<p>articial because in both incidents, Jesus was labelled. e family labels him </p>
<p>mad while the scribes from Jerusalem label him demon-possessed. Demon-</p>
<p>possessed people were also regarded as mad in antiquity (John 10:20).</p>
<p>e setting is in a house, a place where much of Jesus’ teaching is given. </p>
<p>Jesus’ family</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>comes to restrain him. In good ancient Semitic tradition, the</p>
<p>family assumes responsibility for the disciplining of a wayward or deviant </p>
<p>son, even if he is already grown up. Moreover, this is done to protect the </p>
<p>family’s honor. All this means Jesus’ teaching, deeds, and claims must have </p>
<p>been quite shocking to his peers.</p>
<p>e scene changes with v. 22, and some scribes from Jerusalem accuse </p>
<p>Jesus of being possessed by Beelzeboul. e meaning of this term is un-</p>
<p>certain although “lord of the house” or “lord of the heavenly abode” seems </p>
<p>most cogent. In any case, in so charging Jesus the scribes tacitly agree that </p>
<p>Jesus’ ministry has been characterized by extraordinarily authoritative ex-</p>
<p>orcisms, since the alleged power behind his work is attributed to no less a </p>
<p>gure than the prince of demons.</p>
<p>Jesus responds in “parables” (v. 23). is is the rst time the Greek </p>
<p>parabolē is used in Mark’s Gospel. e concept takes aer the Hebrew </p>
<p>māšāl, which means basically “dark saying,” in contrast to the Greek which </p>
<p>speaks of a comparison. Nevertheless, their semantic domains do overlap. </p>
<p>Given that the story is set in Palestine, it is best to understanding it accord-</p>
<p>ing to the Semitic way. Being inherently loose in semantic boundaries, the </p>
<p>term may refer to pithy sayings or even extended narratives in which some </p>
<p>comparison is made and an encrypted message given. So we must avoid </p>
<p>prejudging the meaning of Jesus’ message based merely on some denition </p>
<p>of what a parable should be. How Jesus uses it to convey his message in a </p>
<p>particular text should be the main guide to interpretation.</p>
<p>e parables make two comparisons, using the images of kingdom</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and house (vv. 24–27). eir purpose is to show the logic of the accusation </p>
to be absurd. If there is civil war or internecine division, a kingdom or a
<p>household cannot stand. What Jesus hopes to convey is that his exorcisms </p>
<p>indicate an invasion of Satan’s kingdom and not an internal revolt.</p>

<p>70. On the plausibility of construing the Greek hoi par’ autou to mean “family,” see </p>
<p>Collins 2007: 226; and France 2002: 166.</p>
<p>71. Aer the ground-breaking announcement of Jesus in 1:15 regarding the im-</p>
<p>minence of the kingdom, the word “kingdom” is not used again until 3:24, where it </p>
<p>occurs twice.</p>
