<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>2:1—3:640</p>
<p>e background claries why Jesus chooses the wedding metaphor. </p>
<p>e point is that, through his ministry, the long-anticipated climax of God’s </p>
<p>relationship with Israel has now come to pass. It is possible that the bride-</p>
<p>groom refers to Jesus.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>What is notable is that there is no evidence of the</p>
<p>Messiah’s being described as the bridegroom in Jewish literature before the </p>
<p>sixth century AD (the rst attestation is found in Pesiq. R. 37:2).</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>Hence,</p>
<p>the metaphor is not messianic. Instead, it implies that Jesus puts himself on </p>
<p>par with the one God of Israel.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>What would the departure of the bridegroom mean (v. 20)? Clearly, </p>
<p>it signals the end of festivity. What event is envisaged as corresponding to </p>
<p>it? Usually this is believed to be Jesus’ departure, which would reintroduce </p>
<p>the practice of fasting for his followers. It is equally possible, however, that </p>
it refers to divine abandonment, if we bear in mind the rich meaning of the
<p>nuptial metaphor in the OT. Being Jews, the disciples will share in the pain </p>
<p>of the nation of Israel. e one possible event that is being referred to would </p>
<p>be the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70. Perhaps the originator of this </p>
<p>saying intentionally kept it ambiguous.</p>
<p>e nuptial metaphor is followed by two pictures that speak of incom-</p>
<p>patibility (vv. 21–22). New cloth in ancient times was unshrunk, unlike old </p>
<p>cloth which had been shrunk through repeated washings. Patching an old </p>
<p>garment with new cloth only adds to the problem. is notion of incom-</p>
<p>patibility extends to wineskins. New wine is still fermenting and produces </p>
<p>carbon dioxide. is causes the wineskins to swell. New wineskins can take </p>
<p>this pressure but not old wineskins because they have become brittle with </p>
<p>age. So this centerpiece in the collection of ve controversy stories points </p>
<p>out the incompatibility of old practices with the arrival of the new. As such, </p>
<p>it hints at what the real issue is between the religious authorities and Jesus: </p>
<p>whether they would accept that the new or eschatological has come in Jesus’ </p>
<p>ministry.</p>
<p>Plucking Grain on a Sabbath (2:23–28)</p>
<p>With the fourth controversy story, a new issue is presented, which is about </p>
<p>the Sabbath. e occasion is the plucking of grain by Jesus’ disciples to sat-</p>
<p>isfy their hunger (v. 23). e Pharisees regard the disciples’ action as work </p>
<p>(v. 24), and this sparks a controversy between them and Jesus. Jesus defends </p>
