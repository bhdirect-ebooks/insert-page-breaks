<p>e Stuttering Beginnings of True Perception 111</p>
<p>e distance from Bethsaida to Caesarea Philippi was about twenty-</p>
<p>ve miles. As the distance is quite considerable for one on foot, it implies </p>
<p>that the place was chosen by Jesus because of its signicance. Perhaps this </p>
<p>was done to ensure some condentiality for what he would be revealing to </p>
<p>his disciples because messiahship is oen linked to bellicose ideas in the </p>
<p>Jewish context. Another possibility is that it was chosen to subvert the Em-</p>
<p>pire’s propaganda. To confess Jesus as Messiah at such a place was to chal-</p>
<p>lenge the propaganda that deliverance came from the Caesars of the Empire.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Mark describes Jesus’ questions as being posed “on the </p>
<p>way.” e Greek phrase en tē hodō is used frequently in chapters 8–10 and </p>
<p>may be thus regarded as a sort of technical term. e way Jesus is taking </p>
<p>leads towards Jerusalem, where he would be crucied. Hence, it may also be </p>
<p>regarded as the way of the cross. Along this way many lessons of disciple-</p>
<p>ship are given, signifying that the way of the cross is also the way of disciple-</p>
<p>ship. is further implies that rejecting the cross (i.e., its meaning for Jesus, </p>
the Christian movement and the divine redemptive program), means also
<p>rejecting discipleship. Do also note that Jesus’ identity is asked “on the way,” </p>
<p>implying that Jesus’ identity, the cross, and discipleship are all bound up </p>
<p>together. Much, therefore, is at stake here.</p>
<p>e popular answers that the disciples volunteer (vv. 28–29) all belong </p>
<p>to one category: the prophetic. ey were previously mentioned in 6:14–16. </p>
<p>It seems Jesus was better known in his day as a prophet than as the Mes-</p>
<p>siah. However, Jesus’ question in v. 29 indicates the popular answers are not </p>
<p>adequate. At the same time, he wants personal answers. In the Greek text </p>
<p>the word “you” comes rst in the sentence for emphasis. What the disciples </p>
<p>think of Jesus should not be dependent on the crowds.</p>
<p>Peter calls Jesus the Christ (v. 29). e word “Christ” is the Greek </p>
<p>form of the Hebrew “Messiah.” On the meaning of this word, see our earlier </p>
<p>discussion of 1:1. Many Jewish writings give evidence that Jews awaited a </p>
<p>kingly Messiah, from the line of David, to ght wars for Israel and eliminate </p>
<p>her enemies. is would usher in an age of glory for Israel, and certainly for </p>
<p>the pious and righteous within her (see Pss Sol 17; CD 19:10–11; 4Q252 and </p>
<p>1QM 4:13; 14:4–8).</p>
<p>Peter’s confession is therefore momentous. It shows that for the rst </p>
<p>time one of Jesus’ disciples grasps his true identity. However, Mark uses a </p>
<p>strong word to describe Jesus’ response. e Greek epitimaō means literally </p>
<p>rebuking or scolding (v. 30). is prompts an important question: is Peter’s </p>
<p>response rejected by Jesus?</p>
<p>If we look back at the instances where Jesus silences confessions, we will </p>
<p>discover such confessions are usually on target even if the timing is wrong. </p>
<p>e case here is similar. Peter’s confession is not wrong. It demonstrates that </p>
