<p>Excursus: e Chronology of the Last Supper in the Four Gospels192</p>
<p>Option (1) makes recourse to the Qumran community that peculiarly </p>
<p>followed the solar calendar instead of a lunar one, giving rise to the possibil-</p>
<p>ity that they might have celebrated the Passover on a different day. However, </p>
<p>it is dubious to regard the majority of the Jews as taking cognizance of the </p>
<p>issue, or even considering it as important.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>Option (2) sacriﬁces John to</p>
<p>save the Synoptic Gospels, and militates against the early evidence that </p>
<p>Jesus was understood as the Passover Lamb even in the Pauline churches </p>
<p>(1 Cor 5:7). Indeed, the rabbinic tradition has it that Jesus died on the </p>
<p>eve of Passover (b. Sanh. 43a; cf. 67a). Similarly, option (3) requires a </p>
<p>hypothesis that assumes a blunder in the Early Church, and it is not neces-</p>
<p>sary if option (4) or (2) can be sustained. Much may be said for option </p>
<p>(4), especially the theory that Jesus intended to celebrate the Passover in </p>
<p>advance. The following are the considerations.</p>
<p>1. The term “Passover” looms large in the ﬁrst half of Mark 14. Verses </p>
<p>12, 14, and 16 clearly indicate that the meal to be eaten is the Passover </p>
<p>meal.</p>
<p>2. The meal is eaten in Jerusalem and not at Bethany, where Jesus </p>
<p>is hosted. Having the meal in Jerusalem runs the risk of being spotted </p>
<p>and arrested. There is no need for this unless the location for the meal is </p>
<p>important. Passover meals are customarily eaten in Jerusalem (Deut 16:2; </p>
<p>m. Pesah. 7:9).</p>
<p>3. Jesus acts as the presider of the meal and speaks words of interpre-</p>
<p>tation over the different elements of the meal. This dovetails with the liturgy </p>
<p>performed at Passover meals.</p>
<p>4. The singing of the Hallel Psalms forms part of the Passover liturgy. </p>
<p>The singing of a hymn to conclude the meal at v. 26 ﬁts reasonably with </p>
<p>such a liturgy.</p>
<p>5. The failure to mention the Passover lamb may speak against this </p>
<p>theory, but there is a good explanation for this omission.</p>
<p>The Markan evidence does not tell us clearly whether the meal is held </p>
<p>on the ofﬁcial day itself or a day before it. It has been plausibly suggested </p>
<p>by France that the question about the Passover preparation could have been </p>
<p>asked on the beginning of 14th of Nisan (i.e., in the evening), which is </p>
<p>followed by the meal immediately (i.e., during the night, but still part of </p>
<p>the 14th of Nisan).</p>
<p>135</p>
<p>This means no lamb is mentioned because it cannot</p>
<p>be obtained, as (i.e., on the afternoon of the next solar day but it is still </p>
<p>134. But note Saulnier 2012 for a recent attempt to defend Jaubert’s thesis.</p>
<p>135. France 2002: 559–63. Jews began the day with the evening.</p>
