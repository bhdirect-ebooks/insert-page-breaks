<p>Introduction 9</p>
<p>we must consider an important datum oen missed by scholars emphasiz-</p>
<p>ing that Mark’s Gospel is written for oral presentation.</p>
<p>In Mark 13:14, Mark inserts his editorial remark “let the reader under-</p>
<p>stand.” is directive to the reader is important for our consideration of the </p>
<p>kind of text Mark’s Gospel is. If Mark were written merely for oral presenta-</p>
<p>tion, we should expect the remark to be “let the listener understand.” e </p>
<p>fact that the reader is alerted, without giving him explicit clues as to the </p>
<p>meaning of the abomination of desolation, implies that this reader is no </p>
<p>ordinary reader but someone who has been trained. He could then be ex-</p>
<p>pected to explain to the audience the meaning of v. 14. is certainly means </p>
<p>he is also expected to explain or clarify Mark’s teaching to the audience.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mark’s text is too long for a one-sitting reading. A reader </p>
<p>must know the appropriate points to stop his reading. He must be guided by </p>
<p>the contents, rather than by length. us we should expect a clear structure </p>
<p>to be found and clear indications of breaks in the text.</p>
<p>If the above conjectures are correct, an important rider must be added </p>
<p>to the valid concept of the Gospel of Mark being written for oral presen-</p>
<p>tation. It is a bios, written for oral presentation by an informed or trained </p>
<p>reader, who has the duty to study his text so he knows where to stop the </p>
<p>reading for the day, and so he can prepare himself to explain certain aspects </p>
<p>of it to his audience. erefore, we must allow for some sophistication to </p>
<p>Mark’s Gospel, even if the structure is straightforwardly simple.</p>
<p>We can now present a proposed structure for it. We argued earlier for </p>
<p>a structure that is clear and simple. Two cues are provided at the beginning </p>
<p>and at the end respectively. First, Mark has announced his primary subject </p>
<p>matter right at the start—the gospel of Messiah Jesus—and this must guide </p>
<p>us in our construal of the structure. e second is obtained by consider-</p>
<p>ing the sort of denouement Mark has adopted for his narrative. Scanning </p>
<p>through the text, one observes that the Passion narrative takes on a promi-</p>
<p>nent role. Moreover, Mark narrates only one trip of Jesus to Jerusalem, </p>
<p>which is a climactic and fateful one. Of course, Jesus would have made many </p>
<p>trips to that city, historically speaking. So Mark’s narration of only one trip </p>
<p>indicates to us where his narrative emphasis is, and what sort of structure </p>
<p>he is adopting. It describes the progression of Jesus’ gospel ministry, using </p>
<p>a geographical approach that is easily remembered: beginning with Galilee </p>
<p>and ending with Jerusalem.</p>
