<p>More Revolutionary Values for Disciples 135</p>
<p>married woman has an extra-marital aair, she has not wronged the wife </p>
<p>of the man she slept with, but only her own husband. In contrast to all this, </p>
<p>Jesus teaches that the wife can also be sinned against. He is using the origi-</p>
<p>nal principle of marriage that the two shall be one to derive the teaching </p>
<p>that marriage is not only for the man but also for the woman. is is indeed </p>
<p>radical and ground-breaking in his society. No Jewish rabbi or teacher in his </p>
<p>time or before it has ever made such a pronouncement.</p>
<p>41</p>
Jesus goes even further. Remarrying someone aer a divorce is con-strued as committing adultery against the divorced spouse. Why should
<p>this be the case? is is unthinkable in today’s society and not surprisingly, </p>
<p>a matter without consensus in NT scholarship.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>Constraints of time and</p>
<p>space do not aord us a detailed discussion of the matter. Suce it here to </p>
<p>point out that Jesus’ pronouncement in vv. 11–12 is derived from the rst </p>
<p>principles he has expounded earlier. is means the one esh union is still </p>
at work even aer a divorce, which implies that all divorces, including those
<p>legitimated by human institutions, cannot break the marital bond in the </p>
eyes of God. So if a man were to marry again aer a divorce, he would be
<p>committing adultery against his original spouse. e same applies also to a </p>
<p>woman. An inference to be drawn from this is that Jesus commands mo-</p>
<p>nogamy. If polygamy is allowed, talk of committing adultery against one’s </p>
<p>wife makes no sense. Not surprisingly, such a radical pronouncement of </p>
<p>Jesus is qualied by explanatory remarks by other early Christian writers </p>
<p>in the interest of clarifying or soening,</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>which we are unable to discuss in</p>
<p>this commentary.</p>
<p>Little Children and the Kingdom (10:13–16)</p>
<p>is short story eshes out the essence of the kingdom by connecting it </p>
<p>to little children, a motif encountered before (9:33–37). Mark describes </p>
<p>Jesus’ response to the disciples’ hindrance of the children with the Greek </p>
<p>aganakteō. is word speaks of irritation and repugnance, and it occurs once </p>
<p>only in Mark’s Gospel. It shows how gravely wrong the disciples’ hindrance </p>
<p>of children is. Why should an action performed in the interest of giving </p>
<p>their Master some respite be greeted with such displeasure? e reason lies </p>
<p>in vv. 14–15, and it is that children are somehow connected to the kingdom </p>
<p>of God. First, the kingdom of God belongs to them. e second arises from </p>
<p>41. Marcus 2009: 711–13.</p>
<p>42. See the helpful discussion in Stein 1979: 115–21.</p>
<p>43. e exception clauses in Matthew and the directives of Paul. On the latter, see </p>
<p>Wong 2002: 181–94.</p>
