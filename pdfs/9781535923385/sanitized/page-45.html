<p>e Gospel in Action and Typical Activities of Jesus’ Ministry 27</p>
<p>exclamation of the crowds that his teaching (i.e., shown by exorcism) is new </p>
<p>and authoritative (v. 27), says just as much.</p>
<p>Jesus is addressed as “the Holy One of God” (v. 24). A similar title is </p>
<p>used in the OT for Aaron (Ps 106:16), Elisha (2 Kings 4:9), and possibly </p>
<p>Samson (a variant reading of Judg 16:17 in the LXX). Judging from these </p>
<p>occurrences, the title’s meaning may simply be that a certain person has </p>
<p>been set apart for some special ministry. But Mark’s portrayal of Jesus, while </p>
<p>certainly containing this notion, also goes beyond it. He shows how Jesus, as </p>
<p>the bearer of the Holy Spirit, drives out uncleanness. In this respect, it may </p>
<p>be instructive to note the passages in the Dead Sea Scrolls that speak of the </p>
<p>eschatological elimination of ritual impurity by “the holy Messiah” (1Q30) </p>
<p>and by God’s holy Spirit (1QS 4:18–23). is testies to the Jewish belief </p>
<p>that only at the eschaton can all forms of uncleanness be rooted out of Israel </p>
<p>by an agent of God who bears the Spirit.</p>
<p>ere are some other signicant points that bear mentioning so as to </p>
<p>complete this Markan motif. e rst is that Mark usually describes the de-</p>
<p>mons as unclean (pneumata akatharta), indicating what sort of framework </p>
<p>we are to use to understand these stories. e issue of ritual uncleanness </p>
<p>looms large in Mark’s Gospel (1:40–45; 6:25–34; 7:1–23). Ritual unclean-</p>
<p>ness separates the aected from the corporate life of the nation of Israel. </p>
<p>In the case of demon possession, not only is the person unclean, he is also </p>
<p>controlled by what is antagonistic to God. Hence, being exorcised meant </p>
<p>that he was liberated to belong to God and to participate in the corporate </p>
<p>life of his people.</p>
<p>Secondly, the exorcism leads the crowd to exclaim that Jesus has </p>
<p>taught with authority (v. 27). is signies that Jesus’ activities of teaching </p>
and exorcism cannot be divorced from each other, as his word and deed are
<p>intimately related. His exorcism is in a profound sense also his teaching.</p>
<p>irdly, it is the exorcism that leads the crowd to introduce the ad-</p>
<p>jective “new” to describe Jesus’ teaching with authority. e word “new” is </p>
<p>signicant, as it points to eschatological newness. e demons’ fear of being </p>
<p>destroyed supports this proposal, as it shows they do not regard Jesus as any </p>
<p>ordinary exorcist. Early Jewish and Rabbinic thought locates the destruc-</p>
<p>tion of demons at the eschaton (see Pesiq. R. 36:1 where the agent is the </p>
<p>Messiah; Num. Rab. 19.8; cf. Zech 13.2). is ts in with the eschatological </p>
<p>horizon of Jesus’ gospel proclamation (1:15), with the added implication </p>
<p>that the kingdom of God has invaded the territories long held by demonic </p>
<p>forces. ere is therefore a Markan escalation in the two confessions of the </p>
<p>crowds (1:22; 1:27) which incidentally forms an inclusio (bracket).</p>
<p>Fourthly, the authority by which Jesus performs exorcisms is abso-</p>
<p>lute. is was mentioned earlier but it bears repeating. Jesus does not use </p>
