<p>of rhetorical counterpart to the “sinners.” It does not suggest Jesus thinks </p>
<p>the Pharisees are really righteous.</p>

<p>Incompatibility between the Old and the New (2:18–22)</p>
<p>Being the centerpiece of the collection of ve controversy stories, the story </p>
<p>contains the explanation of the key issue between Jesus and the religious au-</p>
<p>thorities. e feasting theme is still maintained (as it is in the second story) </p>
<p>through the implicit reference to a wedding banquet (v. 19). Jesus disciples’ </p>
<p>lack of fasting sets them in contrast with the Pharisees and the disciples of </p>
<p>John the Baptist, and this engendered a controversy.</p>
<p>e only fast prescribed in the Torah is connected with Yom Kippur or </p>
<p>the Day of Atonement (Lev 16:29–31; 23:26–29). By the post-exilic period, </p>
<p>a few other fasts were added to the national calendar (cf. Esth 9:31; Zech </p>
8:19). Individuals might choose to fast whenever they deemed it necessary,
<p>such as to show piety and penitence. But such fasts were not placed in the </p>
<p>same category as the prescribed national fasts. According to Luke 18:12, the </p>
<p>Pharisees fasted twice in a week, and from other evidence we know this to </p>
<p>be on Mondays and ursdays (cf. Did. 81; m. Ta‘an. 14:5; b. Ta‘an. 10a). </p>
<p>ere is also evidence to show that the Pharisees and other Jews might have </p>
<p>connected their fasting with the hastening of the eschaton (b. Sanh. 97b-98a; </p>
<p>Life of Josephus 290; cf. Zech 8:19; 1 Sam 7:6; 1 Macc. 3:47, where fasts are </p>
<p>performed to bring about victory in a holy war). Against this background </p>
<p>we can understand the concern of the Pharisees, and why Jesus defends his </p>
<p>disciples’ lack of fasting with the sort of illustrations he uses. e issue is </p>
<p>not about the prescribed national fasts, but those undertaken personally to </p>
<p>show penitence and hasten the coming of the eschaton.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>On the surface, Jesus seems to be using a common-sense analogy </p>
<p>(i.e., fasting should not take place at weddings [v. 19]). However, there is </p>
<p>a deeper meaning to this analogy. e climax of God’s restoration of the </p>
<p>nation is expressed in Isaiah as a wedding (Isa 62:5). God, the bridegroom, </p>
<p>will marry the land, or Zion, which means restoration for the nation. ere </p>
<p>are also other passages in the Prophets that describe God’s relationship with </p>
<p>Israel, using the marital metaphor (Hos 2; Ezek 16; Jer 2:2; Isa 54:5). ese </p>
<p>passages presuppose a rupture in this relationship, brought about by Israel’s </p>
<p>disobedience. Consequently, the repair of this rupture may be pictured as </p>
<p>(another) wedding. Such a picture is also found at the climax of the book of </p>
<p>Revelation (Rev 19:7–8; 21:1–3, 9–10).</p>
