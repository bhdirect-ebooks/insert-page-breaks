<p>Mark</p>
<p>10:1–31136</p>
<p>the rst: those who wish to receive the kingdom must do so as children. </p>
<p>e phrase “as a little child” in Greek (ōs paidion) may be construed either </p>
<p>as modifying the grammatical subject (whoever) or the grammatical object </p>
<p>(the kingdom of God). Translated the alternatives are: (i) “Whoever, like a </p>
<p>little child, receives the kingdom,” or (ii) “Whoever receives the kingdom </p>
<p>as one receives a little child.” Both are possible and must not be regarded as </p>
<p>mutually exclusive. e solemnity of this truth is reinforced by the prefatory </p>
<p>words “Amen I say to you” (v. 15).</p>
<p>As explained earlier, children then were recognized as being without </p>
<p>status. Being unable to fend for themselves they had to depend on others and </p>
<p>would not be well received, since in ancient society, social reciprocity was </p>
<p>the powerful dynamic that bound people together. So Jesus is saying that, </p>
<p>contrary to what the majority in society is thinking, the kingdom belongs </p>
<p>to such entities. Indeed, without this recognition of one’s utterly dependent </p>
<p>status on God, there is no way for one to receive the kingdom. e disciples </p>
<p>fail because they regard the children as a nuisance to the Messiah, without </p>
<p>remembering that all humans—because of their need for redemption and </p>
<p>forgiveness—are also in some sense a nuisance. But it is to such people that </p>
<p>God comes in his redemptive power. All this means that the least in society </p>
<p>should be given the same welcome to the kingdom.</p>

<p>e words of the young man who approached Jesus are interesting and sig-</p>
<p>nicant.First, nowhere else in Mark’s Gospel is Jesus called a good teacher. </p>
<p>In fact, such an address is attested only once in all the extant Jewish litera-</p>
<p>ture. In a statement that contains a play on the word “good,” Rabbi Eleazar </p>
<p>of Hagronya is addressed thus: “Good greetings to the good teacher from </p>
<p>the good Lord, who from his bounty dispenses good to his people” (b. Ta‘an </p>
<p>24b). What is interesting in this parallel is the connection between the con-</p>
<p>cept of goodness and God’s bounty.We are not sure whether the young man </p>
<p>is attering Jesus, but clearly a similar connection of goodness and wealth </p>
<p>is found in the story. Secondly, his question concerns “eternal life.”is is </p>
<p>probably a shorthand way of referring to the “life of the age to come” (the </p>
<p>Hebrew would be hayyê ‘ôlām habbā,’ or, life in God’s new order), which is, </p>
<p>of course, everlasting.</p>
<p>e young man’s opening words elicit from Jesus the radicalizing of the </p>
<p>concept of goodness.In fact, he connects this to the Shema, the Jewish creed </p>
<p>that confesses one God. e translation “except God alone,” found in some </p>
