<p>Excursus: e Suering Servant of Isaiah 53 and Mark 10:45</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>What evidence is there to support the claim that the Fourth Servant </p>
<p>Song of Isaiah is being appropriated in Mark 10:45? This topic has been </p>
<p>keenly discussed by scholars and we cannot hope to enter fully into this </p>
<p>debate in this short commentary.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>What we will do instead is identify the</p>
<p>arguments for maintaining our case. The critical phrase to discuss is dounai </p>
<p>te¯n psyche¯n autou lytron anti pollo¯n (often translated as “to give his life as </p>
<p>a ransom for many”). </p>
<p>1. First it must be noted that “service” is connected with “the giv-</p>
<p>ing up of the life” in both Mark 10:45 and Isa 53:11. The term used in </p>
<p>Mark 10:45 is diakoneo¯, while the related term in the LXX of Isa 53.11 is </p>
<p>douleuo¯. But behind the LXX stands the Hebrew ‘a¯bad. It must be insisted </p>
<p>that diakoneo¯ is a legitimate translation of the Hebrew ‘a¯bad, and it is often </p>
<p>used and understood as a synonym of douleuo¯, the LXX term. Hence, it is </p>
<p>precarious to mount an objection based on the difference in Greek terminol-</p>
<p>ogy, especially when the two terms are legitimate translation of the Hebrew. </p>
<p>Moreover, in Mark 10:44 the term doulos (the noun) is found, and it is used </p>
<p>as a synonym of diakonos in v. 43. Once the synonymous nature of the two </p>
<p>terms is accepted, we may legitimately see a parallel between Mark 10:45 </p>
<p>and Isaiah 53 LXX.</p>
<p>2. To be noted too is that “to give one’s life” in Mark 10:45 approxi-</p>
<p>mates semantically the Hebrew phrase in 53:12, where the life is men-</p>
<p>tioned as being poured out.</p>
<p>3. The term pollo¯n (i.e., “many”) recalls the rabbîm of Isa 53:11–12: </p>
<p>the Servant dies for many who would be the beneﬁciaries of his self-offering.</p>
<p>4. The greatest objection to our case centers on the use of lytron </p>
<p>(which may be translated as “ransom”). In the Hebrew text of Isa 53:10, </p>
<p>the Servant is described as giving his life as an ’ a¯ š a¯ m , which is the term for </p>
<p>a guilt offering. The LXX never translates ’ a¯ š a¯ m with lytron. Hence, if Mark </p>
<p>is thinking of Isa 53:10, he is using a rather peculiar word to translate a key </p>
<p>term in it. But if we think of Mark 10:45 as not meaning to be a translation </p>
<p>of Isa 53:10, but a summary and a creative appropriation of the task of the </p>
<p>Servant in that passage, the force of this objection will be ameliorated.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>untraditional, perhaps even shocking. See the essays in the forthcoming Jesus and the </p>
<p>Scriptures, to be published as a volume of the LNTS and edited by T. Hägerland.</p>
<p>53. A good start may be made with the collection of essays in Bellinger 1998. See </p>
<p>also Evans 2001: 120–22. e classic objections are found in Hooker 1959; and Barrett </p>
<p>1959: 1–18.</p>
