<p>e Feeding of the 4,000 101</p>
<p>ministry of Jesus, we can conclude it is of great importance to the nascent </p>
<p>Christian movement. All this lends strength to our speculation that Isa 35:6 </p>
<p>is lurking in the background. Mark is therefore saying that the fulllment </p>
<p>of this Isaianic passage has come, and that the Gentiles are the unexpected </p>
<p>beneciaries of these blessings.</p>
<p>If the earlier episode (7:24–30) speaks of crumbs beneting dogs, </p>
<p>this story speaks of dogs having more than just crumbs, as Gentiles now </p>
<p>participate in the benets brought about by the second Exodus and the </p>
<p>eschatological restoration of God’s people. So Jesus’ deep sigh (v. 34) may </p>
<p>symbolize the great exertion connected with drawing the Gentiles into the </p>
<p>kingdom. Not surprisingly, the people’s reaction to the healing is to acclaim </p>
<p>with words never spoken before in Mark’s Gospel: Jesus has done all things </p>
<p>well (kalōs panta pepoiēken)—and this must be the inclusion of Gentiles in </p>
<p>the blessings of the kingdom.</p>
<p>e feature found in v. 36 is familiar, as it is found in earlier stories </p>
<p>(e.g., 1:44–45). e Greek tenses used (imperfect) suggest Jesus repeatedly </p>
<p>commanded the people who were privy to the miracle to remain silent about </p>
<p>it, but they repeatedly did not heed his command and therefore spread the </p>
<p>news. While this may point to a pragmatic concern, there may also be a </p>
<p>deeper theological motif at work. Jesus’ miraculous deeds cannot be fully </p>
<p>understood or authentically appreciated apart from the cross.</p>
<p>The Feeding of the 4,000 (8:1–9)</p>
<p>If this feeding miracle is regarded as taking place in Gentile territory, we </p>
<p>have three miracle stories associated with the Gentiles (starting from 7:24). </p>
<p>But can a Gentile provenance be demonstrated?</p>
<p>It has to be noticed rst of all that Mark does not provide a topo-</p>
<p>graphical note. What we have is a general time note: “in those days.” Since </p>
<p>the locality of the previous story was the Decapolis, a case may be made </p>
<p>that this feeding miracle also takes place there, which is a Gentile region. </p>
<p>Secondly, the term used for the baskets is dierent (spyrides instead of ko-</p>
<p>phinoi, v. 8). As we mentioned earlier in 6:43, kophinos is a distinctively </p>
<p>Jewish receptacle, but the same cannot be said for spyrides, which is a more </p>
<p>general term. irdly, some scholars have argued that the description of the </p>
<p>crowd as “having come from a long distance” (apo makrothen) may imply </p>
<p>that these were Gentiles, since they have sometimes been described with </p>
<p>that phrase (Deut 28:49; 1 Kings 8:41; Isa 60:4; Jer 46:27; cf. Eph 2:13 for </p>
