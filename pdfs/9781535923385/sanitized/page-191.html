<p>e Eschatological Discourse ontheMountofOlives 173</p>
<p>Son of Man, who will be shown in all his glory before Israel and the whole </p>
<p>world at his Parousia. It is this linkage that needs some careful analysis.</p>
<p>To elaborate further: the prediction of the destruction of the Temple </p>
<p>follows from Jesus’ symbolic action in the Temple and his subsequent saying </p>
<p>about casting the mountain into the sea (11:22–25). As readers will recall, </p>
<p>this saying is interpreted by us as pointing to a new badge of election and a </p>
<p>new mode of worship, without the need for a physical Temple. e destruc-</p>
<p>tion of the Temple is a clear signal to those who have eyes to see that it is not </p>
<p>the place but the person to whom faithful Israelites and members of God’s </p>
<p>family are to look. What is only a signal at the destruction of the Temple will </p>
<p>be glaringly obvious at the Parousia of the Son of Man. All this means that </p>
<p>the disciples must remain committed to the message of the gospel that Jesus </p>
<p>preaches. To put it in a nutshell, the following slogan may serve: at the end </p>
<p>stands not the Temple but the Son of Man, and if this is so, loyalty is to be </p>
<p>given only to him.</p>
<p>Regarding its themes, the rst thing to note is that this discourse is </p>
<p>not so much about the signs of the end as the discernment and attitudes </p>
<p>Jesus’ disciples must have, in order to face the ordeal awaiting them. In </p>
<p>other words, the discourse is chiey about discipleship: how they are to be </p>
<p>discerning when the Jewish world is awash with speculation about the ar-</p>
<p>rival of the end, and how they are to have fortitude and commitment to the </p>
<p>gospel in spite of persecution. Commitment does not mean simply standing </p>
<p>rm, it means also actively bearing witness (vv. 9–11). e twin concerns of </p>
<p>discernment and commitment run through the entire discourse. e many </p>
<p>repetitions of “watch” and “be on your guard” bear this out.</p>
<p>A second and related theme may be described as the dampener of </p>
<p>overheated eschatological fervor.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>Much of what Jesus says is calculated to</p>
<p>cool such fervor. ere are many warnings about being led astray and be-</p>
<p>ing caught in the maelstrom of revolutionary action, brought about by an </p>
<p>overheated expectation of the coming of the Messiah. e disciples must </p>
<p>remember that when wars and rumors of wars are prevalent, when many </p>
<p>claim to be the Messiah, and when great earthly disturbances abound, the </p>
<p>end is still not yet (v. 7). ey need to know that the end is not ushered in by </p>
<p>such events but by the glorious coming of the Son of Man, the One whom </p>
<p>they are now following.</p>
<p>Although the dampener eect is pronounced, the message is also </p>
<p>about the denouement. e destruction of the Temple is a signal of its being </p>
<p>close. Indeed, if the disciples are alert, they will also realize that in Jesus’ </p>
<p>ministry, the eschaton is already present in seed form. is implies that the </p>
<p>73. Geddert 1989 emphasizes this.</p>
