<p>Introduction to the Passion Narrative 195</p>
<p>is his whole life given for them. e reason for this is answered by the next </p>
<p>interpretative word, spoken over the cup.</p>
<p>Excursus: The Passover Meal</p>
<p>The traditional Passover meal, as this is gathered from the extant evidence </p>
<p>available to us (m. Pes. 10:1–7), follows the structure below:</p>
<p>The Preliminary Course</p>
<p>• Words of dedication spoken by the presider over the ﬁrst cup.</p>
<p>• Preliminary dish consisting, among other things, of green herbs, bitter </p>
<p>herbs and a sauce of fruit purée.</p>
<p>• The meal proper is served but not yet eaten; the second cup is mixed </p>
<p>and put in its place but not yet drunk.</p>
<p>The Passover Liturgy</p>
<p>• Passover haggadah led by the presider.</p>
<p>• First part of the Passover hallel (Pss 113–14).</p>
<p>• Drinking the second cup (haggadah cup).</p>
<p>The Main Meal</p>
<p>• Grace spoken by the presider over the unleavened bread.</p>
<p>• Meal, consisting of Passover lamb, unleavened bread, bitter herbs </p>
<p>(Exod 12:8), with fruit purée and wine.</p>
<p>• Grace over the third cup (cup of blessing).</p>
<p>The Conclusion</p>
<p>• Second part of the Passover hallel (Pss 115—18).</p>
<p>• Praise over the fourth cup (hallel cup).</p>
<p>So one may conjecture that the cup over which the saying is given is </p>
<p>the third cup or the cup of blessing. And the hymn Jesus and his disciples </p>
<p>sing at the conclusion of the meal might plausibly be the Hallel Psalms, </p>
<p>speciﬁcally Psalms 115—18.</p>
<p>e cup saying</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>completes the meaning of the bread saying. It speaks of</p>
<p>Jesus’ blood as the blood of the covenant. To understand the full impor-</p>
<p>140. e phrase recalls Exodus 24:8, which speaks about the establishment of the </p>
<p>Sinaitic covenant through the shedding of blood. Matthew follows Mark here, but Luke </p>
<p>and Paul speak of the new covenant. Scholars have therefore identied two strands </p>
<p>of tradition relating to the cup-saying: a Markan one and a Lukan-Pauline one. In an </p>
