<p>Gethsemane and the Arrest of Jesus 201</p>
<p>the ear of the servant of the high priest (v. 47). e denite article in Greek </p>
<p>(ton doulon tou archiereōs) indicates he is someone signicant enough to </p>
<p>be singled out. So he is possibly the leader of this group of armed men, or </p>
<p>someone who has been specially commissioned by the high priest to ensure </p>
<p>the arrest is performed.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p>In response to such a show of force, Jesus asks some rhetorical ques-</p>
<p>tions (v. 48). eir function is to convey the point that all this is unnecessary, </p>
<p>since he is not a bandit (the meaning of the Greek epi lēstēn). Banditry was </p>
<p>quite a problem in rst-century Palestine; these bandits usually targeted Ro-</p>
<p>man trains and supplies, and oen enjoyed local protection and support.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this sense they may be regarded as revolutionaries acting against Rome. </p>
<p>e point Jesus wishes to make is that bandits do not engage in teaching </p>
<p>or discussions in the Temple (v. 49). Do note, however, that although Jesus </p>
<p>distances himself from being identied as a bandit, he will later be crucied </p>
<p>between two bandits (15:27). It is plausible that the irony is intended. Be </p>
<p>that as it may, Jesus’ words certainly point out what the ocial delegates </p>
<p>should grasp: his kingdom is of a dierent order, and so there will be no </p>
<p>resistance to this unjust arrest.</p>
<p>Now that things have come to such a head, the instinct to ee for safety </p>
<p>takes over the disciples’ resolve. Mark inserts here an intriguing story of </p>
<p>the ight of an unnamed young man, the details of which are somewhat </p>
<p>comical (vv. 51–52). is apparently inconsequential element of the story </p>
<p>of Jesus’ arrest has led many scholars to suspect some symbolism must be </p>
<p>at work.</p>
<p>158</p>
<p>Frankly, it is dicult to see any symbolic quality in this rather</p>
<p>strange incident. Perhaps it is best to regard it as historical reminiscence, es-</p>
<p>pecially memorable to a member of Mark’s intended audience.</p>
<p>159</p>
<p>is need</p>
<p>not mean Mark is writing himself into the story, as many commentators in </p>
<p>the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have thought.</p>

<p>156. Cf. Viviano 1989: 71–80. e act amounted to mutilation which would dis-</p>
<p>qualify the victim from Temple duties. In other words, the act was intended to destroy </p>
<p>the victim’s career.</p>
<p>157. Horsley and Hanson, Bandits 1985: 190–243.</p>
<p>158. Gundry 1993: 862–63: the young man in white pregures the resurrection of </p>
<p>Jesus; Myers 1988: 368–69: symbolizing the restoration of the disciples that is to come; </p>
<p>Evans 2001: 428: suggesting a Joseph typology but only to reject it; Kermode 1979: </p>
55–64: a type of all Christians who desert the faith, since being divested of clothes by
<p>captors is a sign of shame.</p>
<p>159. Hooker 1991: 352.</p>
<p>160. Marcus 2009: 1124. A good summary of the history of interpretation is found </p>
<p>in Collins 2007: 688–93.</p>
