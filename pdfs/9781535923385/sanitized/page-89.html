<p>Jairus’s Daughter and the Woman with Chronic Bleeding 71</p>
<p>highly signicant because Mark is recounting a resurrection miracle for the </p>
<p>rst time. e words also recall those that were spoken at the stilling of the </p>
<p>storm (4:35–41), and the healing of the woman with a menstrual disorder. </p>
<p>But can death, which is something far worse, be overcome? Together Jesus </p>
<p>and Jairus make the journey, the conclusion of which oers either grief or </p>
<p>joy.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the house, the sight of professional mourners</p>
<p>118</p>
<p> wail-</p>
<p>ing for Jairus’s daughter (v. 38) may have served to reinforce his sense of </p>
<p>hopelessness. To moderns the employing of professional mourners may </p>
<p>seem hypocritical, or at least strange. But such an arrangement could actu-</p>
<p>ally help the bereaved to vent their grief without fear of embarrassment.</p>
<p>Jesus’ statement that the girl is asleep has a double meaning (v. 39). e </p>
<p>language of sleep is oen used in the Bible as a euphemism for death (Dan </p>
<p>12:2), and this should be the interpretation here. Mark’s narrative is cer-</p>
<p>tainly about a miracle being performed and not a misunderstanding being </p>
<p>cleared. Behind this euphemism lay a powerful theological idea: death is not </p>
<p>nal, since Jesus has the power to raise dead people. However, the statement </p>
<p>is understood in the literal sense by the characters in the story and hence, </p>
<p>it engenders scorn (vv. 39–40). All this may have raised further doubt for </p>
<p>Jairus. His faith is challenged. Has he done the right thing by trusting Jesus?</p>
<p>e Vindication of Faith: the Raising of Jairus’s Daughter (5:41–43)</p>
<p>In the girl’s room with a small group,</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>Jesus takes her by the hand and</p>
<p>utters the Aramaic words, “Talitha koum!” which Mark translates for his </p>
<p>audience as “Little girl, I say to you, get up.” is is the rst time that Mark </p>
<p>inserts Aramaic words into his narrative. ere are three other instances </p>
<p>where Aramaic words are retained: ephphatha in 7:34, abba in 14:36, and of </p>
<p>course the eloi eloi lama sabachthani of 15:34. What may be the signicance </p>
<p>of recording this Aramaic utterance here? Scholars are puzzled, as no theo-</p>
<p>logical theme may be found.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>Probably this is a detail that has remained</p>
<p>118. We may call them thus for the following reasons. First of all, Jesus throws them </p>
<p>out (v. 40). It is hard to envisage Jesus’ doing this if they were members of the fam-</p>
<p>ily. Secondly, the really bereaved would not have derided a statement oering hope (v. </p>
<p>40). e same would not be true for professional mourners. irdly, it was common </p>
<p>practice for those who could aord it to hire professional mourners. See Culpepper </p>
<p>2007: 177–78.</p>
<p>119. Mark does not explain why only three among Jesus’ twelve apostles are al-</p>
<p>lowed into the room. Presumably these have a special relationship with Jesus (the inner </p>
<p>circle), and constitute his most important witnesses.</p>
<p>120. Marcus thinks the use of a foreign language is part of the repertoire of ancient </p>
<p>faith healing techniques, and also that its presence heightens mystery (Marcus 2000: </p>
