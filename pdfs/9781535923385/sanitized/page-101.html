<p>Miracles Around the Lake 83</p>
<p>because it will take 200 denarii (i.e., eight months’ wages), to do so (vv. </p>
<p>37–38). is rather unreasonable challenge should not be understood as </p>
<p>being spoken tongue-in-cheek, or as a foil to revealing how stupendous the </p>
<p>miracle will be. Instead, it should be regarded as indicating what is to be </p>
<p>part and parcel of the disciples’ work. As envoys of Jesus, they are to minis-</p>
<p>ter to those in need. But how can their paltry resources be enough to feed </p>
<p>so many? What happens next is familiar to many Bible readers—ve loaves </p>
<p>and two sh are used to feed 5,000—but there are layers of deeper meaning </p>
<p>found in the details, which will be explicated below.</p>
<p>e Greek text of v. 39 presents interesting possibilities. e word used </p>
<p>for the people’s posture is anaklinō. To a Gentile audience this is certainly </p>
<p>the posture for a banquet.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> For a Jewish audience, it has the added possibil-</p>
<p>ity of recalling the posture for the Passover.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Greek word</p>
<p>used for the groupings is symposia, a word occurring only once in the whole </p>
<p>of the NT. e word means literally “drinking together,” and it was used </p>
<p>originally to designate a drinking party. By extension, it later carried the </p>
<p>meaning of a banquet. A counter-banquet to that which was held by Herod </p>
<p>Antipas in 6:21 is being presented.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>e datum that the grass is green is also signicant, and it is found </p>
<p>only in Mark’s account of this feeding story. In Galilee grass grows in the </p>
<p>wilderness only during springtime, as this is the time of rainfall.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>Spring is</p>
<p>also the season in which the Passover is celebrated.</p>
<p>143</p>
<p> Mark may be present-</p>
<p>ing Jesus as the shepherd who leads his ock to green pastures, recalling the </p>
<p>Shepherd Psalm (Ps 23).</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>e word used to describe the groupings in v. 40 is prasiai. is is yet </p>
<p>again a word which occurs only once in the entire NT, and its usage here is </p>
<p>puzzling. In secular Greek it actually means owerbeds, and is never used </p>
<p>to describe a grouping of people.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>Perhaps Mark uses it for vividness: the</p>
<p>people are grouped together in an orderly way like owerbeds. Some schol-</p>
ars have also argued that the division into ies and hundreds recalls the action of Moses in Exod 18:21, where he divides Israel into such groupings
