<p>Further Controversies 163</p>
<p>at the climax of this tale: the leaders continue in the same evil spirit of their </p>
<p>forbears; not only have they killed the servants sent, they have the temerity </p>
<p>to kill the heir also. So judgment must fall. e owner of the vineyard will </p>
<p>take action, personally seeing to it that these tenants are punished and the </p>
<p>vineyard given to other tenants. So the judgment theme is followed by the </p>
<p>replacement theme. e question then is, “Who are these replacement ten-</p>
<p>ants?” Unfortunately, Mark does not make this clear. We could try guessing </p>
<p>or regard the question of their identity to be a secondary concern. However, </p>
<p>in view of how history panned out, Mark’s audience would undoubtedly </p>
<p>think of either the apostles or the church, comprising Jews and Gentiles, as </p>
<p>the new tenants.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>e second theme is Jesus’ identity, expressed through Ps 118:22–</p>
<p>23.Once we take into account the Psalm’s context (see excursus) and how it </p>
<p>is interpreted, we can see Jesus’ point. Just like the central character of the </p>
<p>Psalm, he will be playing the role of a leader. Not only this, but he will also </p>
<p>be the rejected stone. However, this rejected stone, in God’s providence, will </p>
<p>become the capping stone. is is the stone that either completes an arch or </p>
<p>sits at the pinnacle of a building.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>When this happens, those with eyes to</p>
<p>see will understand how marvelous it is, and that God is behind it. So Jesus </p>
<p>is pointing to the two stages in the unfolding of his identity: rejection and </p>
<p>then vindication. If the stone image is to be construed as a synecdoche for </p>
<p>the Temple, Jesus is pictured as the one who completes the eschatological </p>
<p>Temple (cf. John 2:19). Hence, the Temple motif is still being maintained, if </p>
<p>only in the background.</p>
<p>Excursus: The Appropriation of Psalm 118:22–23</p>
<p>The text used by Mark agrees with the LXX, which is also a close translation </p>
<p>of the Masoretic Text. This passage contains the theme of reversal: the </p>
<p>one rejected will be vindicated and gloriﬁed. In its original context, the </p>
<p>entire Psalm is a thanksgiving liturgy, with the central character recount-</p>
<p>ing his experience of troubles and subsequent deliverance by God, even </p>
<p>though plural voices creep in at certain junctures (e.g., vv. 25–26). Verses </p>
<p>22–23, however, form part of the liturgy connected with the joyful entrance </p>
<p>of the central character, whose role is annually re-enacted by a leader of </p>
<p>the pilgrims. The Targums (Tg. Ps 118:19–27) understand this character </p>
