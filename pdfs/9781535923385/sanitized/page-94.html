<p>Excursus: Discrepancies Over What is Allowed</p>
<p>The items (staff and sandals) that are allowed the Twelve in Mark’s account </p>
<p>are expressly denied them in the parallel account in Matthew (10:10). The </p>
<p>parallel in Luke mentions only the forbidding of a staff, and is silent over </p>
<p>whether sandals are allowed (Luke 9:3; but sandals are forbidden in Luke </p>
<p>10:4). There appears to be no fully satisfactory solution to this discrepancy. </p>
<p>The popular ones appeal to contextual or grammatical explanations. One </p>
<p>theory posits that Mark has altered the originally stringent forms of Jesus, </p>
<p>which are attested in Matthew and Luke, to suit the changed circumstances </p>
<p>of his time.</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>(Even if this were the case, it would not help those seeking</p>
<p>harmonization). Another argues that what Matthew and Luke actually mean </p>
<p>is that the disciples are not allowed to carry a second staff, or a second </p>
<p>pair of sandals.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>(If so, why don’t Matthew and Luke make this clear?) As</p>
<p>important as harmonizing the parallel accounts may be, our concern here is </p>
<p>with Mark’s message.</p>
<p>e Reaction of Herod Antipas (6:14–16)</p>
<p>ese verses speak of Jesus’ increasing popularity, leading to speculations </p>
<p>about his identity. Herod Antipas’s reaction is highlighted and this prepares </p>
<p>the way for the narration to follow. Although he is given the title of “king” </p>
<p>here, Augustus Caesar actually refused to grant him the said title, but had </p>
<p>him conferred instead as tetrarch (derived from a Greek word which means </p>
<p>“ruler of a quarter;” cf. Matt 14:1).</p>
<p>131</p>
<p>Such a technical nicety, important to</p>
<p>politicians, is of no great interest to Mark or many members of his audience. </p>
<p>In his territory, Antipas calls the shots.</p>
<p>What is reported amounts to nothing less than John the Baptist’s be-</p>
<p>ing raised from the dead in Antipas’s opinion (v. 16). ere is more than </p>
<p>meets the eye in this simple datum. First of all, Jesus’ growing fame is due, </p>
<p>in part, to the work of the Twelve. In other words, the success of the Twelve </p>
<p>is implied, even though it is not narrated.</p>
