<p>A Sketch of Mark’s eology</p>
<p>232</p>
<p>authentic Son of God, a claim made by Roman Emperors. e subversion </p>
<p>theme is also found in the story of the Gerasene demoniac (5:1–20). is </p>
<p>is written to allude to the Roman annexation of lands through its military </p>
<p>might. Like the legion of demons that has possessed the man, Roman le-</p>
<p>gions have taken over lands and oppressed people. Jesus’ exorcism of the </p>
<p>demoniac is told in such a way as to hint at Jesus’ power to cast out Roman </p>
<p>subjection. is is done not by violent means, however, but by the exorcistic </p>
<p>word. If there is any destruction in the encounter between Jesus and the </p>
<p>demoniac, it is not one that is performed by Jesus. e possessed pigs run </p>
<p>into the lake and drown themselves, probably suggesting Rome will destroy </p>
<p>itself. So there is a clash of kingdoms, but this is not done in a bellicose way, </p>
<p>as was the case with the Jewish Zealots. Instead, it is done through non-</p>
<p>violent means. Being non-violent does not mean being impotent, for Jesus’ </p>
<p>word has the power to drive out legions.</p>
<p>All this speaks powerfully to the reality confronting Mark’s rst read-</p>
<p>ers, a situation in which Rome has started to rear its demonic head. ese </p>
<p>readers would not be encountering many who are demon-possessed, but </p>
<p>they would certainly come across many who are Empire-possessed. e </p>
<p>continuing work of the Church in relation to the Empire must be that of </p>
<p>removing Rome from peoples’ hearts, whether this refers to its nefarious </p>
<p>inuence or its dehumanizing presence. is could only be done through </p>
<p>the preaching of the gospel. e binding of this strong man will be a con-</p>
<p>tinuous task for the Church, even as she waits for the consummation of the </p>
<p>kingdom.</p>
<p>Discipleship (the Way of the Lord)</p>
<p>e theme of discipleship in Mark has been much discussed in scholarly </p>
<p>circles.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>is is not surprising, as Jesus is seldom alone in Mark’s tale. He</p>
<p>exercises his ministry in public, appeals to the crowd to follow him, and has </p>
<p>a band of followers. e theme of discipleship is developed through the use </p>
<p>of a few motifs.</p>
<p>e rst motif concerns the authoritative call of Jesus.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>People do not</p>
<p>choose to follow Jesus, but it is he who calls, and they obey (1:17–18, 20; </p>
<p>2:14). e call is to be with him, follow him, learn from him, and model </p>
<p>their lives aer him. So special is this call that Mark does not shy away from </p>
<p>using the word “creation” (3:14, 16). e disciples may therefore be regarded </p>
as the reconstituted people of God, made possible only by divine action.
