<p>Challenge in Jerusalem: SymbolsofFulllmentandJudgment 157</p>
<p>So we see how these data point in the direction of Jesus’ staging a pro-</p>
<p>phetic protest against the corrupt practices of a Temple that should be ready </p>
<p>to welcome the long-expected king and fulll its role as a house of prayer for </p>
<p>all nations. What about the strange statement of v. 16: that Jesus does not al-</p>
<p>low anyone to carry a vessel across the Temple courts? is datum is unique </p>
<p>to Mark. Since he does not explain why Jesus forbids anyone from carrying </p>
<p>a vessel through the Temple, we are le guessing at Jesus’ reason. e main </p>
<p>scholarly proposals are the following: (i) Jesus was preventing people from </p>
<p>taking a shortcut through the Temple (based on the evidence of m. Ber. </p>
<p>9:5);</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>(ii) Jesus was acting in fulllment of Zechariah 14:20–21, where it</p>
<p>is prophesied that every vessel in the Temple is holy; Jesus would then be </p>
<p>forbidding people from carrying unclean vessels;</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>(iii) Jesus did not allow</p>
<p>merchandise to be carried across the Temple courts, to prevent the corrupt </p>
<p>sales from continuing.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> Our interpretation favors (iii), which the NIV sup-</p>
<p>ports, but it must be admitted that the evidence as it stands does not permit </p>
<p>rm conclusions.</p>
<p>In response to Jesus’ action, the Temple establishment (the chief priests </p>
<p>and the scribes) seek to have him killed because his action amounts to a </p>
<p>shrill challenge to them. In their eyes, he has struck at the most important </p>
<p>national and theological symbol. But no action is taken, only conniving. </p>
<p>is is because the populace seem to be in favor of such an action (v. 18). </p>
<p>e fact that he is not lynched to death by the people speaks volumes of the </p>
<p>negative attitude the crowds may have towards the Temple establishment. It </p>
<p>should also be pointed out that the crowd’s allegiance can easily be swayed </p>
<p>from one of astonishment to one of antagonism, if the Temple establish-</p>
<p>ment plays its cards right by shiing the focus away from the elements of </p>
<p>Jesus’ action to the locus of the action (i.e., it was performed in and against </p>
<p>the Temple, not the establishment). is explains why a few days later they </p>
<p>shout, “Crucify him!”</p>
<p>To sum up our interpretation: there are two main considerations which </p>
<p>inform Jesus’ action in the Temple. e rst is the perceived corruption of </p>
<p>the Temple establishment, which is using its position for lucrative gain. Je-</p>
<p>sus’ action may be regarded as a prophetic demonstration, performed in </p>
<p>protest against this corruption. However, his statements which explain his </p>
<p>actions, citing from Isaiah and Jeremiah, imply this is no ordinary prophet </p>
<p>and no ordinary action. is leads us to the second reason. Jesus perceives </p>
<p>that the hour of the fulllment of the Zion promises has come. e Temple </p>
