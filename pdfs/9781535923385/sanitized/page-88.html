<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>5:21–4370</p>
<p>e healing is immediate, in contrast to all the futile remedies she has </p>
<p>tried (v. 29). It is also palpable, because she can feel it in her body. What is </p>
<p>however much more signicant is the eect on Jesus. He senses that power </p>
<p>has gone out of him, and asks who has touched his clothes (v. 30). Since the </p>
<p>crowd is pressing upon him, this appears to be a rather silly question, and </p>
<p>Jesus’ disciples think exactly that (v. 31). However, the point of the Markan </p>
<p>story is that it is only one particular touch that draws forth power from Je-</p>
<p>sus: the touch of the impure. e usual Jewish notion is that the impure cor-</p>
<p>rupts the pure whenever the two come into contact. is is why measures </p>
<p>must be taken to protect the pure from ritual contamination. is story </p>
<p>expresses the reverse: the pure cleanses the impure when the two meet. A </p>
<p>further implication is that the boundaries that are enacted for the protection </p>
<p>of purity are no longer needed. We have here a stful of revolutionary ideas!</p>
<p>e fear of the woman is understandable (v. 33). She has done what is </p>
<p>socially unacceptable. An impure person must not mingle with the crowd, </p>
<p>as this will spread ritual impurity. She has contravened social and ritual </p>
<p>codes in her desire to be healed.</p>
<p>However, faith must not be kept hidden. Hence, Jesus’ insistent search </p>
<p>for the person who has touched him (v. 32) is also designed to draw the </p>
<p>woman out from the camouaging crowd. Mark ends the story with the im-</p>
<p>portant words: “Your faith has healed (or ‘saved’) you” (v. 34). ese words </p>
<p>are also relevant for Jairus, as they can instruct him on the power of faith. </p>
<p>is being the case, this sandwiched story is more than just an interlude. It </p>
<p>contributes to the thickening plot of the story of Jairus.</p>
<p>e Test of Faith: the News of Death (5:35–40)</p>
<p>e interrupted story is resumed, with dire news coming from Jairus’s </p>
<p>household. His daughter has died, and hence, there is no need for the visit </p>
<p>to be made (v. 35). All human experience teaches that the onset of death </p>
<p>should be the cessation of all eort.</p>
<p>Signicantly, Jesus ignores such logic. Instead, he exhorts Jairus to be-</p>
<p>lieve in the face of nality and the impossible (v. 36). ese words express </p>
<p>the main theme of the story. In the shadow of death, and going against the </p>
<p>grain of typical human responses, Jesus challenges Jairus to believe. is is </p>
