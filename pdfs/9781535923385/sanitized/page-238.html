<p>Fusing the Horizons: Mark’s Achievement220</p>
the terrible injustice lies divine vindication, and beyond the suffering stands
<p>glory. What is most crucial for the understanding of the Christian religion, </p>
<p>however, is that this was taken up by none other than he who would be the </p>
<p>vicegerent of God, the Son of Man himself! Hence righteous sufferers will </p>
<p>never feel lonely anymore.</p>
<p>There is still one more point to note that is highly relevant to the </p>
<p>times we live in and it concerns the foundational narratives of religions and </p>
<p>some current tendencies. The foundational narrative of a religion inevitably </p>
<p>shapes its outlook and praxis. If this narrative is about how a leader led his </p>
<p>followers to ﬁght for freedom and won against all odds, this will become a </p>
<p>key theme in this religion, and later followers will have no qualms unsheath-</p>
<p>ing swords against anything that appears to threaten it. If their hero did </p>
<p>it, why shouldn’t they? Indeed, if their hero won against all odds, small </p>
<p>numbers or poor equipment will be of no hindrance to them. However, if this </p>
<p>narrative is about the acceptance of an excruciating death because of love </p>
<p>for humanity and obedience to God’s will, a powerful check is put on the hu-</p>
<p>man tendency to take up the sword to propagate religion. Of course, it does </p>
<p>not always work out that way, but followers of this religion will know that if </p>
<p>they resort to violence, they are liable to be criticized by other followers and </p>
<p>stand condemned before the Almighty. He who lives by the sword will die </p>
<p>by the sword, and cause misery for many because the effects of violence do </p>
<p>last a long time.</p>
<p>Jesus’ death on the cross will therefore have powerful ethical implica-</p>
<p>tions for Christians. The vicegerent of God believed his vocation was to drink </p>
<p>the cup assigned by the Father. This involved his sacriﬁcial death for the </p>
<p>sins of the world. In other words, violence was not met with violence, but </p>
<p>in an inscrutable way absorbed and conquered. And rightly the one symbol </p>
<p>that identiﬁes Christianity before the world is the cross, a symbol of torture, </p>
<p>cruelty and death. Yet, the one who died on it was not weak but strong and </p>
<p>courageous, because he accepted it as God’s will and as the necessary </p>
<p>means for the reconciliation of the world. Indeed, he who died on it did not </p>
<p>stay dead but was raised again to life. The cross then speaks of courageous </p>
<p>and obedient love, and the indomitable spirit that entrusts things to God </p>
<p>and believes that beyond death lies the resurrection. Death does not have </p>
<p>the last word but life, which is offered to all.</p>
