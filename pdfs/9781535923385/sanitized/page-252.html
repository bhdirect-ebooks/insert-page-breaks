<p>A Sketch of Mark’s eology</p>
<p>234</p>
<p>comes to portraying the disciples’ failure. e disciples are portrayed as </p>
<p>lacking faith and understanding (4:13, 40; 6:37, 52; 7:18; 8:4, 14–21, 32–33; </p>
<p>9:5–6, 10, 14–29, 32–41; 10:10, 24–26, 32, 35–41). When the crunch comes, </p>
<p>they abandon Jesus. However, the failure of the disciples is only part of the </p>
<p>story. e nale of the Gospel speaks of restoration: the risen Christ will </p>
<p>once again shepherd them, including Peter, the one who denied him (16:7). </p>
<p>So the failure of the disciples must be related to the theme of restoration. A </p>
<p>pastoral message is therefore sounded out, which will be relevant and en-</p>
<p>couraging to all listeners of Mark’s tale.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>Such people will be able to identify</p>
<p>with the disciples’ frailty and nd solace in the restorative Shepherd.</p>
