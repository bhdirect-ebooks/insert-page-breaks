<p>6:31–5682</p>
<p>and two sh (6:31–44). e second describes Jesus walking on water in the </p>
<p>midst of a storm. is results in great fear among his disciples, which Jesus </p>
<p>also allays (6:45–52). ese two miracles may be known as nature miracles. </p>
<p>ey prompt the question about Jesus’ identity. In this regard they may be </p>
<p>seen as a further development of the theme rst introduced in 4:35–41, </p>
<p>which is held in abeyance until now. e collection of miracle stories is con-</p>
<p>cluded by a brief description of Jesus’ healing ministry in Gennesaret and </p>
<p>other towns (6:53–56).</p>
<p>e Feeding of the 5,000 (6:31–44)</p>
<p>e abortive attempt at ensuring the disciples have a time of quiet and rest </p>
<p>sets the stage for this miracle story (vv. 31–33). So great is the enthusiasm </p>
<p>for Jesus that the crowd succeed in reaching Jesus’ intended destination on </p>
<p>foot, before he and his party arrive by boat. How they managed to outrun </p>
<p>the boat—and taking a much longer distance at that—we will never know. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, many commentators think Mark is exaggerating here.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Be that as it may, Mark certainly intends to depict the great enthusiasm of </p>
<p>the crowds.</p>
<p>e sight of a great crowd eagerly awaiting him leads Jesus to have </p>
<p>compassion on them (v. 34), as they appeared to him as sheep without a </p>
<p>shepherd. is simple description is latent with great meaning. First, the </p>
<p>verb splanchnizomai (which means “having compassion”) is not common in </p>
<p>Mark (here and in 8:2, and possibly 1:41). Whenever it is found, it is used </p>
<p>of Jesus. He is thus presented as the compassionate one. Instead of regard-</p>
<p>ing the crowd as a nuisance, he cares for them. is datum must be kept </p>
<p>in mind as we attempt to decipher the meaning of the miracle. Secondly, </p>
<p>the image of sheep without shepherd provides the hermeneutical key for </p>
<p>what is to follow. It is also a common biblical description of Israel when </p>
<p>she is bere of capable and godly leadership (Num 27:17; 1 Kings 22:17; </p>
<p>Isa 13:14; Ezek 34:5; Zech 10:2). Indeed, the restoration of Israel may be </p>
<p>described as the raising up of the one shepherd, who is God’s vicegerent, to </p>
<p>lead his ock (Ezek 34:23; 37:24; Mic 5:4). e miracle of the feeding of the </p>
<p>5,000 answers such a hope. Many details of the story also convey that this </p>
<p>miracle is profoundly signicant, which will be examined in the course of </p>
<p>the commentary.</p>
<p>Ever watchful of time, the disciples suggest to Jesus that the crowd </p>
<p>should be dismissed in order that they may get food for themselves (vv. 35–</p>
<p>36). e reply of Jesus that they should be feeding the crowd is astonishing, </p>
