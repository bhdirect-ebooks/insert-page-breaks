<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>13:1–37174</p>
<p>person they will see at the denouement is not an unfamiliar gure, but one </p>
<p>who has always been with them: incognito now but revealed in great glory </p>
<p>at the end. at said, the destruction of the Temple remains a signicant </p>
<p>pointer to the denouement, because in this event God has demonstrated </p>
<p>powerfully to speak of the end.</p>
<p>e above dovetails neatly with the nal theme, which may be re-</p>
<p>garded as the most important theme of the discourse. Although it is oen </p>
<p>submerged, it emerges with clarity at vv. 24–27. is is about the vindication </p>
<p>of Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>He may be the despised and rejected of the nation,</p>
<p>sacriced in the name of maintaining the status quo, and cast away as ex-</p>
<p>pedient fodder to a voracious Empire. But he will be vindicated: both in the </p>
<p>near future—with the destruction of the Temple—and at the end of the age. </p>
<p>But before that day comes, the disciples have a message to bear to the na-</p>
<p>tions, a message which he has preached and which is profoundly about him.</p>
<p>e themes elaborated above are relevant to the Twelve and also the </p>
<p>Markan audience, who would be facing the prospect of persecutions. Hence, </p>
<p>the eschatological discourse provides not esoteric knowledge about the end, </p>
<p>but practical teaching for the long and arduous—but incomparably mean-</p>
<p>ingful—road of discipleship. e disciples will need discernment and a cool </p>
<p>head when ery tempers control the agenda of society, and eschatological </p>
<p>forecasting serves as news of the day. ey will need strength for standing </p>
<p>rm and remaining faithful to the end. What will help them do all this is the </p>
<p>belief that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of Man who will come again as the </p>
<p>vindicated and the exalted, to consummate God’s plan.</p>
<p>With the above themes serving as reference points, we are ready to </p>
<p>enter the world of the discourse. But there is one more thing to take with </p>
<p>us: the structure of the discourse. It may be argued that the progression </p>
<p>of thought in the discourse has been carefully designed, in that an ABA’B’ </p>
<p>structure and two time-horizons, conceptually related, are being used.</p>
