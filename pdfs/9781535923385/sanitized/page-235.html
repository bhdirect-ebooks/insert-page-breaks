<p>Jesus’ Crucixion and Death 217</p>
<p>confess he is the Son of God.</p>
<p>208</p>
<p> e “secrecy theme” that has been develop-</p>
<p>ing over many chapters is now at its terminal point. Without the crucixion, </p>
<p>the meaning of true messiahship is liable to be misunderstood.</p>
<p>e second point concerns ethnicity. is profound confession is </p>
<p>made by a Gentile centurion of all people! Might Mark be saying three fur-</p>
<p>ther things in this connection? One, Gentiles may recognize in the crucied </p>
<p>Jesus the Messiah of God. Two, the possibility is open even for those work-</p>
<p>ing for the Empire to come to faith. ere is no disbarment for them even </p>
<p>when the Empire appears to be attacking Christianity. ree, the Empire’s </p>
<p>concept of the son of god is subverted.</p>
<p>209</p>
<p> e usual notion is that of a char-</p>
<p>ismatic and victorious Emperor, worthy of the reverence and worship of his </p>
<p>subjects. His glory is best seen in a Roman triumph. is means that what </p>
<p>Mark presents here is surely one of the most profound paradoxes known </p>
<p>to Roman citizens and subjects. He who was crucied on a Roman gibbet </p>
<p>is confessed as authentically (the Greek used is alēthōs) the Son of God! A </p>
<p>Roman soldier who is so used to aligning the title “Son of God” with Caesar </p>
<p>and all his pomp realizes there is an alternative—displayed in the crucix-</p>
<p>ion and death of Jesus.</p>
<p>e Female Witnesses (15:40–41)</p>
<p>Interestingly, Mark singles out a group of people that writers of the ancient </p>
<p>world would usually ignore. ese are the women followers of Jesus. Mark’s </p>
<p>explicit comment in v. 41 implies that there is a deeper layer of meaning </p>
<p>here: they were Jesus followers’ when he was active in Galilee. Perhaps the </p>
<p>quiet ways of these women in their following of Jesus stand up to the test </p>
<p>better than the bravado of Jesus’ male disciples, since these male followers </p>
<p>are conspicuously absent.</p>
<p>In this group of women followers, three are singled out for special </p>
<p>mention: Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of </p>
<p>Joses, and Salome. ese women will play a key role in the resurrection </p>
<p>narrative, as the rst witnesses of Jesus’ resurrection.</p>
<p>208. Even if the comment was meant to be ironic or sarcastic (Burchard 1983: </p>
<p>1–11), in Mark’s hand it serves the purpose of furthering the theme of saturoformic </p>
<p>revelation (so Marcus 2009: 1059).</p>
