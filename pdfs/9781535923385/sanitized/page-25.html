<p>Introduction 7</p>
<p>either in the form of repudiation or persecution. From this observation, it is </p>
<p>oen thought that Mark was written to an audience experiencing persecu-</p>
<p>tion from society or state. us Mark’s Gospel would have the purpose of </p>
<p>rearming the importance of the gospel to a beleaguered community, and </p>
<p>helping them fall in line with the way of the Lord, especially during times of </p>
<p>persecution. e way of the cross is the way of Jesus, and this is the way that </p>
<p>would lead ultimately to glory. History tells us Nero began an intense perse-</p>
<p>cution of Christians in Rome in AD 64. is might have been the impetus </p>
<p>for Mark’s Gospel to be written.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>e other possibility is that Mark intended to set in writing the oral </p>
<p>apostolic tradition, especially Peter’s, as the band of apostles was passing </p>
<p>away. is serves the purpose of preserving the tradition for future gen-</p>
<p>erations. e evidence from Papias lends support to such a theory, for he </p>
<p>implies that Mark wrote before Peter’s death.</p>
<p>ere is no need to choose between the two, as Mark could con-</p>
<p>ceivably have had a few purposes in mind (including those not discussed </p>
<p>earlier). Here it may be instructive to note the subtle dierence, and yet </p>
<p>inter-dependability, between occasion and purpose. e occasion which led </p>
<p>to the writing may arguably have been the onset of persecution or the aging </p>
<p>of the apostles. is might have triggered an intention to write a document </p>
<p>to achieve not just one but a set of objectives.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Such objectives may have</p>
<p>been pastoral in nature, didactic or polemical (i.e., Mark might be counter-</p>
<p>ing some false teaching),</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>or all of the above. So we need not come down</p>
<p>rmly on a particular purpose.</p>
<p>Literary Characteristics</p>
<p>What sort of writing is the Gospel of Mark? Comparing it with the whole </p>
<p>range of ancient literature, what comes closest to it is known as the bios or </p>
<p>“L i fe .”</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>is is an ancient form of biography, oen written to encourage the</p>
<p>audience to follow the example of the featured life. To be sure, Mark’s writing </p>
<p>would appear rather dierent from such bioi in that the focus is on the pas-</p>
<p>sion and death of his “hero.” But what makes it dierent is the character not </p>
<p>the genre. Mark wants his audience to know that his central character, Jesus </p>
<p>of Nazareth, is unlike any other in the ancient world, indeed in the whole of </p>
