<p>More Revolutionary Values for Disciples 131</p>
<p>sayings is about what true greatness means, and how this involves service </p>
<p>and a largeness of heart. Without these qualities it will be impossible for the </p>
<p>disciples to have peace with each other or with those who show the slender-</p>
<p>est connection with the Jesus movement.</p>
<p>Hence, a case may be made for construing the sayings on salt as being </p>
<p>about discipleship.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> If we invoke OT imagery, salt and re are words con-</p>
<p>nected with sacrices oered to God (Exod 30:35; Lev 2:13; Ezra 6:9; 7:22; </p>
<p>Ezek 43:24). If this is the primary horizon of meaning, the phrase “everyone </p>
<p>will be salted with re” has a limited reference to Jesus’ disciples, and the </p>
<p>total thrust of the saying is that every disciple must be dedicated like an </p>
<p>oering to God. e verse that follows speaks of purication (i.e., if we now </p>
<p>think of salt as a purifying agent).</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>is is eminently possible, since re is</p>
<p>also a purifying agent. Such purication is necessary before one may be of-</p>
<p>fered to God. But purication implies testing. One test that may come to the </p>
<p>disciples is the presence of those who appear to be connected to the Jesus </p>
<p>movement by the slenderest of threads. Dedication to God therefore means </p>
<p>the disciples have to learn to have the largeness of heart so as to be at peace </p>
<p>with others, including those who appear to be “outsiders.” is is, then, one </p>
<p>possible way of linking these rather disparate sayings with the themes of the </p>
<p>preceding passages.</p>
<p>More Revolutionary Values for Disciples (10:1–31)</p>
<p>Mark 10:1–31 contains three stories that have as their central concern the </p>
<p>revolutionary values of the kingdom of God. In this respect, these stories </p>
<p>continue the basic thrust of the earlier ones (9:30–50): following Jesus in-</p>
<p>volves re-envisioning societal mores and one’s values. e values concern </p>
<p>marriage, children, and possessions, three key preoccupations of human </p>
<p>beings. Even today, statistics relating to the break-up of marriages, pictures </p>
<p>of destitute and neglected children scavenging for food, and intrigues and </p>
<p>betrayals brought about by a desire to gain a larger slice of the economic pie </p>
<p>are news that still haunts.</p>
<p>Divorce and God’s Original Intention for Marriage (10:1–12)</p>
<p>e itinerary given in v. 1 is peculiar, leading to interesting alternatives in </p>
<p>the manuscript tradition. Supposing that the NIV has followed the original </p>
<p>reading, what we have described is a journey from Capernaum (9:33) into </p>
