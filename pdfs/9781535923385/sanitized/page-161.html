<p>Following the Messiah in Service: ird Passion Prediction 143</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the reply of Jesus mentions that they do not know </p>
<p>what they are asking for. e metaphors of cup and baptism are connected </p>
<p>with Jesus’ vocation. In the OT, the cup stands for the destiny to which one </p>
<p>is appointed. In this sense it can convey the notion of blessing (Ps 11:6; </p>
<p>16:5; 116:13), judgment (Ps 75:8; Jer 25:15–29; Ezek 23:31–34; Hab 2:16), or </p>
<p>simply suering, without any judgment being implied (Isa 51:17–23; Lam </p>
<p>4:21). Since the next usage in Mark speaks of the suering that has been </p>
<p>destined for Jesus (14:36), the “cup” should mean suering. Baptism is not </p>
<p>a metaphor that is well developed in the OT, and so we will have to look </p>
<p>at ideas contemporaneous with Jesus’ time. Since baptisms are oen water </p>
<p>rites that involve the overwhelming of a person with a uid, one may think </p>
<p>of this as the dominant idea (cf. Luke 12:50). Combining this with the no-</p>
<p>tions suggested by the metaphor of cup, the conclusion is that Jesus is speak-</p>
<p>ing of being overwhelmed by suering or judgment. at said, there may be </p>
<p>a deeper level of meaning. e word “baptism” in Mark’s Gospel may recall </p>
<p>either the activity of John the Baptist, or more probably the baptism of Jesus </p>
<p>through which his vocation was given. is then dovetails neatly with Jesus’ </p>
<p>challenge: what he will be going through belongs exclusively to his vocation.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, the two disciples answer that they are able. Jesus </p>
<p>agrees. As disciples of Jesus, their vocation involves that too. But what is </p>
<p>implicit is that the disciples think of suering and judgment as only a phase </p>
<p>or transition to glory. ey have not grasped a more powerful connec-</p>
<p>tion between glory and suering, especially when it is seen in the light of </p>
<p>the Messiah’s vocation. Jesus’ next statement in v. 40 is, therefore, barbed. </p>
<p>First of all, such positions are only for those for whom they are prepared. </p>
<p>is theoretically may rule out these two disciples. But more signicantly, </p>
<p>Mark tells us in 15:27 with identical phraseology that the persons by Jesus’ </p>
<p>right and le are the two crucied malefactors! Mark may be suggesting </p>
<p>the following: if ever there was an enthronement for the Messiah in Mark’s </p>
<p>Gospel, it would be the cross; if ever there were companions sharing Jesus’ </p>
<p>enthronement glory, it was the two crucied malefactors.</p>
<p>If our interpretation is on target, the conversation between Jesus and </p>
<p>his two disciples is seen to be full of ironies. Mark already indicates this </p>
<p>when he narrates Jesus as saying that James and John do not know what they </p>
<p>are asking for. e suering of the Messiah is something that is uniquely the </p>
<p>vocation of Jesus. Suering is not a means to glory, but is itself the display of </p>
<p>the messianic glory. Although James and John claim they are able to drink </p>
<p>Jesus’ cup and be baptized with his baptism, when the crunch comes they </p>
<p>fail.</p>
