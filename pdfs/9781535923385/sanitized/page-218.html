<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>14:32–52200</p>
<p>injunction to watch and pray stems from the antithesis of spirit and esh </p>
<p>(v. 38). is antithesis is also mentioned in the OT (Isa 31:3) and the Pau-</p>
<p>line writings (Rom 7–8). It is not to be understood as a form of Platonic or </p>
<p>proto-Cartesian thought (i.e., a sort of “ghost in the machine” metaphysics). </p>
<p>Rather, the spirit denotes the so-called orientation towards God, something </p>
<p>belonging to the order of the life-giving Spirit, or even the higher faculties </p>
<p>of a human being.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>In this light, Jesus is not speaking of a split between the</p>
<p>material and immaterial parts of a man, but the dilemma a man encounters </p>
<p>when temptations come his way.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p> Should he follow the directions of the di-</p>
<p>vine or should he succumb to his basal instincts? e weakness of the esh </p>
<p>can only be overcome by watching and praying. Mark informs his audience </p>
<p>that this injunction of Jesus is repeated twice (vv. 40–41). In all the cases, </p>
<p>the same results are obtained. e disciples are too sleepy to keep watch and </p>
<p>pray.</p>
<p>e incident at Gethsemane thus showcases the unswerving loyalty </p>
<p>of one person to the will of God, and the abject failure that humanity could </p>
<p>sink into at crunch time. Yet this failure must not be understood as some-</p>
<p>thing that would inevitably happen. An antidote has been given by the One </p>
<p>who stayed loyal to God’s will: watch and pray.</p>
<p>e Arrest (14:43–52)</p>
<p>Judas comes with people armed with swords and clubs. ey are to be iden-</p>
<p>tied as the Temple police and not the Roman soldiers.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>is was quite a</p>
<p>substantial force and well organized in Jesus’ day. e fact they are sent by </p>
<p>the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders demonstrates not </p>
<p>only that this is ocially sanctioned, but also what sort of people are against </p>
<p>Jesus: they belong to the powerful establishment in Jerusalem. Temple, </p>
<p>Torah (as interpreted by the best teachers), and tradition stand ready to </p>
<p>condemn him.</p>
<p>e pre-arranged signal for Jesus’ arrest is heavily ironic (v. 44), as the </p>
<p>kiss is commonly used for showing aection, or as a form of greeting, oen </p>
<p>given by a student to his rabbi.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p> Interestingly, in the midst of such com-</p>
<p>motion someone (John 18:10 tells us it is Peter) takes a sword and cuts o </p>
<p>152. Wol 1974: 32–39.</p>
<p>153. Marcus 2009: 979–80.</p>
<p>154. Boring 2006: 401; Collins 2007: 684. Regarding them as “a hired rabble” (Tay-</p>
<p>lor 1952: 558) is unnecessary and anachronistic.</p>
<p>155. See Marcus 2009: 991, for discussion on the possible nuances, concluding that </p>
<p>the kiss is merely a conventional form of greeting. We think there is no need to limit </p>
<p>the possibilities.</p>
