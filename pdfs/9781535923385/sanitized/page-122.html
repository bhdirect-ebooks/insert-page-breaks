<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>8:10–21104</p>
<p>whimsical or muddled. ere is a parallel tradition preserved by Q (Matt </p>
<p>12:38–41 || Luke 11:29–32), where it is said that a sign will nevertheless be </p>
<p>given and this is the sign of Jonah. is raises many interesting historical </p>
<p>and literary questions but our concern is with Mark.</p>
<p>e Pharisees Demand a Sign (8:10–13)</p>
<p>e name Dalmanutha does not appear in any other ancient source, and </p>
<p>we are le with absolutely no knowledge of where it was. is is why in the </p>
<p>manuscript tradition some other names are suggested: Mageda, Magdala, </p>
<p>Magada, and even Melegada. But the earliest and the most-widely attested </p>
<p>reading is Dalmanutha. Based on the data provided by this episode, and </p>
<p>especially v. 11 (a crossing of the lake and the appearance of Pharisees; or, </p>
<p>a crossing from Decapolis to a place where Jews may be found predomi-</p>
<p>nantly), scholars conjecture that this unknown place should be located on </p>
<p>the western shore of the Sea of Galilee.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p>Much may be seen as lurking below the surface of this brief story, </p>
<p>comprising mainly a question and answer session. Mark shows what sort </p>
<p>of motive the Pharisees have by the use of peirazō (v. 11). In Mark’s Gospel </p>
<p>this word is reserved only for Satan (1:13) and the Pharisees (together with </p>
<p>the Herodians in 12:15). e upshot of this is that the Pharisees are grouped </p>
<p>together with Satan in their testing of Jesus.</p>
<p>But how exactly are the Pharisees testing Jesus? e sign they ask </p>
<p>for is “from heaven” (v. 11). is can mean something performed by God </p>
<p>(i.e., heaven being a circumlocution for God)</p>
<p>185</p>
<p>or something done to the</p>
<p>heavens (i.e., a celestial sign).</p>
<p>186</p>
<p>However, it clearly refers to something that</p>
<p>will conrm Jesus’ claims once and for all.</p>
<p>187</p>
<p>It bears mentioning in this</p>
<p>connection that Mark has been careful with his vocabulary. He has referred </p>
<p>to Jesus’ miracles mainly as dynamis but never as sēmeion, which is now </p>
<p>the word used for denoting what the Pharisees are requesting to be done. </p>
<p>According to the background of the Second Temple period, many Jews were </p>
<p>frequently looking out for harbingers of God’s decisive intervention in his-</p>
<p>tory.</p>
<p>188</p>
<p>In this regard, Jews speculated that when the Messiah nally came</p>
<p>he would perform such a sign. is had a precedent in Moses’ ministry, </p>
