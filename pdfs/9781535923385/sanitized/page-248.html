<p>A Sketch of Mark’s eology</p>
<p>230</p>
<p>is the covenantal story of God and his people. e prophets looked to a time </p>
<p>when Yahweh the bridegroom would return and marry Israel once again. If </p>
<p>this is indeed the background for Jesus’ answer, what he is then saying is that </p>
<p>his ministry brings about this marriage.</p>
<p>As a spin-o from the concept of Jesus’ ministry as the climax of the </p>
<p>covenant, we can more properly understand what it means to describe Jesus’ </p>
<p>ministry as eschatological. It is not eschatological in the sense that it brings </p>
<p>about the end of the world or human history. Instead, it is eschatological </p>
<p>in the sense that what has been predicted and longed-for in the ongoing </p>
<p>story of God and his people has reached its climactic point in Jesus. At </p>
<p>this climactic point, God cuts a new or eternal covenant with his people, a </p>
<p>covenant that brings about all the attendant blessings and ramications for </p>
<p>them, and for his creation. e relational aspect of God’s program receives </p>
<p>the dominant beat.</p>
<p>The Kingdom of God</p>
<p>e kingdom of God is the primary theme of Jesus’ message (1:14–15).</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>As</p>
<p>it is true for Jesus’ identity, this theme is also eshed out with recourse to </p>
<p>Scriptures. Hence, the arrival of God’s kingdom means the fulllment of his </p>
<p>promises found in Scriptures. In this regard, the Book of Isaiah plays a key </p>
<p>role.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>is kingdom is eschatological in nature, signaling God’s return to</p>
<p>his people and their restoration to their true elect status, with ramications </p>
<p>for the created order, including both ora and fauna. It is another way of </p>
<p>saying that Yahweh has returned to Zion.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>What is fascinating is that the kingdom is presented as coming in the </p>
<p>future, and in some sense as having already arrived in Jesus’ ministry, al-</p>
<p>beit in hidden form.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Such a notion supports the importance of faith, as</p>
<p>only the eyes of faith may perceive its presence in Jesus’ ministry.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>is is</p>
<p>made clear in chapter 4, which contains mainly seed parables. Seed is the </p>
<p>appropriate image because its planting in the ground speaks of hiddenness, </p>
<p>and its smallness speaks of how the kingdom begins. If we are to stay with </p>
<p>Jesus’ botanical imagery, we may say that for many Jews the kingdom should </p>
<p>come as a full-grown tree, transplanted from heaven to earth,</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>and not as a</p>
