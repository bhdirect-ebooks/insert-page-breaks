<p>Gethsemane and the Arrest of Jesus 199</p>
<p>opening words of Jesus’ speech to his disciples echo the refrain found in </p>
<p>Psalms 42–43 (42:5, 11; 43:5), which are psalms of lament. Mark also pro-</p>
<p>vides his audience with the content of Jesus’ prayer for the rst time, even </p>
<p>though he has earlier referred to his habit (1:35; 6:46).</p>
<p>Jesus addresses God as “Abba,” and this word is found only once in </p>
<p>Mark’s Gospel (14:36). ere is good evidence to show that this Aramaic </p>
<p>word represents an intimate form of address,</p>
<p>150</p>
<p> notwithstanding the stric-</p>
<p>tures of James Barr,</p>
<p>151</p>
<p>although it must be pointed out that its use is not</p>
<p>limited only to children. e combination of an Aramaic term with the </p>
<p>translation “Father” appears also in Paul’s writings, which were addressed </p>
<p>to people who spoke Greek (Rom 8:15–16; Gal 4:6). is implies that the </p>
<p>term “Abba” has become theologically loaded, and used for describing the </p>
<p>Christian’s relationship with God. is further implies there must be some-</p>
<p>thing quite distinctive with the way it was used by Jesus in order for it to </p>
<p>gain such signicance. All this explains why when a translation is provided </p>
<p>the original term is not expunged.</p>
<p>Addressing God as “Abba” sets Jesus’ request on a familial tone of </p>
<p>trust. e specic request is for the cup to be removed, predicated upon </p>
<p>the understanding that all things are possible with the Father. However, the </p>
<p>request is also qualied by submission to the Father’s will. All this indicates </p>
<p>clearly the struggle that Jesus is going through. What is the cup he seeks to </p>
<p>avoid?</p>
<p>We suggested the metaphor of cup in 10:38–39 stood for the destiny </p>
to which one had been divinely appointed, whether it meant blessing or
<p>judgment. Drawing upon this insight, we may then conclude that for Jesus </p>
<p>to struggle with this cup must mean it speaks of his suering, perhaps even </p>
<p>his suering of wrath—certainly not for his wrongdoing but for the sins </p>
<p>of many (cf. 10:45). If this is correct, we can then understand what sort of </p>
<p>ordeal Jesus is going through. He is expecting not just any kind of suering </p>
<p>to come to him but that which is somehow linked with the wrath of God. </p>
<p>Holiness that reaches out to cleanse and heal can only make a person recoil </p>
at the prospect of divine wrath. But how could this be if God is Jesus’ Abba?
<p>e riddle is solved when we remember the Son of Man comes to give his </p>
<p>life as a ransom for many (10:45).</p>
<p>Upon returning to his disciples, Jesus nds them sleeping (v. 37). Je-</p>
<p>sus’ rebuke is stinging: the disciples are not able to keep watch even for an </p>
<p>hour. Peter is specially singled out, and for good reason. He has already been </p>
<p>warned about his frailty, and should therefore be even more watchful. e </p>
