<p>e Eschatological Discourse ontheMountofOlives 183</p>
<p>e disciples are to stand rm on the teaching that the Messiah’s “ar-</p>
<p>rival” (for the disciples, this is the “return”) will not take place during those </p>
<p>events. When he comes in the clouds with great power he will be seen by all, </p>
<p>so there will be no need to depend on reports. Read in this way, the contro-</p>
<p>versial vv. 24–27 can then be seen as answering the need of the disciples to </p>
<p>know when the Parousia will take place. </p>
<p>Verse 23 indicates the intent of Jesus in the discourse up to this stage. </p>
<p>is is to inform his disciples of the things to come that are connected to </p>
<p>the Temple, ahead of time. is will, in turn, help the disciples to be on their </p>
<p>guard so that they will not be led astray.</p>
<p>e Parousia of the Son of Man (13:24–27)</p>
<p>is section bristles with diculties. It is laden with scriptural language, </p>
<p>and should be seen as metaphorical in many ways. But what it is a metaphor </p>
<p>of is precisely the question. To unravel this, we start with the time indicators </p>
<p>of v. 24.</p>
<p>e strong adversative “but” (the Greek is alla) is eminently appropri-</p>
<p>ate for referring to a new phase in the eschatological drama. Furthermore, </p>
<p>the phrase “in those days” echoes the temporal formula found in many OT </p>
<p>prophecies that speak of the eschaton (Jer 3:16; 33:15–16; Joel 3:2; Zech </p>
<p>8:23).</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>To be sure, the phrase also has an exact parallel in verses 17 and</p>
<p>19, which refer to the days of tribulation. is may suggest that what is be-</p>
<p>ing described in vv. 24–27 may be construed as belonging to those events. </p>
<p>However, the phrase that follows on its heels is “aer the distress,” indicating </p>
<p>that a new phase to the eschatological drama is being envisaged.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>Hence,</p>
<p>the destruction of the Temple is not to be confused with the coming of the </p>
<p>Son of Man.</p>
<p>e metaphorical language is taken from Isa 13:10 and 34:4. In their </p>
<p>original contexts the oracles speak of the destruction of Babylon and Edom </p>
<p>respectively. is has led some scholars to associate such images only with </p>
<p>the destruction of cities.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>It may then be argued that the phrases should</p>
<p>refer to the destruction of Jerusalem. However, a closer inspection shows </p>
<p>that such phrases are not invariably connected with the destruction of cities, </p>
<p>but with theophanies in which God suddenly appears in great power either </p>
<p>to judge or to save (see especially Isa 13:9, 11 and 34:2, 8).</p>
