<p>Fusing the Horizons16</p>
<p>Evangelistic endeavors in our world may take a leaf from Mark’s book. </p>
<p>Too often the gospel is presented in a garb that comes from another time </p>
<p>or culture. We must, instead, seek ways to use signiﬁcant terms in our time </p>
<p>and culture to present the gospel. The rich theological terms of yesteryears, </p>
<p>or from a far country, would simply pass our generation by if we do not make </p>
<p>the effort to connect. In this light, the gospel message is not a mantra to be </p>
<p>repeated but a performance that needs creative re-enactments.</p>
<p>This does not mean we are merely repeating what is fashionable. </p>
<p>Rather, we are to use it as contact points or for subversion. In this sense, </p>
<p>while the gospel can indeed be quickly understood, it is still a challeng-</p>
<p>ing message, as it calls people to abandon old and entrenched patterns </p>
<p>of thinking and living in order to embrace the new and liberating. Hence, </p>
<p>gospel preaching cannot just be about packaging, important as this may be. </p>
<p>The content is supremely important, for it is this that will ultimately subvert </p>
<p>and transform. To reiterate what was adumbrated earlier: we need creative </p>
<p>performances, but such performances are also to be re-enactments, follow-</p>
<p>ing the plot but with different props.</p>
<p>Mark’s prologue indicates that the content of gospel preaching is to be </p>
<p>informed by the story of Jesus Christ. This is the reference point. As such </p>
<p>it serves as a challenge to how the gospel is being presented today. We </p>
<p>may mention here, as an example, the weekly sermons of some churches </p>
<p>where the focus is on how their members may be healthy or wealthy. God is </p>
<p>presented as the doting, generous Creator and we are therefore fools if we </p>
<p>remain sickly or poor. Such a counterfeit message contradicts Mark’s pre-</p>
<p>sentation of his central character and actually sounds more like the gospels </p>
<p>of the Caesars.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Such gospels certainly brought material beneﬁt, but often</p>
<p>only for a select group: the rich and powerful, the decision makers and the </p>
<p>investors. Never mind the cries of the powerless many. Sadly, Christians may </p>
<p>be complicit in such matters. As long as business or governmental schemes </p>
<p>can enrich us, we are tempted to take them as God’s blessing, without </p>
<p>considering whether they are moral or just. Any gospel preaching that takes </p>
<p>our eyes away from Christ must therefore be treated with suspicion.</p>
<p>12. Cf. the contribution of Horsley 2002: 137–47, where he has the gumption to </p>
<p>equate the United States of America with the rapacious Roman Empire, leading to </p>
<p>angry reactions from some quarters. We think, however, authentic Gospel preaching </p>
<p>should sometimes be disturbing, making us realize that the enemy is not out there, but </p>
<p>within, and may very well be ourselves.</p>
