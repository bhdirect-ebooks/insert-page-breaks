<p>e Kingdom in Parables 59</p>
<p>as being “on the outside” are the relatives of Jesus. at said, Mark would </p>
<p>surely know that James, the Lord’s brother, did come to trust in Jesus aer </p>
<p>his resurrection! is means the “outsiders” can become “insiders.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the way forward is to start from Isa 6:9–10 and acknowledge </p>
<p>that the harshness in Mark 4:10–12 comes mainly from the quoted words. </p>
<p>Our preferred interpretation is therefore option 2. It retains the telic idea, </p>
<p>which is suggested not simply by the Greek hina but also by the way the story </p>
is told. is intention is the divine intention, connected with the words used
<p>by Isaiah on the obdurate nation just before her exile. e full force of this </p>
<p>obduracy has yet to be unleashed, and Jesus’ ministry does precisely that, </p>
<p>fullling Scripture (i.e., making it full).</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>It will attract rank stubbornness to</p>
<p>itself. All this is part of God’s plan and may be construed as the secret of the </p>
<p>kingdom. Of course, the Isaianic quotation need not be regarded as total-</p>
<p>izing. Other aspects must be brought in to ensure a full-orbed view of Jesus’ </p>
<p>ministry. e fact that Jesus appealed to people to hear does not indicate </p>
<p>that fatalism is at work.</p>
<p>at said, we must not miss an important implication here, which </p>
<p>actually undergirds the whole of 4:1–34: the kingdom works in the midst </p>
<p>of great rebellion without cancelling it, at least not yet. Hence, there is a </p>
division among the people, making them into insiders and outsiders. Fur-
<p>thermore, Jesus’ ministry is seen as eschatological, drawing together the </p>
<p>dierent narrative threads of the biblical story, both positive and negative. </p>
<p>Hence salvation is announced together with judgment (and Mark will have </p>
<p>more to say about this later).</p>
<p>e Interpretation of the Parable (4:13–20)</p>
<p>Jesus’ questions in v. 13 make explicit the hermeneutical signicance of the </p>
<p>Parable of the Sower. It provides the key to unlocking the meaning of all </p>
<p>Jesus’ parables.</p>
<p>Jesus’ explanation of the parable begins with the all-important sen-</p>
<p>tence that guides us to its meaning: it is about the sowing of the word.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e soils are only part of the message. If this is missed, then this parable </p>
<p>has been domesticated of all its revolutionary eect. e importance of the </p>
<p>word is also suggested by its frequent occurrence in the explanation.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>absolute form “the word” is never found in the OT; it is always qualied </p>
<p>by another noun or in a genitival relationship with something else. How-</p>
<p>93. Cf. Schneck 1994: 114–23.</p>
<p>94. Cf. the keen observations in Marcus 2000: 308, 311.</p>
<p>95. Eight times out of twenty-four, a third of the total usage of the Gospel of Mark.</p>
