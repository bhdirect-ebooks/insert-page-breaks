<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>12:1–44168</p>
<p>e upshot of all this is that Torah and theology combine to give a </p>
<p>resounding yes to resurrection. Covenant and community must mean that </p>
<p>those who die in the Lord will not miss out when the denouement comes. </p>
<p>e character of God guarantees this, for he does not wish to be known as </p>
<p>the God of people who have long died. He is the God of the living.</p>
<p>e Greatest Commandment (12:28–34)</p>
<p>From the way Mark introduces this story, we may regard it as a sequel to the </p>
<p>previous one. e scribe’s question concerns the greatest commandment of </p>
<p>Torah, just as the Sadducees’ objection arose because of their intention to </p>
<p>safeguard Torah. at said, the scribe’s question is in itself signicant, as </p>
<p>similar questions have been asked before.Jews want to know what the heart </p>
<p>of Torah is, as there are many commandments and regulations. So whenever </p>
<p>there is a conict of laws, the enquirer will know which has priority.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> Fur-</p>
<p>thermore, what really constitutes membership in the covenant will also be </p>
<p>claried. Indeed, the rabbi Hillel was asked a similar question: whether he </p>
<p>could teach the whole of Torah while the learner was standing on one leg. </p>
<p>His reply was: “Do not do to your neighbor what is hateful to you; this is the </p>
<p>whole of Torah: the rest is commentary.”</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>Jesus cites what is known as the Shema.is comes from a Hebrew </p>
<p>word that means “hear,” and it serves as a peg for hanging the whole passage </p>
<p>of Deut 6:4–5. e Shema may be regarded as the key confession of Israel, </p>
<p>in which her covenantal status is summed up,and adherence to it marks her </p>
<p>out as the special people of God (cf. Wisd 11–15; SibOr 3:8–45; Josephus </p>
<p>Antiquities 5:1, 27, 112; Philo, Decal. 65). Deuteronomy 6:4–9 is also com-</p>
<p>bined with 11:13–21 and Num 15:37–41 to form the whole creed. In b. Suk. </p>
<p>42a, we are told that once boys can speak, they will be taught the rst line of </p>
<p>the Shema (Deut 6:4).</p>
<p>In the Shema the fundamental belief and the primary praxis of Israel </p>
<p>are given. e fundamental belief is that there is only one God, Yahweh </p>
<p>(monotheism). e fundamental praxis for Israel to be truly monotheistic </p>
<p>is to love this God with all her heart and all her soul and all her strength. </p>
<p>Jesus includes “all your mind” (v. 30) for good measure, probably to connect </p>
<p>with his interlocutor who is a scribe and is learned in the ways of Torah. </p>
<p>As a scribe he has to think hard on what it means to love God truly. e </p>
<p>61. Which commandments were “heavy” (i.e., important), and which were “light” </p>
<p>were discussed by rabbis. See b. Ber. 63a and b. Mak. 24a.</p>
<p>62. is is found in b. Šab 31a; cf. Rabbi Akiba’s statement in Sipre Lev. §200<span class="ws91"> (on </span></p>
<p>Lev 19:15–20).</p>
