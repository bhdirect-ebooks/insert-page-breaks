<p>what it may be. So we must take a closer look at the action performed in the </p>
<p>Temple, before coming back to unravel the meaning of this strange episode.</p>
<p>Of course, one way of ameliorating Jesus’ seemingly vindictive action </p>
<p>is to appeal to botany. Some claim that the g tree sprouts fruits rst (the </p>
<p>paggîm) before the leaves, and that these fruits would later ripen aer the </p>
<p>leaves have appeared. So the sight of a g tree in bloom may indicate to </p>
<p>Jesus that unripe fruits may at least be found. While not pleasant to the </p>
<p>palate, they are still edible (m. Sheni. 4:7).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Mark’s comment that it is not</p>
<p>the season for fruits is correct as the full development of these early fruits </p>
<p>will come later. So it is not unreasonable of Jesus to expect to nd fruit on </p>
<p>the g tree aer the leaves have sprouted. Such an explanation ameliorates </p>
<p>a lot of the negative reactions to this story, and to some extent it is a good </p>
<p>thing. However, it has not yet grappled with the symbolism Mark wants his </p>
<p>audience to see. We must take a closer look at the Temple episode in order </p>
<p>to grasp fully the message Mark intends for his audience.</p>
<p>e Action in the Temple (11:15–19)</p>
<p>e action of Jesus in the Temple has generated much controversy in recent </p>
<p>scholarship, particularly over the symbolic meaning that he intended to </p>
<p>convey.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Many competing theories have been propounded and to examine</p>
<p>them all is too big a task for this commentary. What we shall do instead is </p>
<p>look at the data Mark provides and from there, oer our line of interpreta-</p>
<p>tion. e data to be considered are the following:</p>
<p>(i) e signicance of the Temple for Jewish self-understanding; </p>
<p>(ii) First-century realities pertaining to Jewish worship; </p>
<p>(iii) Elements of Jesus’ one action: driving out those buying and sell-</p>
<p>ing; overturning tables of money-changers; overturning benches of </p>
<p>the dove-sellers; not allowing anyone to carry a vessel through the </p>
<p>temple courts; </p>
<p>(iv) OT quotations: Isa 56:7 and Jer 7:11; </p>
<p>(v) e reaction of the Temple authorities; and </p>
<p>(vi) e action’s connection with the cursing of the g tree.</p>
<p>e Jewish Temple is a national symbol for God’s presence and Israel’s elec-</p>
<p>tion (i.e., her special identity over against other nations). As such, it is also </p>
<p>used as a symbol of resistance to the inroads made by Hellenization and </p>
<p>10. Hunzinger 1997: 7:753; Bishop 1955: 217.</p>
<p>11. Sanders 1985 brought this to the fore of scholarship on the historical Jesus. Ev-</p>
<p>ans 2001 provides a good summary.</p>
