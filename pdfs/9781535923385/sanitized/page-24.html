<p>Introduction6</p>
<p>Mark was sent to Alexandria aer he had written his Gospel in Rome.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Epiphanius’s testimony supports this, with the additional detail that it was </p>
<p>Peter who sent him there.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Interestingly, a handful of scholars have argued that Mark was com-</p>
<p>posed in Syria-Palestine.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>However, no external testimony supports it. e</p>
<p>case is derived from internal evidence, inferring from passages such as 7:31 </p>
<p>and 15:21.</p>
<p>If the Gospel of Mark has a Roman provenance, we may presume Mark </p>
<p>is writing for a Roman audience, particularly the church at Rome. Much of </p>
<p>Markan scholarship then utilizes this assumption to reconstruct the prole </p>
<p>of the community to which Mark is writing. He mentions some details such </p>
<p>as the young man who ed naked (14:52), and Simon of Cyrene (15:51–52) </p>
<p>who is also described as the father of Alexander and Rufus. ese details </p>
<p>would interest only a particular community.</p>
<p>ere are, however, other considerations to bear in mind. Recently, </p>
<p>Bauckham has argued that unlike the letters, the Gospels are meant for a </p>
<p>wider circulation, and not just for one community.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>e ably-argued case</p>
<p>need not be rehearsed here. Consider the itineraries of the apostles, the </p>
<p>frequent communication between churches, and the fact that we could not </p>
<p>expect an elaborate work such as Mark’s Gospel to be written only for a </p>
<p>community of about y to one hundred Christians. at said, Bauckham’s </p>
<p>case must be balanced against the quaint details found in Mark. e resul-</p>
<p>tant picture is that of a writing that has been shaped by a specic audience, </p>
<p>but without limiting itself to that audience.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Mark certainly wrote for his</p>
<p>immediate community but he also had in mind Christians all over the Em-</p>
<p>pire who might nd his writing benecial and edifying.</p>
<p>Occasion and Purpose </p>
<p>To answer the questions of occasion and purpose we must depend sub-</p>
<p>stantially on our reconstruction of the origin of the writing, especially the </p>
<p>dating, the provenance, and the audience. But the text itself may also play </p>
<p>a part.</p>
<p>It has frequently been observed that Mark’s Gospel shows a heightened </p>
<p>interest in discipleship, focusing especially on the suering awaiting them, </p>
