<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>13:1–37186</p>
<p>sense of imminence doubly clear, Jesus pronounces that “this generation </p>
<p>will not pass away until all these things happen” (v. 30). e solemnity of </p>
<p>this pronouncement is indicated by the formula “Amen I say to you,” and the </p>
<p>declaration of the utter reliability of Jesus’ words, the permanence of which </p>
<p>exceeds that of creation (Isa 40:7–8; 51:6; 54:9–10; Jer 33:20–21).</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>e statement of v. 30 therefore impresses on Jesus’ disciples that he is </p>
<p>not making one last bid for respectability by predicting events what would </p>
<p>come to pass only aer hundreds of years, where no one present would be </p>
<p>able to check on the authenticity. Rather, the generation hearing these words </p>
<p>from Jesus would be present when they happened. is being the case, in-</p>
<p>terpretations which speak of the last generation before the Second Coming </p>
<p>of Christ</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>or that the Jewish race would never perish actually miss the</p>
<p>whole point.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>Our proposal enables us to see that Jesus is not playing mind</p>
<p>games with his disciples, but he is actually answering their questions in a </p>
<p>very relevant way.</p>
<p>e Unknowable Hour (13:32–37)</p>
<p>e present section speaks of the coming of the Son of Man. Otherwise, </p>
<p>the section sits uncomfortably with the previous one because that section </p>
<p>clearly gave a time-frame, while the present passage is agnostic about it. </p>
<p>One possible harmonization is to construe Jesus as knowing roughly when </p>
<p>(i.e., in a generation’s time), but not exactly when. However, this seems a </p>
<p>ponderous way of stating it. We prefer to regard the time horizon as having </p>
<p>been switched to the Parousia, and will now seek to justify it.</p>
<p>As we pointed out earlier, the destruction of the Temple and the Par-</p>
<p>ousia, although separate events, are conceptually related. Furthermore, we </p>
<p>note many grammatical indicators that point in the direction of a change </p>
<p>in time-horizon. e opening two words in Greek (peri de) are oen used </p>
<p>as a section marker or a break in a discourse (cf. 12:26 and especially 1 </p>
<p>111. We take the “words” to refer to the entire discourse (pace Craneld 1959). </p>
<p>Again, high Christology is implied here, as in the OT only God’s word has this quality, </p>
<p>and not that of mortal man. Some have construed that Jesus is equating his words with </p>
<p>Torah. Even so, it must be borne in mind that Torah is eternal only (Bar. 4:1; Wisd 18:4) </p>
<p>because it is regarded as given by God.</p>
<p>112. As France observes, if this is what Jesus intended, shouldn’t he have said “that </p>
<p>generation,” rather than “this generation”? Moreover, it makes the expression trite, since </p>
<p>by denition there would always be a last generation to welcome Jesus’ Second Coming </p>
<p>(see France 2002: 539). Cf. the remark of Gundry: “Of course this generation would not </p>
<p>pass away if by denition it could extend out indenitely!” (Gundry 1993: 791).</p>
<p>113. Construing genea as “race,” an interpretation which may be traced back to </p>
<p>Jerome (see France 2002: 539).</p>
