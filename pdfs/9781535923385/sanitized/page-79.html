<p>e Kingdom in Parables 61</p>
<p>e two sayings that follow speak of accountability and judgment. In other </p>
<p>words, what is being heard is not a run-of-the-mill thing, because there will </p>
<p>be a great day of reckoning.</p>
<p>e Greek mēti erchetai ho lychnos is oen translated as “do you bring </p>
<p>in a lamp,” which is also supported by many commentaries, but it actually </p>
<p>obscures a powerful Markan theme at work. e Greek erchomai is almost </p>
<p>always deponent, and should be translated with an English verb in its active </p>
<p>voice,</p>
<p>98</p>
<p> unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>is being the case, Mark’s statement</p>
<p>actually speaks of the lamp’s coming. In the OT the lamp is an image for </p>
<p>God’s word (Ps 119:105), and it is used to signify the illuminative or revela-</p>
<p>tory aspect of his word. Since Jesus provides the world with new revelation, </p>
<p>Mark may very well have Jesus in mind too.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>e implication of the lamp’s coming is spelled out in v. 22, and it pro-</p>
<p>vides the counterpoint to the parable theory of 4:10–12: it is always God’s </p>
<p>intention for full clarity to come. e hiding is only a phase, and is subservi-</p>
<p>ent to the larger interest of revelation.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>is means the kingdom will nally</p>
<p>be tangibly experienced. So important is this truth that the exhortation to </p>
<p>hear, sounded at the end of the Parable of the Sower (v. 9) is repeated here (v. </p>
<p>23). Although it is not stated when clarity will come, in Mark’s Gospel this is </p>
<p>either Jesus’ crucixion and resurrection, or his coming again.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>One may</p>
<p>then speak of a christological resolution of the kingdom’s enigma.</p>
<p>A dierent image is conjured up with v. 24. e Greek blepete ti akouete </p>
<p>aptly juxtaposes the senses of seeing and hearing. In the Markan context, </p>
<p>seeing is an important activity especially when it is related to the things that </p>
<p>are happening in Jesus’ ministry (8:15, 18, 22–26; 12:14). Why it is impor-</p>
<p>tant to “watch what you hear” is explained with the use of the metaphor of </p>
<p>a measure. An escalation of the lex talionis principle may be detected here. </p>
<p>What it means is that the negative judgments people pass on Jesus’ ministry </p>
<p>will result in negative judgments being passed on them. But because of the </p>
<p>eschatological and salvic signicance of Jesus’ ministry, these future judg-</p>
<p>ments will be innitely more severe than what they themselves are passing </p>
<p>on Jesus.</p>
<p>On the surface the saying of v. 25 appears rather capricious, but when </p>
<p>it is understood in its particular context, it makes good sense. ose who </p>
<p>98. is means “does the lamp come?”</p>
<p>99. e parallels in Matthew and Luke (Matt 5:15; Luke 8:16; 11:33) use dierent </p>
<p>verbs (Matthew uses kaiō and tithēmi, and Luke haptō and tithēmi).</p>
