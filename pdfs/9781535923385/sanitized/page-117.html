<p>“All Foods Made Clean” and the Extension of the Ministry to Gentiles 99</p>
<p>of grace, a grace that can benet even those who are outside God’s current </p>
<p>program, so to speak. Priority therefore does not necessarily mean water-</p>
<p>tight exclusivity. What leads her to do this must surely be attributed to faith, </p>
<p>which Matthew the evangelist duly informs us that it is so (Matt 15:28).</p>
<p>We can therefore posit that Jesus intentionally drops clues for further </p>
<p>thought, and invites engagement.</p>
<p>174</p>
<p> Being a wise teacher, Jesus is encourag-</p>
<p>ing her to argue, with the hope that in the process certain powerful insights </p>
<p>will open up. Indeed, he has provided enough ammunition for her to de-</p>
<p>stroy his own case.</p>
<p>To summarize: this episode ties together masterfully the Jewishness of </p>
<p>Jesus and the worldwide ecacy of his ministry that is still future. In this </p>
<p>regard, Mark’s audience will understand why Jesus spent most of his time </p>
<p>reaching out to the Jews, even if he is to be the ruler of this world. ey will </p>
<p>further understand why this does not mean Gentiles are neglected. Crumbs </p>
<p>from the table may still be eaten by dogs. But the day will come when these </p>
<p>dogs will be children, and sit together with other children at the great ban-</p>
<p>quet of reconciliation and renewal.</p>

<p>e Deaf and Speech-impaired Man (7:31–36)</p>
<p>e story of the healing of the man who is deaf and speech-impaired is </p>
<p>unique to Mark’s Gospel. It reinforces the theme of the previous episode by </p>
<p>showing that Jesus’ kingdom ministry is also available to Gentiles.</p>
<p>e travel itinerary given by Mark seems odd. Sidon was to the north </p>
<p>of Tyre, while the Sea of Galilee lay in the southeast (v. 31). Furthermore, </p>
<p>the Decapolis was on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. e itiner-</p>
<p>ary envisaged by Mark involves going rst to the north and then turning </p>
<p>around to head in a south-easterly direction for the Decapolis. Why this is </p>
<p>so, Mark does not explain. If Jesus wanted to give himself as wide a berth </p>
<p>as possible from Antipas’s kingdom, there was no need to head north rst. </p>
<p>From this rather strange itinerary, some scholars have concluded Mark does </p>
<p>not know his geography.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, there arose a textual variant,</p>
<p>which speaks of Jesus not as departing Tyre for Sidon but as departing the </p>
<p>Tyre-Sidon region and heading for Galilee. is has early support (P45, </p>
<p>from the third century), but most scholars deem this reading as second-</p>
<p>ary, based mainly on the consideration of transcriptional probability (i.e., </p>
<p>174. Pokorný 1995: 321–37, suggesting it is a test of faith.</p>
<p>175. e recent thesis of Alonso argues along a similar line, positing that with this </p>
<p>episode, Mark invites his readers to cross boundaries; see Alonso 2011.</p>
