<p>e Climax of the Gospel</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>12:1–44170</p>
<p>e Messiah and David (12:35–37)</p>
<p>Mark depicts Jesus as the one now asking questions, breaking a pattern </p>
<p>found in the earlier episodes. Jesus’ question relates to his identity, using </p>
<p>Ps 110:1 as the basis.is is signicant, as the Psalm has been understood </p>
<p>as a messianic psalm (cf. 11Q13), and plays an important role in helping </p>
<p>the early Christians understand Jesus’ identity (cf. 1 Cor 15:25–27; Eph </p>
<p>1:20–22; Heb 1:13—2:8).</p>
<p>e essence of Jesus’ question seems to be: “How is David’s son also </p>
<p>David’s lord?” Some background information is necessary to grasp the full </p>
<p>signicance of the question. Many Jews assume the Messiah will be from </p>
<p>David’s line. In this sense he is known as David’s son (Pss Sol 17:21). It is </p>
<p>also assumed by many Jews, and Jesus himself, that Psalm 110 is written </p>
<p>by David. ese two assumptions are brought together to frame a question </p>
<p>that seeks to open up new vistas. David in that Psalm refers to his lord, who </p>
<p>in v. 1 is being addressed by God himself. God invites this person to sit at </p>
<p>his right hand, indicating he will have dominion over the world, and his </p>
<p>enemies will be put under his feet. In Jewish theology the one to do this is </p>
<p>identied as the Messiah, who will come from David’s line (i.e., be David’s </p>
<p>son). If all this is true, how can David’s son be called lord by David?</p>
<p>We can see what Jesus is driving at. is Messiah who will come to </p>
<p>usher in God’s rule cannot merely be known as the son of David, since Da-</p>
<p>vid the great king addresses him as lord. Indeed, the Psalm that Jesus refers </p>
<p>to speaks later of this lord as a priest of the order of Melchizedek, an order </p>
<p>of eternal priesthood. What categories are then le for understanding the </p>
<p>Messiah? Mark does not answer this in this passage but he has said enough </p>
<p>in earlier passages for his audience to understand that Jesus bursts asunder </p>
<p>the boundaries of messiahship traditionally established. He, the chosen Son </p>
<p>of God, is also the One who shares some of God’s special prerogatives.</p>
<p>Mark tells us that the characters in the story listen to this with delight </p>
<p>(v. 37), but he will show later that they, too, have not grasped the actual </p>
<p>answer that Jesus’ question prompts.</p>
<p>e Widow’s Mite (12:38–44)</p>
<p>Verses 12:38–40 and 12:41–44 are two scenes of one story. e rst contains </p>
<p>Jesus’ warning about the scribes, for they desire to be seen and honored </p>
<p>(vv. 38–39). In addition to this, they devour widows’ houses. Widows were </p>
<p>regarded as especially vulnerable in biblical times, as there was no social </p>
<p>security system as we know it. eir houses were oen their only means </p>
<p>of security and shelter. Defrauding them of this was the most despicable </p>
