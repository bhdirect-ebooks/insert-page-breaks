<p>human history. is character’s signicance is intimately connected to his </p>
<p>passion and death, and hence the nature of the focus. In this regard Mark is </p>
<p>not inventing a new genre. Later on, others emulated his writing, and such </p>
<p>writings became known as “Gospels” or churchly writings. It is only aer </p>
<p>this that one can speak of a new genre, or better, a sub-genre.</p>
<p>It may be claimed that Mark intended his writing to be read in the </p>
<p>setting of worship (cf. Acts 2:42; 5:42; Col 4:15). Moreover, literacy rates </p>
<p>were rather low in the ancient world.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>Hence Mark would have designed</p>
<p>his work not for self-study but to be read aloud to Christian communities </p>
<p>gathered at worship. Certain features of Mark’s text demonstrate this. His </p>
<p>style is vivid (e.g., Mark 14:32–52; compare this with the parallel accounts </p>
<p>in Matthew and Luke), and is oen replete with dual expressions—a feature </p>
<p>of oral communication and not formal writing. An example of this dual </p>
<p>expression is found in Mark 1:32, where the time of the event is described as </p>
<p>“evening, when the sun has set.” is may appear tautologous to the trained </p>
<p>eye of a good writer. But for oral communication, such dual expressions </p>
<p>make the message memorable. Furthermore, repetitiveness is a feature (e.g., </p>
<p>the threefold passion prediction: 8:31; 9:31; 10:33), which helps especially a </p>
<p>listening audience, who would not have the document to refer to. All these </p>
<p>stylistic devices are in keeping with a text written for oral presentation.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>Certain corollaries follow. First of all, it calls into question the many </p>
<p>complicated and convoluted chiastic structures proposed by scholars.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How could a listener perceive such grand schemes and structures which </p>
<p>are transparent only aer sustained analysis? at said, this criticism must </p>
<p>not be taken as rendering void all rhetorical studies of Mark’s text. Rather, </p>
<p>it is to say, secondly, that we should expect Mark to employ small-scale </p>
<p>techniques, utilizing small chunks of text so that the listener might not be </p>
<p>lost in a wealth of details. Indeed, Mark makes use of ashbacks, small-</p>
<p>scale chiastic structures, the sandwich technique for relating one story to </p>
<p>the other, suspense, paradox, and topical arrangements. Such techniques </p>
<p>hold the listeners’ interest, and help them to connect episodes or passages </p>
<p>so that a profounder message may be perceived. Finally, it suggests that the </p>
<p>structure of the book is straightforwardly simple and predominantly linear. </p>
<p>Our proposed structure will take this into account. But before this is oered, </p>
<p>27. e best authorities estimate literacy of the Roman Empire at around 10 percent </p>
<p>and that of Roman Palestine, around 3 percent. See Harris 1991: 22; and Hezser 2001: </p>
<p>25, 445–50, 496–500. Given the importance of learning Torah in Jewish culture, the </p>
<p>estimates might possibly be higher for Jewish Palestine. See Millard 2000.</p>

<p>29. Cf. Van Iersel 1989: 19–26, 75–86, who proposes elaborate concentric structures.</p>
