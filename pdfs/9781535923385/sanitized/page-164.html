<p>Excursus: e Suering Servant of Isaiah 53 and Mark 10:45</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>5. Finally, apart from the Fourth Servant Song in Isaiah 53, there </p>
<p>is no other biblical passage that comes close in terms of related themes </p>
<p>and terminology. So what is being urged here is that if we think of all this </p>
<p>cumulatively, the Fourth Servant Song stands as the best candidate for Mark </p>
<p>10:45, if ever there was a background to which the verse is alluding.</p>
<p>Restoring Bartimaeus’ Sight (10:46–52)</p>
<p>is story, the last of the healing accounts in Mark, serves as a symbolic </p>
<p>narrative, pointing to the possibility of the removal of spiritual blindness, </p>
<p>an aiction that has plagued the Twelve. Mark narrates only two stories of </p>
<p>restoring sight to the blind: the present story and the two-staged healing in </p>
<p>Decapolis (8:22–26). at story began the major section of 8:22—10:52 that </p>
<p>depicts Jesus on the road to Jerusalem. e present story concludes it. e </p>
<p>two stories of healing serve, then, as a framing device for the entire major </p>
<p>section, which has as its central concern the theme of discipleship and the </p>
<p>need to eradicate misguided notions.</p>
<p>e travelling company now arrives in Jericho, only about een </p>
<p>miles from Jerusalem. Jericho has been regarded as the oldest continually </p>
<p>inhabited city on earth. It was founded around 9,000 BC. Herod the Great </p>
<p>built a new city not far from the ancient site, and erected his palace and a </p>
<p>hippodrome there. He later died in this city.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>As they are about to leave the city</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>together with a large crowd, they</p>
<p>pass by a blind beggar by the name of Bartimaeus. Mark’s description of his </p>
<p>location as para tēn hodon indicates he is not yet a disciple. He is “beside </p>
<p>the way” but not on it yet. Later, he will be on it (en tē hodō, v. 52). Such </p>
<p>phraseology strengthens our belief that this story serves as a parable of </p>
<p>discipleship.</p>
<p>When Bartimaeus hears it is Jesus of Nazareth who is passing by, he </p>
<p>shouts, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” e term “Son of David” </p>
<p>does not simply indicate genealogy, but speaks also of the hope of the com-</p>
<p>ing scion of David who will rule over the nation (see excursus). Signicantly, </p>
<p>this title is used for the rst time for Jesus in Mark’s Gospel. Bartimaeus </p>
<p>55. Holland and Netzer 1992: 3:723–39.</p>
<p>56. In Luke Jesus meets a blind man (not named) as he is about to enter Jericho </p>
<p>(Luke 18:35). In Mark, Jesus meets blind Bartimaeus when he is about to leave. Mat-</p>
<p>thew follows Mark in the main, but he mentions two blind men (not named) instead </p>
<p>(Matt 20:29–30)! ese slight discrepancies should not distract us from the signicance </p>
<p>of the story in Mark.</p>
