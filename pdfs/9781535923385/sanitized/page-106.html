<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>6:31–5688</p>
<p>e really puzzling thing, then, is not that Mark is narrating a spec-</p>
<p>tacular miracle, but that he depicts Jesus as intending to pass the disciples </p>
<p>by (v. 48). e NIV reading (“he was about to pass by them”)</p>
<p>157</p>
<p>represents</p>
<p>an amelioration of a dicult idea. However, by so doing it has obscured the </p>
<p>signicance of the event. e Greek phrase (ēthelen parelthein autous) actu-</p>
<p>ally means “he intended to pass them by,” as thelō certainly denotes volition. </p>
<p>e question then comes, “Why would Jesus intend to pass the disciples by, </p>
<p>if his going to them by walking on the water was meant to help them?” Not </p>
<p>surprisingly, it has been proposed that the easiest way out of this conun-</p>
<p>drum (without resorting to improbable theories such as Jesus’ desiring to </p>
<p>overtake his disciples in getting to the other shore in order to surprise them) </p>
<p>is to think of the verb as representing the disciples’ perspective on Jesus’ </p>
<p>action.</p>
<p>158</p>
<p>ey thought he was trying to pass them by when actually he was</p>
<p>not. If this were correct, Mark expressed it rather clumsily. But there is no </p>
<p>reason to think Mark has been clumsy here. Once again, the OT background </p>
<p>provides a plausible solution to the problem. e verb parerchomai (to pass </p>
by) is used almost like a technical term in the LXX for a divine epiphany.
<p>e seedbed for such a usage is Exod 33:17—34:8. In this account, the verb </p>
<p>in question is used thrice—33:22 (twice) and 34:6—to depict God’s passing </p>
<p>by Moses (i.e., revealing his glory in a manner Moses has not seen before). </p>
Such a description of the divine epiphany is later utilized in the account of
<p>Elijah’s coming before God at Mt Horeb (1 Kings 19:11–13). Moreover, the </p>
<p>express mention of Jesus’ walking on the water is meant to be a parallel to </p>
<p>God’s walking on the sea (Job 9:8; Ps 77:19; Hab 3:15; cf. Sir 24:5–6), which </p>
<p>signies his sovereignty over chaotic forces. All this provides the answer to </p>
<p>Jesus’ strange intention. is is to provide a theophany so as to encourage </p>
<p>the disciples.</p>
<p>159</p>
<p>Jesus’ words “I am” in v. 50 further supports this interpretation. e </p>
<p>Greek expression egō eimi in the LXX translates the Hebrew ’anî hû’, which </p>
is used as the divine self-declaration of Israel’s God, in contexts where his
<p>unique sovereignty as the one and only God is emphasized (Exod 3:14; Deut </p>
32:39; Isa 41:4; 43:10–11). Not surprisingly, this divine self-declaration is
<p>also used in connection with commissioning or comforting because God’s </p>
<p>unique sovereignty is critical for assurance. Indeed, in Isaiah the words “I </p>
<p>am” or the claim of God’s sole supremacy are given to awaken faith in his </p>
<p>people, and comfort them in their dicult undertaking. So they are oen </p>
<p>coupled with the encouraging “Fear not” or “Take heart” (e.g., Isa 41:10, 13; </p>
<p>157. My emphasis.</p>
