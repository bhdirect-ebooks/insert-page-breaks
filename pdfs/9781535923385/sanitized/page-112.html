<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>7:1–2394</p>
<p>In tackling this unspoken question, the basic principle with which Jesus </p>
<p>contradicts the tradition held dearly by the Pharisees is disclosed.</p>
<p>Jesus turns to address the crowd (v. 14), signifying that what is to be </p>
<p>pronounced has great relevance for all. It denes what being unclean means. </p>
<p>Once this is understood, the crowd would know where deling sources </p>
<p>might be found. Jesus begins with the polar opposites of inside and outside. </p>
<p>He then denes uncleanness as not coming from the outside, but arising </p>
<p>from inside a person (v. 15). In essence, this relativizes ceremonial washing, </p>
<p>as the contagion is now regarded as coming from the inside and not the </p>
<p>outside.</p>
<p>To clarify this notion further, Mark moves the scene to inside the </p>
<p>house (v. 17). Whose house it is does not really matter. It is more impor-</p>
<p>tant to recognize that in Mark’s Gospel, the house is the locality for special </p>
<p>teaching to be given to a privileged group, namely Jesus’ disciples. So in the </p>
<p>house Jesus’ disciples ask him about the dark saying or riddle (the Greek is </p>
<p>parabolē). is is similar to the situation envisaged in 4:10–12. Perhaps the </p>
<p>unspoken question they have is: “If delement is from the inside, won’t this </p>
<p>make nonsense of the whole purity code?” What justication does Jesus </p>
<p>have for dening deling sources as internal and not external?</p>
<p>Jesus’ answer to that implied question has sometimes been interpreted </p>
<p>as being humorous, referring to what takes place naturally in the toilet:</p>
<p>167</p>
<p> </p>
<p>undigested food, pure or impure, is passed out of the system and into the </p>
<p>latrine (vv. 18–19). But there may be something more profound going on. </p>
<p>Verse 19 tells us that food does not aect the heart, which is the seat of </p>
<p>personality in ancient thought.</p>
<p>168</p>
<p>In this regard, we can see that the heart</p>
<p>of the matter is the heart. It is this that gives rise to impure thoughts and </p>
<p>actions, making people really impure (vv. 20–23). Ethics have precedence </p>
<p>over rituals, and rituals are set in place not as an end to themselves but to </p>
<p>remind the community of a greater reality.</p>
<p>What is the implication of such a teaching? Mark draws out one, and </p>
<p>this is announced in a parenthesis at the end of v. 19: Jesus declares all foods </p>
<p>clean. is is a momentous remark, as what has been regarded as dierenti-</p>
<p>ating the elect people of God from the Gentiles was partly the food they ate. </p>
<p>If no food can make a person unclean, then laws governing pure and impure </p>
<p>food were no longer necessary. e boundary marker of food laws is then </p>
<p>taken down. For Mark’s audience this is of great consequence, for it means </p>
<p>Jews and Gentiles can come together to eat at the same table.</p>
