<p>Fusing the Horizons: Paltry Resources and a Needy World</p>
<p>Over the centuries, many readers have found in this episode the comforting </p>
<p>thought of the multiplying power of God. More than that, it has also become </p>
<p>an inspiration for many a Christian enterprise to be set up and kept running </p>
<p>against all odds.</p>
<p>The Church is often confronted with the sheer scale of human need. </p>
<p>When she looks at the physical resources that are available, the hiatus is so </p>
<p>wide that none without faith will dare take up the call to answer this need. </p>
<p>However, this episode instructs us that our paltry resources may be offered </p>
<p>up to God to be blessed and multiplied for the beneﬁt of the world. Mother </p>
<p>Teresa’s ministry is a ﬁne example of this dynamic. A lone nun, without </p>
<p>much, answered the need to minister to the poor and dying in Calcutta, </p>
<p>which resulted in much attention and effort being given to such lost causes.</p>
<p>Lest it be missed, Mark also teaches through this episode that God </p>
<p>does not “feed” his people out of a sheer miracle. Instead, he uses resourc-</p>
<p>es already present, paltry as they may be, and meets their needs through his </p>
<p>servants, sometimes in spectacular ways and other times more mundane.</p>
<p>There is much that the Church can and must do. With God’s multiply-</p>
<p>ing power available, she should then be daring and venturing, not daunted </p>
<p>by seemingly impossibilities. The entire world is our scope, but we can start </p>
<p>with our immediate neighbors and neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Jesus Walks on Water (6:45–52)</p>
<p>is miracle story shares similar details with the earlier miracle of calming </p>
<p>the storm in 4:35–41. In both accounts a late crossing of the lake takes place, </p>
<p>strong winds blow, the disciples are terried and bewildered at the end of </p>
<p>the experience, and Jesus calms storms. However, the dierences are telling: </p>
Jesus now walks on water and utters words suggestive of divine disclosure.
<p>In this respect, the identity of Jesus receives further development.</p>
<p>ere is an interesting problem with respect to the locality. Luke tells </p>
<p>us the feeding of the 5,000 takes place at Bethsaida (Luke 9:10). is has </p>
<p>been identied as Bethsaida Julius on the northeastern shore of the lake. But </p>
