<p>Redening the Unclean 93</p>
<p>that the h commandment entails the concrete practise of providing for </p>
<p>parents. However, the “Corban” principle may be invoked to redirect God-</p>
<p>given resources from their proper and compassionate use for selsh ends, in </p>
<p>the name of devoting such resources to God! is makes a mockery of God </p>
<p>since it was he who gave the h commandment in the rst place. e will </p>
<p>of God is thus put in a secondary place.</p>
<p>Excursus on “Corban”</p>
<p>The Hebrew or Aramaic word means literally “gift,” but in the context of </p>
<p>the Jewish sacriﬁcial system, it refers to an offering made to God. So the </p>
<p>term may, by deﬁnition, refer to anything that has been devoted exclusively </p>
<p>to God, which means no one else may lay claim to it. In actual practice, </p>
<p>however, there was some latitude on how the principle was applied.</p>
<p>A piece of inscription taken from an ossuary discovered near Jerusalem </p>
<p>has the words, “Everything that a person will ﬁnd to his proﬁt in this os-</p>
<p>suary is an offering (qo¯ rban) to God from the one within it.”</p>
<p>166</p>
<p>What is so</p>
<p>interesting is that Jewish ossuaries are boxes constructed for the storage </p>
<p>of an ancestor’s bones. But the dedication of bones to God as an offering </p>
<p>or gift is unthinkable, given that they are considered ritually unclean. This </p>
<p>implies that the word qo¯rban is not really used to indicate an offering to </p>
<p>God, but to prevent any use of it. The word may then refer to a ban, rather </p>
<p>than an offering.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is evidence from the rabbinic discussions on vows </p>
<p>that what is rendered qo¯rban may still be used by the owner in some ways </p>
<p>(m. Ned. 5.6). So the provisions of Torah (precisely that which speaks of </p>
<p>not breaking vows and dedicating things to God) are twisted, and loopholes </p>
<p>are searched and exploited for the sake of one’s beneﬁt. In this light, it is </p>
<p>perfectly understandable why Jesus’ teaching puts emphasis on the heart.</p>
<p>e Conclusions Promulgated (7:14–23)</p>
<p>is sequel tackles an unexpressed question. Wouldn’t God be pleased with </p>
<p>the zeal to make all Israel follow the regulations prescribed for their priests? </p>
