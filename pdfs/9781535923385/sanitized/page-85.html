<p>Healing the Gerasene Demoniac 67</p>
<p>It alludes to the Roman Empire’s legions, by which the Empire has annexed </p>
<p>many territories to itself (i.e., possessing them), jealously guarding what has </p>
<p>been unjustly arrogated, and causing terror in its wake.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>is proposal has</p>
<p>mileage but it would be wrong to think of the episode as simply an alle-</p>
<p>gory of Roman occupation and oppression. Ancient people had no trouble </p>
<p>believing in the power of evil spirits. What the legion of demons did to </p>
<p>the man was similar to what the Empire did to the territory. Mark sees the </p>
<p>parallels and relates the story in a context where such parallels will be easily </p>
<p>perceived. It should also be noted that the passage does not issue a call to </p>
<p>Christians to take arms and rebel against the Roman Empire. Instead, the </p>
<p>way out of the terror of Roman occupation is to go on “exorcising” (i.e., </p>
<p>speaking the authoritative word of Jesus). is will overcome evil powers </p>
<p>and re-humanize the oppressed.</p>
<p>We can also understand the pedagogical point behind the recounting </p>
<p>of the reference to pigs as containers (vv. 11–13): unclean spirits should </p>
<p>dwell in unclean vessels, and not humans. at said, the demons’ request </p>
<p>does appear to be somewhat illogical, since the pigs proceeded to destroy </p>
<p>themselves aer being demonized. Perhaps Mark is suggesting that evil en-</p>
<p>tities ultimately destroy themselves.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>Most herds of pigs are small. A size of three hundred is already consid-</p>
<p>erable.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p> Not surprisingly, the villagers reacted negatively to their destruc-</p>
<p>tion (vv. 14–17). To those who have eyes only for economics, two thousand </p>
<p>pigs are worth more than one formerly insane man. Accordingly, the people </p>
<p>of that town beg Jesus to depart from them. It is much cheaper to consign a </p>
<p>person to an ancient mental institution (the tombs) or to buy chains. All this </p>
<p>means Jesus is not welcomed—not because they do not believe in his power, </p>
<p>but because they do not accept his program.</p>
<p>Jesus’ response to the man’s request to follow him is fascinating (vv. </p>
<p>18–19). is is the rst time the Markan audience hears of Jesus’ not allow-</p>
<p>ing someone to follow him, but there may be strategic reasons for this. Jesus </p>
<p>may be refused entry to this community to minister, but he can plant his </p>
<p>witness. e former demoniac would be a strategic witness, having himself </p>
<p>personally experienced the healing ministry of Jesus. Interestingly, it is also </p>
<p>the rst time in Mark’s Gospel that Jesus expressly commands a person to </p>
<p>publish abroad what has happened to him! is is probably to be explained </p>
<p>by the need for a witness in Gentile territory, and also that Gentiles are not </p>
