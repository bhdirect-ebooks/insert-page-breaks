<p>Conict with Religious Authorities 31</p>
<p>If the latter, the testimony is meant to indict them.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> e two other occur-</p>
<p>rences of such a phrase in Mark are found in 6:11 and 13:9, and they are </p>
<p>all used in contexts of opposition. is prompts us to treat the dative here </p>
<p>as a dative of disadvantage. So the healing of the leper becomes damning </p>
<p>evidence either for the priests’ unbelief in Jesus’ ministry (but Mark has not </p>
<p>said anything about this yet) or the failure (whoever these people are) to </p>
<p>eect true purity in Israel.</p>
<p>Why is there a need for silence in v. 44? e next verse gives the eect </p>
<p>of the leper’s failure to keep Jesus’ injunction, and this may be regarded as a </p>
<p>partial explanation of Jesus’ charge: the resultant publicity prevented Jesus </p>
<p>from entering villages openly. However, it has also been suggested that Jesus </p>
<p>does not want to be misconstrued as challenging the Temple authorities, </p>
<p>since it is their function to make ritual purity possible.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>But such a proposal</p>
<p>is problematic, because the priest does not play the role of a miracle worker </p>
<p>but a certier. Accordingly, Jesus’ healing would not have been perceived as </p>
<p>challenging the priest’s authority. It may be better to look at the immediate </p>
<p>Markan context, and at the larger interest Mark has in Jesus’ commands to </p>
<p>silence (i.e., the secrecy motif).</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>As the Markan narrative unfolds, it will</p>
<p>be seen that this motif has an important theological function. e meaning </p>
<p>of Jesus’ identity and ministry (incorporating here the spectacular healings </p>
<p>and miracles) can only be grasped fully in the light of the cross.</p>
<p>Conflict with Religious Authorities (2:1—3:6)</p>
<p>Up to this stage, Mark has shown the reader the critical signicance of Jesus’ </p>
<p>ministry. He has also narrated the increasing popularity of Jesus. However, </p>
<p>Jesus does not have the requisite social credentials. is sets the stage for </p>
<p>conict. Mark 2:1—3:6 brings together ve controversy stories to paint with </p>
<p>a broad brush the key issues between Jesus and the religious leaders. ese </p>
<p>stories also foreshadow the nal conict in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Mark uses structural devices, so as to help his audience better to ap-</p>
<p>preciate and remember the critical points. An inuential proposal suggests </p>
<p>that a concentric (chiastic) structure may be found. In this scheme, the rst </p>
<p>story corresponds with the last, or h in this case, the second with the </p>
<p>fourth, and the third stands as the center piece (see Diagram 1).</p>
