<p>e Eschatological Discourse ontheMountofOlives 185</p>
<p>sage should not refer to the preachers of the gospel.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>To be noted further</p>
<p>is that all the other occurrences of angelos in Mark—and there are not many </p>
<p>(1:13; 8:38; 12:25; 13:32)—refer to heavenly agents.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>e gathering of the elect from the four winds connotes also the no-</p>
<p>tion of the re-gathering of Israel’s exiles (Zech 2:6). is means the salvation </p>
<p>of the elect, and is most suitable as language of the denouement. In the pre-</p>
<p>vious section the elect were described as being beleaguered. In this section, </p>
<p>what answers to that beleaguered condition must be the denouement.</p>
<p>Aer a long trek through the previous dicult paragraphs, we need to </p>
recapitulate the key message given thus far: there will be no divine deliver-
<p>ance for the Temple. e Son of Man comes aer its destruction and not </p>
before. ere is indeed divine rescue, but it is not for the Temple. Instead,
<p>it is for God’s elect, dened by their links with the Son of Man. is being </p>
<p>the case, loyalty to the Temple is seen as wrong-headed. Furthermore, Jesus’ </p>
<p>disciples must not be caught in the vortex of extreme eschatological specu-</p>
<p>lations which oen lead to violent revolutions. Instead, they are to continue </p>
<p>preaching the gospel of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Lesson from the Fig Tree (13:28–31)</p>
<p>Just as the discourse in the earlier paragraphs presupposes a two-phase </p>
<p>drama (the destruction of the Temple and the coming of the Son of Man), </p>
<p>the answer on the question of time also splits into two parts (vv. 28–31 and </p>
<p>vv. 32–37). e rst concerns the time for the Temple’s destruction and the </p>
<p>second, the Parousia.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>e g tree is to be understood in its normal sense and not as a symbol </p>
<p>for Israel, even though it was used as such in chapter 11.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>Since there are</p>
<p>many g trees in Palestine, it can be used as a good illustration (the Greek </p>
<p>is actually “a parable.”) e lesson is that there is a short time between its </p>
<p>budding and the arrival of summer. Similarly, there will be a short time </p>
<p>between the sign (v. 14), and the destruction of the Temple. To make the </p>
<p>107. France 2002: 536 is aware of the potency of this argument, but he insists that </p>
<p>these angels are given the missionary task. is appears dubious as the discourse spe-</p>
<p>cically links the missionary task with the work of the disciples (vv. 10–11). It appears </p>
<p>inescapable that verse 27 speaks not of a worldwide mission but a worldwide gathering </p>
<p>for the coming of the Son of Man (which is also the language of the parallel in Matt </p>
<p>24:30–31).</p>
<p>108. High Christology is contained here, for in the OT only God may send his an-</p>
<p>gels to perform tasks. See Evans 2001: 329.</p>
<p>109. Cf. also Stein 2008: 610, 617.</p>
<p>110. See our treatment of the relevant passage.</p>
