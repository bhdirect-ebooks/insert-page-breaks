<p>oen meant to be identied and reconciled with him. Hence, Jesus’ eating </p>
<p>with the wrong company suggests he has no reservation about being identi-</p>
<p>ed with such people, and may convey the scandalous message that God </p>
<p>accepts them.</p>
<p>Excursus: The Pharisees</p>
<p>The general consensus is that Pharisees were certainly not people who </p>
<p>were simply “keeping up appearances.” The term probably comes from </p>
<p>the Hebrew pa¯rûš, which means “separated one,” and was probably ﬁrst </p>
<p>coined by their opponents. According to Josephus, the Pharisees were one </p>
<p>of four major sects (the others being the Sadducees, the Essenes, and what </p>
<p>Josephus calls “the Fourth Philosophy,” who were probably the Zealots; </p>
<p>see Josephus War 2:162–66 and Antiquities 13:171–73; 18:11–25). They </p>
<p>were accorded the high honor of being accurate interpreters of Torah. Their </p>
<p>origins remain shrouded in mystery but they were active in the two centu-</p>
<p>ries straddling the beginning of the Common Era. Comprising mainly lay </p>
<p>members, they nevertheless exercised powerful pressure on Jewish religion </p>
<p>and policy. Their aim was to purify Israel through an intensiﬁed observance </p>
<p>of Torah, inspired by the tradition of the elders, so the nation would be </p>
<p>prepared for God’s promised return. So they set up what might be termed as </p>
<p>“eating fellowships” so as to eat food in a state of purity, beﬁtting that of the </p>
<p>Temple. This concern for purity was not regarded simply as an inward form </p>
<p>of piety, since the Pharisees were also linked with revolts (notably Saddok </p>
<p>in the revolt of AD 6; see Josephus Antiquities 18:4). Purity could also be </p>
<p>a political issue.</p>

<p>Jesus identies his mission in a proverb-like statement</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>: to restore sinners. </p>
<p>It also implies that oering help to those who do not need it is futile. Under-</p>
<p>stood this way, the term “righteous” is in the statement primarily as a kind </p>

<p>42. ere were statements in the ancient world that were similar in eect (e.g., “it </p>
<p>is not the custom of doctors to spend their time with the healthy, but where people are </p>
<p>ill,” Plutarch Apophthegm Laconica 230F). See other examples in Collins 2007: 195–96.</p>
