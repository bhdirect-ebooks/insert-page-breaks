<p>e Messiah Must Suer: e First Passion Prediction 117</p>
<p>Some scholars think it must mean the Parousia (i.e., the conclusion of </p>
<p>human history).</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>ey will then take it that Jesus has made a mistake. Since</p>
<p>that prediction, two thousand years of history has transpired, and those </p>
<p>who heard these words have all tasted death. A popular notion among some </p>
<p>conservative Christians runs in a similar vein, but regards Jesus as referring </p>
<p>to the Jewish race instead. Jesus is then saying the Jewish race will not be </p>
<p>obliterated at all; it will, instead, experience the Second Coming of Christ. </p>
<p>If this were correct, Jesus would have a strange way of putting things. is </p>
<p>makes us wonder whether we also got it right with his other sayings.</p>
<p>We must pay close attention to the Markan hints. In Mark, the kingdom </p>
<p>of God has indeed come through Jesus’ ministry. So Jesus is not speaking </p>
<p>about the coming of the kingdom per se but its coming in power: a visible </p>
<p>and clear display of the hidden kingdom that has come. is means any </p>
<p>event that shows clearly God reigns and has vindicated Jesus.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>e Parousia</p>
<p>of Jesus qualies but it is not the only candidate. Secondly, the saying in the </p>
<p>Markan context is given as a supplement to v. 38. e implication then is </p>
<p>that the vindication of the Messiah will, indeed, be given at the eschaton, </p>
<p>but before that comes a foretaste of this may be given too. So Jesus expects </p>
<p>something that will fortify his disciples in their belief that they have not fol-</p>
<p>lowed a lunatic. Consequently, it must be an event that takes place in their </p>
<p>lifetime. So much is clear, but the diculty comes in trying to pin down the </p>
<p>exact event. Some scholars take the sequel to be the case—the transgura-</p>
<p>tion of Jesus demonstrates to the disciples that the one who is going to suer </p>
is indeed God’s Son, divinely chosen to rule as God’s vicegerent.
<p>15</p>
<p>Others</p>
will take this to be the resurrection of Jesus—a clear-cut divine vindication
<p>of Jesus in the eyes of the apostles and the early Church (cf. Rom 1:4)</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>—or </p>
<p>perhaps even the crucixion.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Still others think that it is the destruction of</p>
<p>Jerusalem, as that event vindicates Jesus’ prediction and hence his status and </p>
<p>his ministry.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>e problem here is that Mark, while he does give clues, does not give </p>
<p>enough of them to help us adjudicate amongst these competing views. Per-</p>
<p>haps there is no need for this, since the main message is not aected. Jesus </p>
