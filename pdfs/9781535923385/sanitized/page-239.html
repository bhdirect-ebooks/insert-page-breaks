<p>e Resurrection of Jesus 221</p>
<p>The Resurrection of Jesus (16:1–8)</p>
<p>Because of who Jesus is and what he has predicted, the story of Mark cannot </p>
<p>simply end with Jesus’ Passion. Many other themes point in that direction: </p>
<p>the messianic secret which could only be fully revealed when the resur-</p>
<p>rection takes place; the promise of renewal for the distraught, discouraged, </p>
<p>and disappearing disciples; and the vindication of Jesus’ claims, made in </p>
<p>the face of much skepticism and opposition. is is what an ancient reader </p>
<p>would have expected of Mark’s conclusion. However, as the Markan text </p>
<p>now stands, there is a problem.</p>
<p>e Problem of Mark’s Ending</p>
<p>e rst thing to note in this connection is that it is almost the unanimous </p>
<p>opinion of all textual critics that Mark 16:9–20 is not an original part of </p>
<p>Mark’s text.</p>
<p>213</p>
<p>e earliest Greek manuscripts do not have them (ﬡ and B,</p>
<p>fourth cent.) nor do some early versions. Prominent Church Fathers either </p>
<p>do not know them (e.g., Clement and Origen) or testify to the fact that they </p>
<p>are not found in the majority of manuscripts available to them (e.g., Eu-</p>
<p>sebius and Jerome). Furthermore, even if the majority of the manuscripts </p>
<p>emanating from the later period of Church history do have these verses as </p>
<p>the ending, other manuscripts from roughly the same period (083, sixth to </p>
<p>seventh cent.) have a shorter ending,</p>
<p>214</p>
<p> and some even conate the end-</p>
<p>ings (L Ψ 099, earliest seventh cent.), or attest to unique materials (W, h </p>
<p>cent.).</p>
<p>215</p>
<p>Indeed, of the manuscripts which attest to the Longer Ending</p>
<p>(vv. 9–20), some of them (f1.22) mark this o with signs or comments to </p>
<p>indicate its doubtful status. e above phenomenon is best explained by </p>
<p>positing that the original text as we have it now ends at v. 8. is explains </p>
<p>why a multiplicity of endings arose. Moreover, the last twelve verses read </p>
<p>like a pastiche of traditions deriving from Luke, John and Acts.</p>
<p>216</p>
<p> Further-</p>
<p>more, there is a high concentration of unique words found in these verses </p>
<p>(i.e., vocabulary not found elsewhere in Mark).</p>

<p>214. e translation of Marcus 2009: 1089 is: “And all the things that they had been </p>
<p>commanded they promptly announced to those around Peter. And aer these things </p>
<p>Jesus himself also sent out through them, from east to west, the sacred and imperishable </p>
<p>announcement of eternal salvation.”</p>
