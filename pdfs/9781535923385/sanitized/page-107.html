<p>Redening the Unclean 89</p>
<p>43:1, 5 etc.). We should also note that the expression ’anî hû’ occurs in the </p>
<p>Isaianic passages that speak of God’s promise of deliverance through the </p>
<p>waters of a second Exodus (Isa 43:1–25; 51:10–12). is motif is certainly </p>
<p>relevant to Mark’s Gospel, which utilizes signicantly the second Exodus </p>
<p>concept. To be noted nally is that the expression is also related to the </p>
<p>covenantal name of Yahweh. All this means that Jesus’ use of these words, </p>
<p>especially in the context of his walking on water, is theologically charged.</p>
<p>160</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mark’s message to his readers is now clear. He wants them to under-</p>
<p>stand that as they struggle in “tumultuous waters” in obedience to Jesus’ </p>
<p>commands, they are to remember that he who commands is also he who, </p>
<p>like God, walks on water and is present with them.</p>
<p>e security that comes with Jesus’ presence is emphasized in vv. 51–</p>
<p>52. e calming eect is immediate, and the disciples were greatly amazed </p>
<p>(indicated by the Greek en heautois). Mark attributes their fear—or lack of </p>
<p>faith—to the disciples’ failure to understand the meaning of the feeding </p>
<p>of the 5,000. is, in turn, is brought about by their hardness of heart, a </p>
<p>condition dangerously close to that of the Pharisees (3:5). e reason given </p>
<p>is rather mystifying, as Mark has not explicitly said what it is about the </p>
<p>feeding story that should have strengthened the disciples’ faith. Perhaps we </p>
<p>may surmise that the disciples have forgotten Jesus is the compassionate </p>
<p>eschatological shepherd, upon whom the disciples can rely for timely help.</p>
<p>Further Healings (6:53–56)</p>
<p>Apparently frustrated by the high wind, they end up in Gennesaret instead </p>
<p>of Bethsaida. e name Gennesaret refers not to a town, but to a strip of </p>
<p>land between Tiberias and Capernaum,</p>
<p>161</p>
<p>on the western shore of the Sea</p>
<p>of Galilee. Once Jesus steps on to shore, the crowds recognize him and start </p>
<p>to ock to him, bringing with them the sick. Connecting with the idea from </p>
<p>the story of the healing of the woman with chronic bleeding (5:27–30), </p>
<p>Mark tells his audience that many beg Jesus to allow them to touch the edge </p>
<p>of his cloak. So the stories of nature miracles end with the note that Jesus’ </p>
<p>popularity continues to grow.</p>
<p>Redefining the Unclean (7:1–23)</p>
<p>In the course of narrating some miracles, Mark has presented Jesus as </p>
<p>relativizing Jewish purity regulations (e.g., 1:40–45; 5:1–20). In fact, in the </p>
<p>160. For a ne study on the use of this phrase, see Williams 2000.</p>
