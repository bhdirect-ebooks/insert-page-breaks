<p>Jesus’ Crucixion and Death 215</p>
<p>God be forsaken by God?” or “If Jesus is forsaken by God, does it mean he </p>
<p>had died spiritually, and thus God has suered hell?” As important as such </p>
<p>questions may be, they actually take us away from the original intention of </p>
<p>Mark.</p>
<p>e words are derived from the rst verse of Psalm 22. We have point-</p>
<p>ed out earlier that this Psalm has had a great inuence on the composition </p>
<p>of the Passion Narrative, and should therefore be used as a template for </p>
<p>interpretation.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p>In its original context, the Psalm features the complaint of</p>
<p>the righteous person, who, because of the treatment he has received from </p>
<p>friends and foes, feels he is as good as forsaken by God. However, it ends on </p>
<p>a note of hope that God would hear him and come to his aid. e complaint </p>
<p>may then be regarded as being made in faith and hope. Using this as a cue, </p>
<p>what we may legitimately claim is that at this moment Jesus is the suering </p>
<p>righteous one par excellence. Just as the Son of Man sums up Israel’s history </p>
<p>in himself, so does the suering Jesus sum up the unjust suering of the </p>
<p>righteous. Since Jesus is steeped in Scripture, we may expect him to think of </p>
<p>the vindication that comes aer all this suering, which is indicated in the </p>
<p>Psalm. Hence we may conclude that as painful as the complaint may be, it </p>
<p>is voiced in the hope of restoration and vindication,</p>
<p>199</p>
<p>without belittling the</p>
<p>suering Jesus experiences.</p>
<p>e use of the verb boaō (“cry out”) here reinforces the above observa-</p>
<p>tions. First of all, Jesus does not die like other crucied victims in that he </p>
<p>cries out loudly before death comes. Crucixion kills by exhaustion and </p>
<p>asphyxiation, and most victims die with a whimper (Seneca Epistula 101).</p>
<p>200</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this regard there is a rather distinctive quality to his death. Secondly, the </p>
<p>fact that the word is used only twice in Mark invites us to think of their rela-</p>
<p>tion. e cry in 1:3 sounds out the way of the Lord at the beginning of the </p>
<p>gospel. e derelict cry concludes this way. In this regard, the cry signies </p>
<p>not a loss of hope because it is related to God’s way. is means as agonizing </p>
as the experience may be, there is an implicit trust in divine vindication. All
<p>this has great mileage for Mark’s audience, as their being persecuted would </p>
<p>raise all sorts of questions about God’s administration of justice.</p>

<p>so as not to lessen the shock eect of the cry.</p>

<p>tention based on reading the cry of dereliction from the perspective of a recongured </p>
<p>Akedah.</p>
