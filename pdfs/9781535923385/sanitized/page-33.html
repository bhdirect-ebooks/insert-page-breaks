mean he/she was divine, but the chosen ruler or king of Israel. e Qumran
<p>scrolls (4QFlor and 4Q246) oer clear evidence that this is so. Of course, </p>
<p>the Christian Church could have poured new content into the title, based </p>
<p>on their understanding of who Jesus was. at is, as Son of God he was </p>
<p>not simply king but more than king. However, Mark has intentionally le </p>
<p>the meaning unexplained in the prologue. He will clarify this as his narra-</p>
<p>tive proceeds. Modern scholarship has oen regarded this title as the key to </p>
<p>Mark’s Christology.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>It remains for us to summarize what Mark has achieved with his head-</p>
<p>ing. Mark has certainly introduced the key character, identied him with </p>
<p>title(s) and indicated his importance with the correlate phrase “beginning </p>
<p>of the gospel”. All this is indeed explosive because set in the rst century </p>
<p>Roman Empire, the terms such as “gospel” and “son of God” formed a sig-</p>
<p>nicant part of the unifying propaganda of an Empire that comprised many </p>
<p>subjugated kingdoms and peoples. ese terms laud the ruling power, usu-</p>
<p>ally making reference to the one who was touted as the greatest among them </p>
<p>all: Augustus Caesar. But Mark speaks of a dierent gospel and a dierent </p>
<p>Son of God, who is none other than Jesus of Nazareth, hailing from what </p>
<p>may be regarded as the backwater of the Empire, and belonging to a people </p>
<p>oen regarded as strange at best, or a pest at worst. In other words, right </p>
<p>from the very start, the alert reader would perceive that a contrast—indeed, </p>
<p>a contest—is being set up between Augustus Caesar and Jesus Christ, be-</p>
<p>tween Rome and the Christian Church.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons</p>
<p>Mark’s prologue was a shrill challenge to his society. What is striking in </p>
<p>this challenge is the use of signiﬁcant terms to ﬂesh out the meaning of </p>
<p>the Christian gospel. In other words, the potent content is given relevant </p>
<p>packaging so that its power can be perceived much more quickly. Indeed, </p>
<p>the packaging also hints at the contrast between the Roman gospels and </p>
<p>the Christian gospel. One was plural, needing frequent re-enactments and </p>
<p>connected with the might of this world; the other is singular, being the one </p>
<p>true gospel, and is connected with the might of heaven but displayed, as </p>
<p>Mark will show, in the cruciﬁed form of the Messiah. Popular and signiﬁcant </p>
<p>terms are thus being subverted by the Christian message.</p>
