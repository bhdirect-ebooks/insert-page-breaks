<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>7:1–2390</p>
<p>case of the healing of a woman with a menstrual problem (5:25–34), the </p>
<p>theological message given was that purity should not recoil in the face of </p>
<p>impurity, but should reach out to restore and heal. Such a revolutionary </p>
<p>view of holiness would certainly have led to great controversies in rst cen-</p>
<p>tury Palestine. In recent memory, famous Jewish martyrs of the Maccabean </p>
<p>period lost their lives precisely because of their uninching loyalty to the </p>
<p>purity code, especially the regulation banning consumption of pork. It was </p>
<p>believed that such loyalty would induce God to come alongside the nation. </p>
<p>Small Israel could then triumph over any big kingdom. Hence, purity is-</p>
<p>sues were not simply about hygiene. Bound up with them were the triad of </p>
<p>Torah, tradition, and politics, and as such they were loyalty indicators. What </p>
<p>served as loyalty indicators could easily become boundary markers. Indeed, </p>
<p>food was especially eective as a boundary marker, because eating together </p>
<p>in ancient societies served also the function of social integration.</p>
<p>e Controversy Presented (7:1–13)</p>
<p>To indicate how high the stakes are, Mark informs his audience that a dele-</p>
<p>gation of scribes from Jerusalem is sent to hear Jesus on this matter, together </p>
<p>with local Pharisees (v. 1). e other instance where a delegation of religious </p>
<p>leaders came from Jerusalem to observe Jesus is found in 3:22, where the </p>
<p>important issue of the power behind Jesus’ exorcism was discussed. e </p>
<p>present controversy is sparked when Jesus’ disciples were seen to be eating </p>
<p>food with unwashed hands. is is not because of negligent hygiene. Rather, </p>
<p>it ignores the provisions of the purity code, as interpreted by the Pharisees </p>
<p>and their sympathetic scribes.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mark’s parenthetical remarks in vv. 3–4 indicate that he expects most </p>
<p>members of his audience to be Gentiles. e phrase “all the Jews” have </p>
<p>caused some diculty. From the extant evidence, we may gather that while </p>
<p>the Pharisees did have a special concern for ritual purity,</p>
<p>163</p>
<p>it is not strictly</p>
<p>accurate to attribute such a concern to all Jews. However, the Pharisees did </p>
<p>have a great inuence over ordinary Jews.</p>
<p>164</p>
<p> eir inuence might be re-</p>
<p>garded as signicant enough for Mark to present this practice as a broadly </p>
<p>Jewish phenomenon to his Gentile audience.</p>
<p>Mark uses an unusual word to describe the washing of hands in v. 3: </p>
<p>the Greek pygmē. It literally means “st,” and this is where the trouble starts. </p>

<p>163. Neusner 1973: 80; but objections were raised by Sanders 1992: 428–43. e </p>
<p>overall case of Neusner remains cogent.</p>
