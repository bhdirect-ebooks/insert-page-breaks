<p>millstone” here is actually that which is driven by a donkey (the Greek mylos </p>
<p>onikos is literal, which means “donkey-millstone”). is is much larger than </p>
<p>the common millstone. e picture is therefore exaggerated and grotesque, </p>
<p>given in the interest of making the saying memorable. Such a grotesquely-</p>
<p>pictured fate is better than the apparently innocuous tripping up of people </p>
<p>with nascent faith.</p>
<p>Why should such a ghastly ending be described as a better option? e </p>
<p>answer is given in the next three sayings, each featuring a part of the body </p>
<p>as the instrument of stumbling (vv. 43, 45, 47). Together they speak of the </p>
<p>basic activities of a human being: seeing, doing and walking. is is a poeti-</p>
<p>cally comprehensive way of referring to the major sources or instruments </p>
<p>of sin and stumbling (cf. Prov 6:16–19; Job 31:1, 5, 7). e thrust of these </p>
<p>three sayings is that it is better to lose many basic human functions than </p>
<p>to be thrown into Gehenna. e word in Greek actually refers to the rub-</p>
<p>bish dump of the Valley of Hinnom, situated just outside Jerusalem, where </p>
<p>res burn continuously. In Jewish apocalyptic literature, this becomes a </p>
<p>metaphor for the ultimate place of punishment (1 En 27:1–2; 54:1; 56:3–4; </p>
<p>90:26; 4 Ezra 7:36; 2 Bar 59:10; 85:13). Whether the metaphor speaks of </p>
<p>annihilation</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> or of conscious punishment lasting all eternity,</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>the word</p>
<p>itself does not say. However, this rubbish dump is described later in v. 48 as </p>
<p>the place “where their worm does not die, and their re is not quenched.” </p>
<p>e words are taken from Isa 66:24, and there it speaks of the dead bodies </p>
<p>of God’s enemies, le decomposing and smoldering in the battleeld. Such a </p>
<p>combination of images is also found in later Jewish literature (Judith 16:17; </p>
<p>Sir 7:17). So what is described as enduring are the agents of destruction and </p>
<p>decay. e opposite of being cast into this eternal rubbish dump is entering </p>
<p>the kingdom of God (v. 47).</p>
<p>e object of stumbling in v. 42 is the little one who believes, but in </p>
<p>vv. 43–48 it is the person himself. Has the connection been lost? No, the </p>
<p>catch-word skandalizomai is maintained, and Mark may then be construed </p>
<p>as using it as a stepping stone to another idea: the disciples must watch </p>
<p>themselves lest they also stumble. More important, the one who causes oth-</p>
<p>ers to stumble also stumbles himself, or the one who makes discipleship to </p>
<p>be almost an impossible option for others makes himself a non-disciple.</p>
<p>e mention of the re that is not quenched in v. 48 leads to the enig-</p>
<p>matic sayings of vv. 49–50. In deciphering them, the rst thing to observe </p>
<p>is that the nal statement (v. 50) speaks about being at peace with one an-</p>
<p>other. is dovetails with what we have been expounding. is collection of </p>
