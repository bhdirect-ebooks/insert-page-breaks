<p>e Gospel in Galilee</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>4:1–3460</p>
<p>ever, the absolute use of it is oen found in the NT. is gives it a technical </p>
<p>sense—the word of the gospel, which is also the eschatological word.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>We</p>
<p>may compare this with the OT depiction of God’s word: that which creates, </p>
<p>reveals, judges, restores, and recreates (Ps 19; 33:6; 119:105; Isa 55:10–11). </p>
<p>e gospel has similar functions.</p>
<p>Only through recognizing the momentous importance of the “word” </p>
<p>could the dierent responses symbolized by dierent soils become signi-</p>
<p>cant and not just run-of-the-mill comments about life. e eschatological </p>
<p>“word” is sown in dierent kinds of soils, indicating dierent conditions </p>
<p>of the heart. e dierent points along the spectrum of responses are </p>
<p>highlighted: those who lost it straightaway, through to those who gave up </p>
<p>because of persecution, and those who were hampered by the cares of this </p>
<p>age, and nally to those who respond positively. As interesting as these re-</p>
<p>sponses may be for a psychological enquiry or homiletical application, the </p>
<p>main point lies elsewhere. It is that the promised restorative word is given </p>
<p>while obduracy still works. is is because the full measure of obduracy </p>
<p>has yet to come, although it is now in process in Jesus’ ministry. is being </p>
<p>the case, the word given through Jesus’ ministry could be easily rejected by </p>
<p>the unbelieving as an impotent word and thus not God’s restorative word. </p>
<p>But the point of Jesus is that the word is now sown, and what is regarded as </p>
<p>impotent is actually potent, albeit hidden! e time that the Jews longed for </p>
<p>ardently has indeed come, although it is not accompanied by an open blaze </p>
<p>of glory. So faith is needed and the hearers are exhorted to listen carefully. </p>
<p>e parable then speaks of the paradoxical timing of the kingdom and the </p>
<p>paradoxical nature of its revelation. is manner of reading it ties up vv. </p>
<p>10–12 neatly with the parable interpretation, and dovetails with the thrust </p>
<p>of the next paragraph.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>Hidden in Order to Reveal (4:21–25)</p>
<p>e paragraph comprising vv. 21–25 picks up the theme of revelation versus </p>
<p>concealment, sounded in vv. 10–12. It speaks of the lamp’s coming to il-</p>
<p>luminate (see below) by being set on a lampstand, and not by being hidden </p>
<p>under a bowl or a bed. is is then concluded with a clear statement that all </p>
<p>things will ultimately be made clear, and the hidden open (v. 22). Aer that, </p>
<p>the exhortation to hear, rst sounded in v. 9 when the parable was told, is </p>
<p>given (v. 23), indicating the utter importance of that statement. All this is </p>
<p>further reinforced by the exhortation of v. 24: “to see what they are hearing.” </p>
