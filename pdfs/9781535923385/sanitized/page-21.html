<p>Introduction 3</p>
<p>beginning of the second century, Mark was connected with the writing of a </p>
<p>compilation of Jesus’ teachings.</p>
<p>Irenaeus supports Papias’s testimony. Since Irenaeus is defending the </p>
<p>authenticity of the four canonical Gospels as we now have them, it is im-</p>
<p>portant that he had a strong case, as otherwise his opponents could have </p>
<p>easily destroyed it. He indicates clearly that Mark is the author of the Second </p>
<p>Gospel, and that Peter is his source.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>We do not have room to cite all the</p>
<p>relevant testimonies from other early Church Fathers. Suce it to say that </p>
<p>their testimonies are consistent with what has been presented.</p>
<p>Some scholars have dismissed the signicance of the consistency of </p>
<p>these testimonies by arguing that they were all dependent on Papias. So the </p>
<p>many and varied witnesses are reduced to only one. e onus of proof is </p>
<p>really on them, and they have not clinched their case. Moreover, it is more </p>
<p>reasonable to believe this united testimony as reliable than to think it has </p>
<p>been fabricated or confusingly mentioned by someone prominent, and </p>
<p>from henceforth became the stu of inuential tradition.</p>
<p>To draw the threads of our argument together: Papias testies that </p>
<p>Mark wrote the “oracles of the Lord.” Patristic testimonies and the super-</p>
<p>scriptions in their varied forms speak with one voice: Mark wrote the Sec-</p>
<p>ond Gospel. is Gospel was signicant enough to be linked to Peter, and </p>
<p>used by Matthew and Luke. at an important work is connected with an </p>
<p>insignicant name indicates authenticity.</p>
<p>e Evangelist Mark</p>
<p>Who exactly is this Mark? e early patristic testimony identies him as </p>
<p>someone closely associated with Peter. As no other descriptors of his iden-</p>
<p>tity is given, we may surmise that the brief datum was enough for early </p>
<p>Christians to decipher his identity. If this consideration is correct, we are </p>
<p>led to look for a Mark in the earliest accounts of the rise of the church. e </p>
<p>NT books are key here.</p>
<p>e Acts of the Apostles mentions a certain John Mark was once a </p>
<p>travelling companion of the apostle Paul, and le him later (Acts 12:12, 25; </p>
<p>13:5, 13; 15:37). is is probably the same person mentioned in the Pauline </p>
<p>tradition (Col 4:10; 2 Tim 4:11; Phlm 24). All this testimony, if it refers to </p>
<p>one person, puts Mark as someone associated with Paul. In 1 Peter 5:13, </p>
<p>however, a certain Mark is expressly referred to as “son” by the writer of the </p>
<p>letter. Early tradition does not cast any doubt that behind 1 Peter stands Pe-</p>
<p>ter the apostle. If all this evidence speaks of two or three well-known Marks, </p>
