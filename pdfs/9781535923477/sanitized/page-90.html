<p>Introduction to 2 Timothy76</p>
<p>outside the city near San Sebastiano. Arrested in AD 66, he spent about </p>
<p>nine months imprisoned.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> Although he no longer had the mild condi-</p>
<p>tions of his rst house arrest (Acts 28:16, 30; 2 Tim 1:17), yet his trial was </p>
<p>delayed, probably because he appealed to the emperor, again pleading his </p>
<p>Roman citizenship and previous acquittal.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Paul and Peter at the end were</p>
<p>imprisoned in the Mamertine Prison, one of the principal prisons of Rome, </p>
<p>below which was the dungeon of the Tullianum. Traditionally, Paul and Pe-</p>
<p>ter were both killed June 29, AD 67. Paul was executed on the Ostian Way </p>
<p>outside Rome. Both Paul and Peter were interred in a marble tomb in San </p>
<p>Sebastiano on the Appian Way for a year and seven months. Paul was then </p>
<p>moved by Lucina in AD 69 near the Ostian Way on the Via Valentiniana, </p>
<p>where his con remains to this day.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>No clear traditions recount exactly where in Rome Paul was being </p>
<p>held during the writing of this last letter. Probably, not under house arrest, </p>
<p>yet not at the Mamertine dungeon (where any writing would be impos-</p>
<p>sible), he may have been incarcerated in a military camp or palace in the </p>
<p>city, bound to a soldier, as had been Agrippa.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Paul was allowed to have</p>
<p>friends visit him.</p>
<p>Titus and 1 Timothy clearly mention the locale of the readers of his </p>
<p>letter—Crete (Titus 1:5) and Ephesus (1 Tim 1:3)—but 2 Timothy is not as </p>
<p>explicit. Most likely, Timothy is still in or has returned to Ephesus (c. one </p>
<p>to four years later than 1 Tim, AD 64–66), because Onesiphorus’ house-</p>
<p>hold, who had visited Paul in Rome, had rendered service in Ephesus (1:18) </p>
<p>and was present now with Timothy (4:19). Prisca and Aquila had been in </p>
<p>Ephesus (Acts 18:19, 24–26) and were also now with Timothy (2 Tim 4:19). </p>
<p>If Timothy was in Ephesus, being part of Asia, he would indeed “know” </p>
<p>that all in Asia had deserted Paul (1:15). Paul sent Tychicus to Ephesus to </p>
<p>replace Timothy so that Timothy could leave (4:12).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Second Timothy is the</p>
<p>last letter written by Paul in the canon.</p>

<p>6. Neither Paul, nor Timothy, appear to be in essalonica, Galatia, Dalmatia, Troas, </p>
<p>Corinth, or Miletus (Robertson 1931, 4: 9–13, 20). Zahn (1953, 2: 18–19) concludes </p>
<p>Timothy is in Asia Minor, but not Ephesus.</p>
