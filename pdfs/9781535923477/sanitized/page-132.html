<p>of godliness but denying its power (3:2–5).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>e rst two and the last</p>
<p>word of the series (philautos, philarguros, philēdonos) all begin with philos, </p>
<p>a friendship type of love. But, having such objects of love does not develop </p>
<p>friendship with God, faith and love in Christ Jesus (1:13), salvation, liv-</p>
<p>ing, reigning, and enduring with Christ Jesus (2:10–12), enduring with the </p>
<p>truth (2:18, 25), and escaping the devil’s trap (2:26). e rst love is love </p>
<p>of self. e second love is love of money (silver), a visible deity.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>e nal</p>
<p>love summarizes one aspect of all these negative qualities: pleasure is loved </p>
<p>more than God (philotheos; loving pleasure, 3:4).</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Timothy and the church</p>
<p>could never join Paul in suering for the gospel, if love of self, money, or </p>
<p>pleasure superseded their love for Christ Jesus. </p>
<p>e concrete negative qualities that follow relate to one or more of </p>
<p>these three bad friendships. ose who do not acknowledge or thank God </p>
<p>may end being boastful or having false pretensions.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>In reality, they may</p>
<p>love self or money more than God. Haughty (hyperēphanos) is a more inten-</p>
<p>sive synonym of “boastful” (alazōn; 3:2). To be haughty is to cause oneself </p>
<p>to be resplendent, brought forth into the light, to shine more than others, </p>
<p>having an undue sense of one’s importance bordering on insolence.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Many</p>
<p>of the qualities in the 2 Timothy 3:2–5 list may also be found in Romans </p>
<p>1:30–31 because, like haughtiness, they are a result of not acknowledging </p>
<p>God or being humble before God, but, being a friend of the world instead </p>
<p>of a friend of God.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> God opposes such haughty people.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Such boastful and</p>
<p>haughty attitudes may easily turn to blasphemy or slander, being demonic </p>
<p>qualities (3:2). Disrespectful language about God or about other human </p>
<p>beings was a continual problem at Ephesus and Crete. A result of the heresy </p>
<p>at Ephesus, it had been a problem for Paul himself.</p>

<p>qualities, the rst eighteen in staccato fashion. ey are each one Greek word, except for </p>
<p>“disobedient to parents” (3:2). Each word is three to ve syllables long. e rhythm ends </p>
<p>at 3:4b, thereby emphasizing the remaining 3:4b–5.</p>

<p>6. Rom 1:21, 30; LSJ, 59–60. Some in business who do not plan humbly, sensitive to </p>
<p>the Lord’s will, may also end up boastful (Jas 4:16).</p>
<p>7. BDAG, 1033; ayer, 641, 647–48. Wealthy people can become haughty (1 Tim </p>
<p>6:17).</p>
