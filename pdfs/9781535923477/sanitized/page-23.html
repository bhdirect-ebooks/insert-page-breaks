<p>Set Straight (1:5–16)</p>
<p>Paul connects the rst section (1:5–16) to the introduction (Because of </p>
<p>this, I le you in Crete, 1:5a). Because Paul was entrusted with the mes-</p>
<p>sage revealed in God’s own time—commanded by God (1:3), a message so </p>
<p>important it was promised by God even before the start of time, a message </p>
<p>which gives eternal life, by a God who does not lie (1:2)—therefore, identi-</p>
<p>fying godly elders to promote these truths is crucial. </p>
<p>Paul Le Titus in Crete (1:5–9)</p>
<p>When did Crete (1:5) receive Christian inuence? Titus and Paul traveled </p>
<p>together in Syria, Asia Minor, Macedonia, and Achaia, according to Acts, </p>
<p>Galatians, and 2 Corinthians. is letter is the only reference to both of </p>
<p>them having been in Crete. e New Testament has two references to Crete </p>
<p>outside of the Letter to Titus. One reference is to Pentecost (May-June) </p>
<p>when devout Jews from Crete were present in Jerusalem, hearing Jesus’ </p>
<p>disciples proclaim God’s wonder in the Cretan language (Acts 2:1–11). e </p>
<p>Cretans spoke a dialect of Greek.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>e second reference is in Acts 27. As</p>
<p>Paul, Aristarchus, and Luke set sail to Rome, they travel by Crete’s Cape </p>
<p>Salmone, arriving at Fair Havens near Lasea (Acts 27:7–8). Because sailing </p>
<p>was now dangerous (until Pentecost), the owner of the ship preferred to sail </p>
<p>to Phoenix in Crete to winter there (Acts 27:12). Instead, the storm winds </p>
<p>drove the ship as far as Malta (Acts 28:1), near Sicily. </p>
<p>Jews had been living in Crete for many years. In the second century </p>
<p>BC, Roman Consul Lucius sent King Ptolemy a letter expressing that Jews </p>
<p>were allies of the Romans. A copy of the letter was sent to Jews in Gortyn, </p>
<p>Crete (not too far from Fair Havens) (1 Macc 15:15–23).</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Cretans may have</p>
<p>been mentioned in the Old Testament as early as Genesis 10:14, descen-</p>
<p>dants of Ham, Noah’s son (“Caphtorites, from whom the Philistines were </p>
<p>descended”; also 1 Chr 1:12). Even though the Philistines were enemies </p>
<p>of the Jews (1 Sam 30:14), Kerethites were part of David’s loyal guards.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>e Philistines are described as the “remnant of the isle of Caphtor” (Jer </p>

<p>11. Josephus, whose wife was a Jew from Crete, Life 76 [427], mentions Cretan Jews </p>
<p>during the time of Herod: J.W. 2.7 [103]; Ant. 17.12 [327].</p>
