<p>Set Straight (1:5–16)</p>

<p>as circumcision, kosher food and drink, and festival observation (e.g., Col </p>
<p>2:16–23). In contrast, Jesus’ blood given in behalf of sin results in genuinely </p>
<p>puried or “cleaned” people, evidenced by their enthusiasm to do good </p>
<p>(Titus 2:14). e focus, then, is taken away from external to internal purity. </p>
<p>us, those who have been puried by Jesus’ atoning death now see all </p>
<p>through puried inner selves. As Jesus explained, “For it is from within, </p>
<p>from the human heart, that evil intentions come” (Mark 7:21–23; NRSV). </p>
<p>In the same way, as Jesus challenged the Pharisees and scribes who were </p>
<p>concerned for the ritual external purity of the drinking and eating utensils </p>
<p>while they remained internally greedy and self-indulgent (Matt 23:25–26), </p>
<p>Paul challenged the circumcision party who chastised ritual impurity in the </p>
<p>church while inwardly they were deled. ey denied God’s works by not </p>
<p>doing them. </p>
<p>ey are then described by three adjectives: bdelyktos (abominable), </p>
<p>apeithēs (disobedient), and adokimos (unacceptable) (1:16). Bdelyktos is </p>
<p>a strong word: “He that pronounces the unjust just, and the just unjust, is </p>
<p>unclean (akathartos) and abominable (bdelyktos) with God” (Prov 17:15 </p>
<p>LXX). Its noun form is used to describe the sacrilege at the temple in Jeru-</p>
<p>salem in 168 BC by worshipers of Zeus (1 Macc 1:54, 59). For those who are </p>
<p>concerned for the law, to be called an “abomination,” a term employed for </p>
<p>what is most abhorrent to God, would be shocking. But, they were people </p>
<p>who could not be persuaded, and thus were disobedient to God’s truth </p>
<p>(Acts 26:19). Apeithēs is the negation of peithos (“persuasive”). Paul will </p>
<p>later describe himself as formerly apeithēs (Titus 3:3). And, nally, they are </p>
<p>adokimos (“not approved” or “accepted”). As an athlete prepares to enter </p>
<p>and win a race, a Christian should prepare to do good actions that merit </p>
<p>God’s approval (1 Cor 9:24–27). But false teachings do not lead to good </p>
<p>actions. e false teachers are unacceptable, they have failed the test (2 </p>
<p>Cor 13:5)! </p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: The Place of Education </p>
<p>What is the value of education? Education prevents deception and clariﬁes </p>
<p>what we should believe and do. Orthodoxy affects orthopraxy. But, are ortho-</p>
<p>dox people like a cement block? Do they become ﬁxed, immovable, merciless, </p>
<p>without life? Or, are the orthodox like a healthy body, which can move easily, </p>
