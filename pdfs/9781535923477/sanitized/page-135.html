<p>Timothy Needs to Continue in Ministry despite Opposition (3:1—4:8) </p>
<p>121</p>
<p>fested by Christ Jesus who abolished death and gave life and immortality </p>
<p>(1:9–10).</p>
<p>Timothy, in contrast, must: keep turning yourself away from these</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3:5b). Apostrephō can be used as an exemplary or non-exemplary action. </p>
<p>In a non-exemplary manner, some people turned away from Paul (1:15) </p>
<p>and others turn away from truth (Titus 1:14), but, in an exemplary man-</p>
<p>ner, believers need to turn away from evil.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>Timothy must reject all the</p>
<p>behavior listed in 3:2–5. However, since the pronoun these (toutous) in 3:5 </p>
<p>is masculine plural, does this suggest Timothy must turn away from the </p>
<p>people (3:2) who exhibit such behavior? If so, how can he then dialogue </p>
<p>with his opponents with the intention to help them repent (2:24–25)? Or, </p>
<p>must Timothy turn away only from the behavior itself, as in 2:16, 23, not </p>
<p>the people per se?</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>Timothy certainly must reject these behaviors, and,</p>
<p>keeping away from people who do these behaviors is an aspect of turning </p>
<p>away from their behavior. As Paul tells the Corinthians: “bad company de-</p>
<p>stroys good morals” (1 Cor 15:33). Yet, he must also be open to teach those </p>
<p>who are teachable (2:24–26).</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>Women as Prisoners (3:6–9)</p>
<p>People (rather than behavior) is suggested by the next sentence, because </p>
<p>from the type of people listed in 3:2–5 comes this group: For out of these </p>
<p>(people) are the ones going into the households and taking prisoner </p>
<p>attractive women, overwhelmed with sins, being led by manifold pas-</p>
<p>sions, always learning and never being able to come into knowledge </p>
<p>of truth (3:6–7). Paul uses the present participle to suggest this action is </p>
<p>present and ongoing. ese people do two things: go into</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>households</p>
<p>and take prisoner women (3:6). ey themselves already have been taken </p>
<p>prisoner by the devil to do the devil’s will (captured alive in a trap; 2:26), </p>
<p>27 Thayer, 68; Matt 5:42.</p>
<p>28. Acts 3:26; Rom 11:26; 2 Tim 2:16, 23.</p>
<p>29. en the pronoun toutous would be translated as these things, being resumptive, </p>
<p>referring to all that precedes in a general way (Robertson 1934: 698).</p>
<p>30. Towner (2006: 561) thinks the 3:5 command refers to people who are completely </p>
<p>hardened in opposition, the core of the movement, that can no longer be reached, as in </p>
<p>1 Tim 1:20.</p>
<p>31. Endynō signies “to enter into an area through devious means or pretense, slip </p>
<p>in” (BDAG, 333).</p>
