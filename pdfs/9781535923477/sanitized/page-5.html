<p>Paul and His Coworkers at His Last Battle at Rome</p>
<p>by William David Spencer and Aída Besançon Spencer,</p>
<p>Every army is like a single soldier.</p>
<p>Some of its bodily parts are functioning well.</p>
<p>Some are malfunctioning and harming the rest of the body.</p>
<p>Some are assigned to maintenance to keep the body militant functioning.</p>
<p>And the post-commander, like the brain, is multi-tasking—</p>
<p>accomplishing several goals at once.</p>
<p>So was the army of Christ, as commanded by the Field Marshall Paul at Rome.</p>
<p>is campaign was Paul’s ﬁnal battle.</p>
<p>At his side was his medic Luke and the platoon at Rome: Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, </p>
<p>Claudia, and the brothers and sisters—courageous and valiant each.</p>
<p>As any army or anybody, Paul’s command had its problems and its strengths:</p>
<p>Demas, the deserter, the body’s wandering eye, following aer another general;</p>
<p>Alexander, a virus, doing great damage to the entire system;</p>
<p>Trophimus in the inﬁrmary;</p>
<p>absent were Crescens and Titus;</p>
<p>oﬀ on a mission was Tychicus to secure the reinforcement—Timothy;</p>
<p>while maintaining other fronts were Erastus in Corinth and Prisca, Aquila, </p>
<p>Onesiphorus and his supply depot in Ephesus.</p>
<p>is was Paul’s army of Christ, wounded, as was his own body,</p>
<p>as together they fought the good ﬁght.</p>
