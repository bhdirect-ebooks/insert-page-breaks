<p>Timothy Needs to Continue in Ministry despite Opposition (3:1—4:8) </p>
<p>119</p>
<p>Paul now lists ve words that all begin in Greek with not (the a priva-</p>
<p>tive): disobedient, unthankful, unholy, unloving, irreconcilable (3:2–3). </p>
<p>Disobedience to parents (3:2) may appear of a dierent character than the </p>
<p>other qualities in this list. However, children’s attitudes to parents is im-</p>
<p>portant, being also mentioned in 1 Timothy (3:4–5; 5:4, 8) and Titus (1:6) </p>
<p>and in the Ten Commandments (Exod 20:12). Disobedience is a quality of </p>
<p>the heretical circumcision party (Titus 1:16) and of non-Christians (Rom </p>
<p>1:30). Disobedience contrasts with righteous wisdom (Luke 1:17). ese </p>
<p>are children who refuse to be persuaded by Christ’s truth.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unthankful (acharistos) is a characteristic of non-Christians (Luke </p>
<p>6:35) because non-Christians do not thank God or honor God despite </p>
creation manifesting God’s power and divine nature (Rom 1:20–21).
<p>ankfulness (charistos) is an aspect of God’s grace (charis), which over-</p>
<p>ows from God’s character toward humans (2 Tim 1:9; 2:1). Unthankful-</p>
<p>ness to God may result in acts lacking holiness that are profane (anosios; </p>
<p>unholy). Obedience to parents (3:2) should be based on a relationship of </p>
<p>aection between parents and children,</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> but in these last days this is lack-</p>
<p>ing. Some people refuse to make a truce with God; they are implacable or </p>
<p>irreconcilable.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Slanderous (diabolos; 3:3) is a synonym of “blasphemous”</p>
<p>(blasphēmos; 3:2), employing the same word as the Slanderer par excellence, </p>
<p>the devil, for the act of lying, deceiving, speaking falsely against others.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul then has a second set of words that begin in Greek with the a </p>
<p>privative: without self-control (3:3), without strength, dissolute (akratēs),</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p>not tame, savage (anēmeros), and not loving the good (aphilagathos). Lack </p>
<p>of self-control is a servant of love of self-pleasure, possibly leading to sav-</p>
<p>age, bestial, behavior, as opposed to gentle behavior (2:24–25)</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>that ends</p>
<p>with no longer loving the good. Loving goodness is an essential quality for </p>
<p>an elder, the opposite of demonic behavior.</p>

<p>11. See Titus 3:3.</p>
<p>12. “Aection,” storgē; LSJ, 262, 1650 vs. astorgos, unloving (2 Tim 3:3; Rom 1:31).</p>
<p>13. Aspondos; LSJ, 260.</p>
<p>14. See Titus 2:3.</p>
<p>15. Husband and wife are not to deprive one another sexually too long for the sake of </p>
<p>prayer because then they could be tempted by lack of self-control (1 Cor 7:5). See also 1 </p>
<p>Tim 2:15 (Spencer 2013); 2 Tim 1:7.</p>
<p>16. BDAG, 79, 438; LSJ, 137, 771; ayer, 45.</p>
