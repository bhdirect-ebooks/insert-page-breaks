<p>Hellenistic Jews, or (c) proto-gnostics.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>Many Essenes did not marry, were</p>
<p>ascetic, had food and Sabbath restrictions, were hierarchical, and thought </p>
<p>matter was evil.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>e Book of Jubilees (circa 160–50 BC) is a proto-Essene</p>
<p>document</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>that illustrates many of the false Jewish teachers’ concerns.</p>
<p>It is a paraphrase or commentary (midrash) of parts of Genesis and Exo-</p>
<p>dus. However, in contrast to Genesis, its main focus is the law. ose who </p>
<p>“search out the Law” will be persecuted (1:12) and when children begin </p>
<p>again “to search the law” God’s blessed time will have arrived (Jub 23:26; cf. </p>
<p>Titus 3:9; Gal 4:21; 5:18). Jubilees highlights the importance of observing </p>
<p>the Sabbath (Jub 2:24–33; 50:1–13; vs. Col 2:16), observing the moon and </p>
<p>time (6:32–38; 49:10), and not eating blood (6:11–14; 7:27–33; 21:18–20; </p>
<p>vs. Col 2:16). Circumcision is also indispensable (15:25–34; 16:25). Uncir-</p>
<p>cumcised men cannot be forgiven. It is an “eternal error.”</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>Hebrew is “the</p>
<p>tongue of creation” (Jub 12:26; vs. 2 Cor 11:22). e author shows a fascina-</p>
<p>tion with angels (Jub 2:2, 18; 15:27; cf. Col 2:18). Perfection is possible (e.g., </p>
<p>Abraham 23:10; Jacob 35:12; cf. Titus 3:5; Phil 3:8–9). True Israelites are to </p>
<p>keep separate from Gentiles and not even eat with them (Jub 22:16; 30:7; </p>
<p>vs. Gal 2:12–13).</p>
<p>107</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Certainly, we cannot determine the particular books used at Crete or </p>
<p>Ephesus, but Jubilees exemplies the type of thinking that would be similar </p>
<p>to the Judaizers in Crete and Ephesus.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some second-century gnostics such as the Encratites abstained from </p>
<p>marriage and animal food.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>Full-blown Gnosticism was a second-century</p>
<p>phenomenon, but some proto-gnostics lived in the rst century, such as </p>
<p>Simon Magus and Cerinthus. Simon, a Samaritan, who in Acts already </p>

<p>siah and some of the Apocrypha was “fabricated by certain heretics of his own day” </p>
<p>(Eusebius, Hist. eccl. 4.22 [7–9]). Ebionites, who rejected Paul’s writings (they used only </p>
<p>Matthew’s Gospel or the Gospel according to the Hebrews) because they thought Paul </p>
<p>was “apostate from the law,” according to Irenaeus, “circumcise themselves and continue </p>
