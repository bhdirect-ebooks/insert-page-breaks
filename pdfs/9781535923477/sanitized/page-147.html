<p>2 TIMOTHY 4</p>
<p>Proclaim the Word (4:1–6) </p>
<p>Paul then concludes by exhorting Timothy, in light of Jesus’ judgment, to </p>
<p>proclaim the word at all times because a time is coming when people will </p>
<p>turn from healthy teaching to myths (4:1–5). He gives a solemn warning: </p>
<p>I am charging, in the presence of God and Christ Jesus, the one com-</p>
<p>ing to judge the living and dead, and in his appearing and his kingdom: </p>
<p>proclaim the word, take a stand in season, out of season, reprove, re-</p>
<p>buke, encourage, in all compassion and teaching (4:1–2). Believers need </p>
<p>to mature spiritually (3:17) because they will face the judgment. Paul had </p>
<p>used the exact rst seven words in 1 Timothy 5:21 (I am charging in the </p>
<p>presence of God and Christ Jesus) in similar locations in each letter (about </p>
<p>one chapter before the close of the letter). He exhorts Timothy about a seri-</p>
<p>ous content in a serious manner</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>on three bases: (1) God as his witness,</p>
<p>(2) Christ’s appearing, and (3) Christ’s kingdom. Christ Jesus is described </p>
<p>as the one coming to judge the living and dead (4:1). A judge (krinō/</p>
<p>kritēs) would decide what is just in court trials.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>e last judgment is done</p>
<p>by the Father with the Son.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>But, the Father has entrusted all judgment to</p>
<p>the Son “so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father.”</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Jesus</p>
<p>promises that all who hear his word and believe him who sent him already </p>
<p>have eternal life and do not come under judgment.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Appearing (epiphaneia) is a synonym for the time when Jesus will </p>
<p>judge the world (4:1). Judgment focuses on the serious preparation needed, </p>
<p>while appearing focuses on the glorious event. “Appearing” is reminiscent </p>
<p>of the Aaronic benediction: May the Lord “make his face appear (or shine) </p>
<p>upon you” (Num 6:25). It is a metaphor for deliverance and blessing.</p>
