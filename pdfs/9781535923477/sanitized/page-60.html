<p>Titus 246</p>
<p>slaves to chattel slaves, from those voluntarily in their positions to those </p>
<p>unjustly placed in their positions.</p>
<p>In striking contrast to Aristotle who writes from the master’s perspec-</p>
<p>tive (Pol. I.ii.2–4 [1253b]), 1 Timothy 6:1–2 and Titus 2:9–10 only address </p>
<p>slaves, whereas Ephesians 6:5–9 and Colossians 3:22–4:1 address slaves </p>
<p>and masters,</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>and 1 Peter 2:16–25 addresses free and slave. Both 1 Timothy</p>
<p>6:1 and Titus 2:9 limit the topic to the slaves’ own masters, whereas, since </p>
<p>1 Peter 2:18 is addressed to “household slaves,” Peter assumes that the sub-</p>
<p>mission is limited to one’s own master. Only Titus and 1 Timothy call the </p>
<p>masters despotēs, as opposed to kyrios. Only Titus and Colossians describe </p>
<p>the obedience/submission to be in all/everything. Titus has a number of </p>
<p>unique commands, to the slave not to be opposing nor misappropriating, </p>
<p>but instead showing good faith or trustworthiness. </p>
<p>Like the younger women, the slaves are to subject or submit them-</p>
<p>selves (2:9). First Peter 2:17 orients the attitude of free and slave and helps </p>
<p>dene hypotassō in 1 Peter 2:18 in the same way that Ephesians 5:21, mutual </p>
<p>submission (hypotassō) orients the attitude of all Christians to one another </p>
<p>and helps dene hypotassō in Ephesians 5:22–24.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> First Peter 2:17 chal-</p>
<p>lenges all believers to “honor (timaō) everyone, love the family of believers, </p>
<p>fear God, honor the emperor.” us, slaves, as all Christians, are to honor </p>
<p>others, including their masters, and cooperate with them.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>Slaves, like</p>
<p>women, were in a challenging position. Slaves could hold many responsible </p>
<p>positions in the household. ey could serve as the manager of the house-</p>
<p>hold.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>ey could plow elds, tend sheep, cook meals, invest and develop</p>
<p>the master’s property, collect the rent, represent the landowner or ruler, </p>
<p>be the master’s “apostle” or messenger,</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>and yet their duties and authority</p>
<p>were temporary as opposed to the authority of an heir (John 8:35) and they </p>
<p>had to carry out their master’s orders (Luke 15:22–23; Gal 4:1–2). As Paul </p>
<p>explains: “To their own master they stand or fall” (Rom 14:4; TNIV). us, </p>
<p>Paul exhorts slaves to get free if they can and he exhorts free people to try </p>
<p>not to become a slave (1 Cor 7:21, 23). In other words, for some people </p>
<p>44. In contrast to the NT, the Didache addresses rst the masters, then the slaves </p>
