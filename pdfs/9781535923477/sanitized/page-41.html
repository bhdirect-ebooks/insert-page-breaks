<p>Set Straight (1:5–16)</p>

<p>he challenged some Jews who thought they were teachers to the ignorant: </p>
<p>“Will you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you </p>
<p>steal? You that forbid adultery, do you commit adultery? You that abhor </p>
<p>idols, do you rob temples? You that boast in the law, do you dishonor God </p>
<p>by breaking the law? For, as it is written, ‘e name of God is blasphemed </p>
<p>among the Gentiles because of you’” (Rom 2:21–24; NRSV). He also </p>
<p>claimed that those who required circumcision were avoiding persecution </p>
<p>for the cross of Christ (Gal 6:12). ey remove “the oense of the cross” </p>
<p>(Gal 5:11). Sometimes those who insist on “self-abasement” (Col 2:18) are </p>
<p>the very same people who indulge their esh. Paul warns that regulations </p>
<p>appear to help in promoting piety, but “they lack any value in restraining </p>
<p>sensual indulgence” (Col 2:23; TNIV).</p>
<p>Because many, especially of the circumcision party, are disobedient </p>
<p>to God’s truth, talk without teaching God’s truth, and deceive people, Titus </p>
<p>needs to: rebuke them rigorously, in order that they may be healthy in </p>
<p>the faith, not paying attention to Jewish myths and human command-</p>
<p>ments, turning for themselves away (being turned away) from the truth </p>
<p>(1:13b–14). People can err either on the side of harsh narrow-mindedness </p>
<p>or lax permissiveness. e promotion of truth necessitates a balance be-</p>
<p>tween compassion and integrity. In Titus, the goal is health, healthy faith </p>
<p>and healthy teaching (1:9, 13; 2:1–2, 8). Good health is a reoccurring and </p>
<p>helpful metaphor in the Pastorals.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>God warned the Israelites that “I am</p>
<p>the Lord who heals” those who obey his statutes (Exod 15:26). Jesus ex-</p>
<p>plained that he ate with sinners because, like a physician, his intention was </p>
<p>to heal the sick (Luke 5:30–31). Good health necessitates honest diagnosis </p>
<p>and a rigorous program of avoiding unhealthy habits and foods and pro-</p>
<p>moting healthy habits and foods. In the same way, spiritual health requires </p>
individuals (Titus) and groups of people (elders/overseers) who are vigi-
<p>lant to do something about teachings that turn people away from the truth. </p>
<p>Frequently elenchō (rebuke) is balanced o by parakaleō (“encourage”) </p>
<p>because a good physician promotes health and discourages sickness (e.g., </p>
<p>1:9). Elenchō has to do with bringing deeds and thoughts out in the open </p>
<p>for clarity and truth (e.g., John 3:20; Eph 5:11, 13). e secrets of the heart </p>
<p>are disclosed by prophetic teaching (1 Cor 14:24–25). Titus and the elders </p>
<p>are assisted by prophets (1 Cor 14:24–25), the law (Jas 2:9), and the Holy </p>
<p>Spirit (John 16:8–11). But the intention is not malicious; rather, conviction </p>
<p>96. Two-thirds of the NT uses of hygiainō occur in the Pastoral Letters (four of eight </p>
<p>in Titus). 1 Tim 1:10; 6:3; 2 Tim 1:13; 4:3; Titus 1:9, 13; 2:1, 2, 8 (hygiēs).</p>
