<p>2 TIMOTHY 1</p>
<p>Address (1:1–2)</p>
<p>Paul reminds Timothy that he was appointed an apostle</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>of Christ Jesus</p>
<p>through God’s will.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> is appointment is indispensable for Paul’s conver-</p>
<p>sion. Paul had been redirected from persecution of Christians to promo-</p>
<p>tion of Christianity. Ananias had told him that God had chosen him to </p>
<p>know “God’s will” (Acts 22:4–5, 14). Paul had previously referred to this </p>
<p>crucial change in his life and to eternal life (1 Tim 1:12–16). Paradoxically, </p>
<p>in a situation where death is imminent, Paul emphasizes the promise of </p>
<p>eternal life, only present in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>In the rst letter, Paul addresses Timothy as “genuine child” (1:1), </p>
<p>as he did also Titus (1:4), but now Paul writes to Timothy, beloved child </p>
<p>(1:2). Beloved is a term that Paul has used to describe a father-son (or </p>
<p>parent-child) relationship. A good father or parent “puts in (the) mind” </p>
<p>(noutheteō)</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> of the child good content, teaches, warns, exhorts, admon-</p>
<p>ishes, because the parent is genuinely concerned for the child, unlike a </p>
<p>pedagogue, an enslaved instructor who has been ordered to teach the basics </p>
<p>(1 Cor 4:14–17; Gal 3:24). To the Corinthians, Paul had described Timothy </p>
<p>as a beloved child because he had begotten him spiritually (gennaō) and </p>
<p>Timothy’s way of life was identical to his spiritual father’s (1 Cor 4:15–17). </p>
<p>Beloved children imitate their parent(s), as believers should imitate God </p>
<p>(Eph 5:1–2). Loving parents provide a good model.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>us, using beloved</p>
<p>for Timothy reminds Timothy of their loving familial relationship which </p>
<p>they had had for about twenty years since Acts 14:8.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Although Paul uses</p>
<p>1. See 1 Tim 1:1 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>2. He refers to God’s will also in 1 Cor 1:1; 2 Cor 1:1; Eph 1:1; Col 1:1.</p>
<p>3. Paul will return to the topic of life in 1:10. See Titus 1:2; 3:7; 1 Tim 1:16; 4:8; 6:12, </p>
<p>19.</p>
<p>4. ayer, 429.</p>
<p>5. See also 1 ess 2:7–12, where Paul uses the image of a father (and mother) with </p>
<p>his own children who appeals and encourages and pleads to them to lead lives worthy of </p>
<p>God. “Beloved” is also used by God the Father about God the Son: Matt 3:17; 12:18; 17:5; </p>
<p>Mark 1:11; 9:7; Luke 3:22; 2 Pet 1:17.</p>
<p>6. See also Phil 2:22.</p>
