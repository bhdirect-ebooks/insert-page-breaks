<p>Teach What Is Consistent with Healthy Doctrine (2:1—3:11)</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>sounds (1 Cor 14:11; 13:11) and for authoritative revelation from God.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>Titus 2:1, 15, Paul wants Titus to speak the true teaching from God about </p>
<p>mature Christian qualities (2:2–10) and the nature of God (2:11–14).</p>
<p>Parakaleō (encourage) and elenchō (reprove, 2:15) are used earlier in </p>
<p>Titus (1:9) in contrast to each other. Parakaleō literally signies “to call to </p>
<p>one’s side.”</p>
<p>82</p>
<p> Its use in legal situations can form a helpful basis for under-</p>
<p>standing its other uses. In legal situations, parakaleō can mean to “summon </p>
<p>one’s friends to attend one in a trial, . . . call them as witnesses, . . . summon </p>
<p>a defendant into court” or simply “appeal to.”</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>First, as a defendant appeals</p>
<p>to friends for help, God and Christians can appeal to (as opposed to com-</p>
<p>mand) people to do an act.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p> e appeal can be to do something good,</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>to watch out for wrong teaching and behavior (Rom 16:17), or to change </p>
<p>behavior.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>Second, as a witness supports a friend, God and Christians can</p>
<p>help others in dicult times.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>ird, when a witness supports a friend, the</p>
<p>friend feels the support. In the same way, change of behavior or good news </p>
<p>or education can encourage the friend.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>Both Titus and Timothy are to</p>
<p>teach and encourage.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> In Titus 2:15, the rst meaning of parakaleō (“ap-</p>
<p>peal”) would t well in a context where healthy teaching is needed.</p>
<p>Elenchō (reprove, 2:15) in the New Testament predominantly has to </p>
<p>do with bringing sin out to the open. For example, Jesus explains, “For all </p>
<p>who do evil hate the light and do not come to the light, so that their deeds </p>
<p>may not be exposed.”</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>It can be part of an attempt to become reconciled</p>
<p>(Matt 18:15). It can also result in destructive retaliation (Luke 3:19–20); </p>
<p>therefore its basis should be love. Its goal is repentance.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>All Persons of</p>
<p>the Trinity convict people of sin.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>Authentic preaching also should result</p>
<p>in conviction of sin (1 Cor 14:24). Although parakaleō (“appeal to”) is not </p>
