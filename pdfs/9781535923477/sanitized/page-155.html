<p>Receive a Just Crown (4:6–8)</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>crown were cut with a golden sickle by a boy both of whose parents were </p>
<p>living, from the sacred olive tree that grew at the west end of the Temple </p>
<p>of Zeus, where even to-day the wild olive may be seen.”</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>e metaphor</p>
<p>of an imperishable crown, or crown of life and glory that never fades, was </p>
<p>used by several New Testament authors.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>In times of persecution, a reward</p>
<p>is important to motivate people to persevere.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p> In this last letter, Paul de-</p>
<p>scribes the crown as laid up, held in reserve for him</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>and mentions three</p>
<p>things about it: (1) what kind of crown it is, (2) who will give it, and (3) who </p>
<p>will get it (4:8). </p>
<p>Instead of olive branches, which are imperishable and become brittle, </p>
<p>God’s crown partakes of the same nature as the judge who bestows it. </p>
<p>Dikaiosynē and dikaios may be rendered just or righteous (4:8), which de-</p>
<p>scribes God’s character (Deut 32:4). It may refer to the judge in a court, but </p>
<p>here it is the judge of an athletic contest. e highest honors were bestowed </p>
<p>by emperors. Sometimes ancient matches were arranged beforehand,</p>
<p>58</p>
<p> </p>
<p>however, Jesus as judge cannot be bribed, but is always just and holy. In </p>
<p>the Pastorals, dikaios and dikaiosynē always are synonyms of “holy.” Timo-</p>
<p>thy has been exhorted to pursue this characteristic,</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>to be a person who</p>
<p>observes God’s rules. No one can be perfectly righteous, except Jesus, the </p>
<p>Righteous One.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> Nevertheless, at the nal judgment, the pursuing of righ-</p>
<p>teousness will be completed because it will be awarded.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Apodidōmi (will grant) in 4:8 is clearly positive, while in 4:14 it is </p>
<p>negative. It can be a reward or a punishment.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>e verb is oen used in</p>
<p>legal situations, such as paying back debts,</p>
<p>63</p>
<p> paying taxes or shares,</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>paying</p>
<p>wages (Matt 20:8), and giving conjugal obligations (1 Cor 7:3). e crown </p>
