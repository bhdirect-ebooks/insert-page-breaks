<p>Set Straight (1:5–16)</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>An accusation (katēgoria, katēgoreō) then was a formal aair. For ex-</p>
<p>ample, Paul refers to formal accusations against elders in 1 Timothy 5:19, </p>
<p>reminding the church that two or three witnesses were needed, alluding to </p>
<p>Deuteronomy 19:15. In the New Testament, such accusations before the </p>
<p>Jewish religious leaders or Roman political leaders could lead to excom-</p>
<p>munication from the synagogue and death.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>Katēgorēo and katēgoria refer</p>
<p>especially to an accusation before judges.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>us, an elder should not be</p>
<p>recommended for leadership if that elder or a child living in the household </p>
<p>is under a serious accusation process.</p>
<p>e overseer is God’s steward (1:7). A “steward” (oikonomos) was the </p>
<p>manager of a household. e owner entrusted the management of aairs </p>
<p>to the oikonomos: the oversight of the property, receiving and paying bills, </p>
<p>planning expenditures, apportioning food, and overseeing minors.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>ey</p>
<p>had to be trustworthy.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>Erastus, for example, was a city “manager” (Rom</p>
<p>16:23). Overseers or elders were managers of church life. e owner of their </p>
<p>property is “God” (Titus 1:7).</p>
<p>Paul enumerates ve failings to avoid that would make God’s steward </p>
<p>trustworthy (not self-pleasing, not prone to anger, not given to getting </p>
<p>drunk, not pugnacious, not fond of shameful gain; 1:7) and seven quali-</p>
<p>ties to cultivate to make God’s steward trustworthy (but be hospitable, lov-</p>
<p>ing what is good, wise, righteous, holy, self-controlled, holding fast the </p>
<p>faithful word according to the teaching; 1:8–9). God’s manager must be </p>
<p>willing to please God, not only oneself (not self-pleasing; authadēs).</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>If a</p>
<p>manager is prone to anger without cause,</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>that will result in unnecessary</p>
<p>conict (Prov 29:22). Jesus spoke against anger without a good cause, as </p>
<p>from envy, which can be a precondition to murder. Anger is a violent emo-</p>
<p>tion that can lead to a violent action. It disparages the listener. e opposite </p>
<p>is reconciliation or peacemaking.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>Anger is also infectious. Simply being</p>
<p>the property. Strabo, Geogr. 10.4.16, 20; Plato, Leg. I.625C-626A; Aristotle, Pol. II.ii.10 </p>

<p>53. Xenophon mentions the importance of loyalty for a steward (Oec. XII [5]).</p>
<p>54. God can express a just anger, with good cause (e.g., Rev 11:18; Matt 18:34; 22:7).</p>
