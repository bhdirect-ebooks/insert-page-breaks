<p>Fusing the Horizons: e Place of Grace74</p>
<p>who invited me to come at the last moment told me to go on my own because </p>
<p>she was coming with her boyfriend. Did I feel abandoned? Yes. I was attend-</p>
<p>ing an all women’s college and I had to go across town by bus to an all men’s </p>
<p>college at night. It was my ﬁrst time. I was terriﬁed! I had to ﬁnd a speciﬁc </p>
<p>classroom building in a strange school, but all the buildings were deserted </p>
<p>and nameless and there was no one to ask. The Christian group met on the top </p>
<p>ﬂoor of one empty building. No signs or people were at the bottom to welcome </p>
<p>me. But, as I rode across town in the empty college bus and walked across the </p>
<p>strange quad and slowly dragged my feet up the many stairs, I felt as if I were </p>
<p>in a clear bubble, a cloud, that enveloped me and brought me along. My feet </p>
<p>still moved, but this bubble stayed with me throughout the journey, enabling </p>
<p>me to do the impossible—what even appeared to be ridiculous. But, when I </p>
<p>ﬁnally arrived, I was wholeheartedly welcomed by the Christian believers with </p>
<p>open arms.</p>
<p>God was with me. God is still with me. God was with me as I entered </p>
<p>the kingdom and God is with me as I live each day in the kingdom. In the old </p>
<p>covenant, God allays Moses’ fears when God tells Moses: “I will be with you” </p>
<p>(Exod 3:12). Jesus, Emmanuel (“God is with us”), also promises, “Behold, I </p>
<p>myself am with you every day, until the end of the ages” (Matt 1:23; 28:20). </p>
<p>Paul too tells the Athenians that God would always be with them too because </p>
<p>in God “we are living and we are moving and we are being” (Acts 17:28).</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Thus, as I experienced personally, Grace is the contextual bubble in which </p>
<p>good deeds are done and Grace carries, guides, and instructs us all along the </p>
<p>way. </p>
