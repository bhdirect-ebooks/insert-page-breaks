<p>2 Timothy 2106</p>
<p>handling the word of truth (2:15). Timothy must not concern himself </p>
<p>with being approved by those who are on a road to destruction. Rather, his </p>
<p>judge is God. And, although he has been saved by grace (1:9), he still needs </p>
<p>to make every eort (spoudazō) to please God. As Onesiphorus’ household </p>
<p>made extensive eort to nd Paul (1:17), Timothy is to make that same </p>
<p>extensive eort to present himself approved. ese are times of urgency, </p>
<p>when Paul exhorts his coworkers to hasten and exert themselves in com-</p>
<p>ing to see him.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>With that same urgency, he wants Timothy to work on</p>
<p>his spiritual maturity. Approved (dokimos) may be used to describe pure </p>
<p>metals that sustain their structure even if cast into a furnace.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>ey are</p>
<p>genuine. Humans too demonstrate the genuineness of their character by </p>
<p>persevering through trials (Jas 1:12). Timothy also should extend eort to </p>
<p>persist as a genuine believer and thus become approved or commended by </p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul further denes what it means to be approved by God with three </p>
<p>modiers: (1) a worker, (2) who does not need to be ashamed, and (3) </p>
<p>rightly handling the word of truth (2:15). A worker is someone who </p>
<p>“makes every eort.” erefore, they are not ashamed. Paul alludes to Jesus’ </p>
<p>exhortation to his disciples: of those who are ashamed of Jesus and of his </p>
<p>words, Jesus “will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father </p>
<p>with the holy angels.”</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>Of what not to be ashamed has been an important</p>
<p>topic in this letter: the testimony of the Lord and of Paul, the Lord’s pris-</p>
<p>oner.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>Now, Timothy himself is to be unashamed, probably because he is</p>
<p>making every eort to present himself approved to God and he is rightly </p>
<p>handling the word of truth (2:15). By the context, it appears that others, by </p>
<p>their word-battles, are not interpreting the word of truth rightly (e.g., but </p>
<p>rather, deceptively; 3:13). </p>
<p>How should Timothy handle the word of truth? He should do so </p>
<p>rightly, that is, cutting it in a straight line (orthotomeō).</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>Wisdom can</p>
<p>“rightly direct” one’s paths (Prov 3:6) and righteousness blamelessly cuts </p>
<p>73. 2 Tim 4:9, 21; Titus 3:12, 13. 40 percent of the uses of the verb (spoudazō) and the </p>
<p>adverb (spoudaōs; six of een times) are found in the Pastorals.</p>
