<p>2 Timothy 2104</p>
<p>In a time when one’s testimony for Jesus Christ, “risen from the dead, </p>
<p>from David’s seed” (2:8), might cause diculties, the temptation is to deny </p>
<p>one’s faith or become unfaithful: if we will deny, also that one will deny us </p>
<p>(2:12b). Denying one’s faith may be by words or by action.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p> Several believ-</p>
<p>ers in Rome had already denied Jesus, by deserting Paul.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>Jesus had warned</p>
<p>his disciples that whoever denies our Lord before others, he also would </p>
<p>deny him/her before his Father in heaven (Matt 10:33). Human action re-</p>
sults in divine action. Instead, Jesus’ followers were to deny themselves and
<p>take up their cross daily and follow him (Luke 9:23).</p>
<p>To deny someone is to say “no” to someone.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> God allows human ac-</p>
<p>tion and decision. However, human unfaithfulness does not nullify God’s </p>
<p>faithfulness:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>if we are unfaithful, that one remains faithful, for he is not </p>
<p>able to deny himself (2:13).</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> Paul described himself as unfaithful, a blas-</p>
<p>phemer, persecutor, and violent person who received mercy.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>But even</p>
<p>though humans may not remain consistent, God the Trinity always will </p>
<p>keep God’s promises. God’s very nature is truth and faithfulness and cannot </p>
<p>act outside itself.</p>
<p>Avoid Ungodly Talking, </p>
<p>BecomeaVesselforGoodWorks(2:14–26)</p>
<p>With this summary statement (2:11–13), Paul concludes the rst section of </p>
<p>his letter, explaining why Timothy should not be ashamed to suer for the </p>
<p>gospel, nor of Paul’s suering (1:3–2:13). What Paul has just told Timothy is </p>
<p>not simply for Timothy’s own edication, but it is to be passed on to others: </p>
<p>these things keep reminding (2:14a). ese things refer to what Paul has </p>
<p>just said in 1:3—2:13.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> Timothy is also to remind the church about mat-</p>
<p>ters brought up in more length in 1 Timothy and Titus: while charging in </p>
<p>the presence of God not to dispute about words, useful for nothing, for </p>
<p>destruction of the ones hearing (2:14b). In this second section of his letter, </p>
<p>63. 1 Tim 5:8; Titus 1:16.</p>
<p>64. 2 Tim 1:15; 4:10, 14–16. Despite promising to die together with Jesus, should it be </p>
<p>necessary, and never to desert him, Peter did desert him and would not even acknowl-</p>
<p>edge he had been with him (Mark 14:29–31, 68–72).</p>
<p>65. See Titus 2:12.</p>
<p>66. Also Rom 3:3–4.</p>
<p>67. See 1 Tim 1:13 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>68. See 2 Tim 1:5.</p>
