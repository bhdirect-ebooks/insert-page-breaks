<p>Timothy Needs to Continue in Ministry despite Opposition (3:1—4:8) </p>
<p>129</p>
<p>the twenty-two books of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p> In accordance with Deuter-</p>
<p>onomy 4:2, Josephus mentions that no one has added, removed, or altered </p>
<p>a syllable “and it is an instinct with every Jew, from the day of his birth, </p>
<p>to regard them as the decrees of God, to abide by them, and, if need be, </p>
<p>cheerfully to die for them” (Ag. Ap. 8 [42]).</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>Writings (gramma), by itself,</p>
<p>refers to anything written, including the Bible.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>e adjective holy claries</p>
<p>to which writings Paul refers.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>Paul himself treats the Old Testament as</p>
<p>authoritative and reliable. He also treats the Gospel of Luke as Scripture.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>In addition, Paul explains that these holy writings are the ones being </p>
<p>able to make you wise (3:15). A wise person could be someone learned, an </p>
<p>expert, skilled in letters.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>James denes genuinely wise teachers as people</p>
<p>who prove their actions by their good conduct characterized by gentle wis-</p>
<p>dom (Jas 3:13). erefore, in a practical sense, a wise person is one who in </p>
<p>action is governed by piety and integrity.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>e wise person understands the</p>
<p>Lord’s will (Eph 5:15–17) and will not be led astray (3:13). e law of the </p>
<p>Lord makes even infants wise (Ps 18:7; LXX). By study of the law, righteous </p>
<p>people become wiser than even their teachers or enemies (Ps 119:97–99). </p>
<p>Since God is wise (Rom 16:27), God’s writings make people wise.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>But not all wisdom leads to knowledge of truth.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> erefore, Paul clari-</p>
<p>es to what kind of wisdom he refers with two prepositional phrases: into </p>
<p>salvation through faith (3:15). e phrases explain the goal and means </p>
<p>through which wisdom is obtained. To be saved is to be forgiven one’s sins </p>
<p>and, thus, be puried, made acceptable to a holy God. God, the Savior, does </p>
<p>the purifying, but humans must cooperate in this process.</p>

<p>Study of the</p>
<p>86. E.g., Josephus, Ag. Ap. 8 (38). e Hebrew Bible groups its books at twenty-two or </p>
<p>twenty-four (Harris 1969: 142–43).</p>
<p>87. Nevertheless, in practice, eventually the oral teachings or interpretation of the </p>
<p>Scriptures, came to have equal or greater authority (e.g., m. Qidd. 1:10), which Jesus </p>
<p>combatted (e.g., Mark 7:8–13).</p>
<p>88. Luke 16:6–7; John 5:47; Acts 28:21; Gal 6:11; 1 Macc 5:10. Josephus uses gramm<span class="_ _2" />a </p>
<p>to refer to the Old Testament (Ag. Ap. 1. 8 [42]).</p>
<p>89. Also Rom 1:2. ese writings contrast with the Ephesians’ writings of magicians </p>
<p>(Acts 19:19; Lock 1924: 109).</p>
<p>90. See 1 Tim 5:18 (Spencer 2013). Peter cites Paul as Scripture (2 Pet 3:16).</p>
<p>91. ayer, 582.</p>
<p>92. Ibid.</p>
<p>93. See also synonym Titus 2:2. All should learn from Scriptures (1 Tim 4:13).</p>
<p>94. E.g., Matt 11:25; Luke 10:21; 1 Cor 1:19–20; Isa 44:25; Jer 8:8–9.</p>
<p>95. See 1 Tim 2:3–4 (Spencer 2013); Titus 3:5.</p>
