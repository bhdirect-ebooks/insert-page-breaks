<p>2 Timothy 4134</p>
<p>the appearing all will know Jesus is God (Ezek 39:28). An “appearing” was </p>
<p>a “glorious manifestation.”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why now add kingdom (basileia) as the third basis for his charge </p>
<p>(4:1)? Aer the judgment and the appearing, Christ will set up his king-</p>
<p>dom. Paul looks forward to Christ’s kingdom (4:18). Jesus did much teach-</p>
<p>ing on God’s kingdom,</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> as did Paul.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>e kingdom is not food and drink</p>
<p>but “righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit” (Rom 14:17). e </p>
<p>wicked will not inherit it.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>e perishable will become imperishable (1 Cor</p>
<p>15:50–55). People who are forgiven and lead a life worthy of God may en-</p>
<p>ter Christ’s kingdom.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>As eternal life (2 Tim 1:1), Christ’s kingdom begins</p>
<p>now and extends forever. </p>
<p>Paul now gives his ve-part charge: to proclaim, take a stand, re-</p>
<p>prove, rebuke, encourage (4:2).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Timothy is not merely supposed to do</p>
<p>these actions because of his personal opinions or habits,</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>but he should</p>
<p>do them based on remaining in what he learned from his knowledge of the </p>
<p>Holy Scriptures and from his teachers (3:14–16). First, Timothy is exhorted </p>
<p>to proclaim the word. Why does Paul not write “teach the word,” “proph-</p>
<p>esy,” “heal the sick,” “do wonders and miracles” as one of these ve main </p>
<p>commands, especially since the rst function of the Scripture is to teach </p>
<p>(3:16)? Preaching or proclaiming is an action all believers are to do, but </p>
<p>especially evangelists, such as Timothy and Philip.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>A preacher is a herald,</p>
<p>a messenger from the Scripture (the word) to the people.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>A preacher or</p>
<p>evangelist brings good news (Rom 10:14–15). Jesus at the end of his earthly </p>
<p>ministry exhorted his disciples “to proclaim in his name repentance for </p>
<p>7. ayer, 245. Antiochus called himself “Epiphanes” (Epiphanē) but he was super-</p>
<p>seded by the real God’s epiphaneia, “manifest signs that came from heaven” that mani-</p>
<p>fested God’s power and glory and delivered the people (2 Macc 2:20–21; 3:24; 14:15; </p>
<p>15:27; 3 Macc 2:9; 2 ess 2:8. See also 1 Tim 6:14 (Spencer 2013); Titus 2:13; 2 Tim 1:10; </p>
<p>4:8). Of the eleven references of the noun and its cognates in the NT, seven occur in the </p>
<p>Pastorals (64 percent).</p>
<p>8. E.g., Luke 4:43.</p>
<p>9. Acts 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31.</p>
<p>10. 1 Cor 6:9–10; Gal 5:19–21; Eph 5:5; Rev 22:15.</p>
<p>11. Col 1:13–14; 1 ess 2:12.</p>
<p>12. Paul uses ve aorist imperatives that treat each action as a single whole irrespec-</p>
<p>tive of the time involved (Robertson 1934: 832).</p>
<p>13. Also 2 Cor 4:5.</p>
<p>14. 2 Tim 4:5; Acts 8:5; 21:8.</p>
<p>15. See 1 Tim 2:7; 3:16 (Spencer 2013).</p>
