<p>Greetings (4:19–22)</p>
<p>159</p>
<p>bishops of Rome for two centuries all lived at Pudens’s home at Via Urbana </p>
<p>in Rome.</p>
<p>164</p>
<p>Paul closes with a brief two-part benediction: e Lord be with your </p>
<p>spirit. Grace be with you (4:22). e rst sentence is addressed to Timothy </p>
<p>since your is singular, while the second sentence is addressed to the church, </p>
<p>since you is plural. e Lord had been present with Paul during his rst </p>
<p>defense and rescued him (4:17–18).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>165</p>
<p>Paul would want the same benets</p>
<p>for Timothy as he joins him in suering for Christ. Paul and Timothy could </p>
<p>be assured the Lord was with them because Jesus promised it: “Behold I </p>
<p>myself am with you all the days until the end of the age” (Matt 28:20).</p>
<p>Paul uses pneuma in the Pastorals to refer to the human spirit (2 Tim </p>
<p>1:7; 1 Tim 3:16) as well as to the Holy Spirit (2 Tim 1:14; 1 Tim 4:1; Titus </p>
<p>3:5). e human spirit is that inner aspect of a person that self-examines </p>
<p>and reaches up to communicate to God’s Spirit with the Holy Spirit’s aid.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e human spirit, so necessary for life,</p>
<p>167</p>
<p>comprehends deep thoughts</p>
<p>within oneself and within others.</p>
<p>168</p>
<p>Paul closes this letter with the same</p>
<p>farewell as in 1 Timothy.</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>By using the plural you, he shows that, although</p>
<p>he addresses Timothy, he writes to him in the context of the whole church. </p>
<p>In 2 Timothy, grace was in Christ Jesus and revealed in the incarnation and </p>
<p>is available to humans.</p>
<p>170</p>
<p> us, the Lord is present in a personal, compas-</p>
<p>sionate, and merciful manner.</p>

<p>165. In 2 Tim the Lord explicitly refers to Christ Jesus (1:2, 8) or is not specied </p>
<p>(1:16, 18; 2:7, 19, 22, 24; 3:11; 4:8, 14, 17–18). e Lord in 2 Tim is also described as </p>
<p>personal, merciful, giving understanding, a master who helps, and judges.</p>

<p>denes the human spirit as “that dimension of human life which is characterized by the </p>
<p>capacity for interrelating with God” (2006: 655).</p>
