<p>Set Straight (1:5–16)</p>

<p>In 1 Timothy, Paul discusses the law and the misuse of the law (1:8–</p>
<p>10), as he does in Titus (3:9–10). However, in Titus, the circumcision party </p>
<p>is explicitly mentioned and the Jewish aspect of the myths (1:10, 14). In </p>
<p>contrast, in 1 Timothy, the speculative aspect of the myths is described as </p>
<p>“old-women’s myths” (4:7). In Ephesus, diculties with younger widows </p>
<p>are mentioned (1 Tim 5:3–16), but not in Crete. Heterodoxy and the desire </p>
<p>to teach are more explicit in Ephesus (1 Tim 1:3, 6–7; 6:3, 5, 20). Neverthe-</p>
<p>less, both churches are dealing with controversies and quarrels that relate to </p>
<p>genealogies and myths (Titus 1:14; 3:9; 1 Tim 1:4; 4:7). </p>
<p>Circumcision (peritomē; 1:10) is a symbol of the old covenant and </p>
<p>obedience to Moses’ law.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>It can serve as a synecdoche to refer to Jews in</p>
<p>general</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> or to Jewish Christians in particular.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>But Paul argues that real</p>
<p>circumcision is of the heart, not physical and external (Rom 2:28–29; Col </p>
<p>2:11). He points out that Abraham was circumcised as a symbol of imputed </p>
<p>righteousness aer he believed in God (Rom 4:11). us, when some Jew-</p>
<p>ish believers insisted on circumcision and obedience to all of Moses’ laws </p>
<p>and some rabbinic laws, they became a party critical of Paul and Peter.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Exactly what is the Cretan circumcision party teaching? Are they requir-</p>
<p>ing Gentiles to be circumcised (Gal 5:2–4; 6:12–15; Phil 3:2–5)? Are they </p>
<p>requiring Gentiles and Jews to eat only kosher food and celebrate all Old </p>
<p>Testament holidays?</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>Even non-Jews in ancient times were aware of Jewish</p>
<p>food prohibitions.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>Paul does not elaborate, although at Crete and Ephesus</p>
<p>the teaching had to do with “Jewish myths and human commandments” </p>
<p>that veered followers away from God’s truth (Titus 1:14). Whatever was </p>
<p>happening in Crete, however, was motivated by “shameful gain” (1:11). </p>
<p>ose in the circumcision party were out to please themselves by shame-</p>
<p>lessly and deceitfully seeking their own prot (1:7). </p>
<p>To silence (epistomizō; 1:11) has very dierent connotations from </p>
<p>“silence” (hēsychia, hēsychios) in 1 Timothy 2:2, 11–12. Epistomizō literally </p>
<p>72. E.g., John 7:22–23; Acts 7:8; Rom 2:25—3:1; 4:10–12; 1 Cor 7:19; Gal 5:6, 11; </p>
<p>6:15; Phil 3:4–5.</p>
<p>73. Rom 4:12; Gal 2:7–9; Eph 2:11; Phil 3:3; Col 3:11.</p>
<p>74. Acts 10:45; Rom 3:30; 4:9; Col 4:11.</p>
<p>75. Acts 11:2–3; Gal 2:12–13; 5:2–4; John 18:28–29; m. Tehar. 7.2, 5–6.</p>
<p>76. Acts 11:2–3; 10:12–14; Deut 14:3–21; Gal 2:12–13; Col 2:16; 1 Tim 4:3; Rom </p>
<p>14:14–23; Heb 13:9.</p>
<p>77. E.g., Epictetus, Disc. 1.22.11.</p>
