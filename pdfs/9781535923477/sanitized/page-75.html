<p>Live Godly Lives in the World (3:1–8)</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>your souls; for my yoke is comfortable (chrēstos), and my burden is light” </p>
<p>(Matt 11:29–30). Jesus’ yoke is helpful and comfortable.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>In a similar way,</p>
<p>God’s “milk” is wholesome, healthy, and good (1 Pet 2:3).</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>us, when God</p>
<p>is chrēstotēs, God is forgiving toward humans, bringing them health and </p>
<p>wholesomeness.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e second characteristic (philanthrōpia, love for humanity, 3:4) of </p>
<p>the Savior God is a synonym to the rst characteristic (chrēstotēs; kind-</p>
<p>ness). In both of the New Testament examples of love for humanity, </p>
<p>compassion is shown. For instance, the centurion Julius was empathetic to </p>
<p>Paul’s needs when he allowed him, even though he was a prisoner, to visit </p>
<p>his friends at Sidon so they might provide for him (Acts 27:3). e Malta </p>
<p>natives were also empathetic with Paul, Aristarchus, and Luke when they </p>
<p>kindled a re for them in the cold, rainy weather (Acts 28:2).</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ese two aspects of God’s nature, God’s forgiving and empathetic na-</p>
<p>ture, led to their salvation. It was not their own deeds, even their righteous </p>
<p>ones, that saved them.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>If God’s mercy (eleos) saves, what then is the value</p>
<p>of good deeds or actions? In Titus, four valuable aspects of good actions </p>
<p>are mentioned. First, they are a way believers “confess” publicly their belief </p>
<p>in God (1:16). Second, they are part of the educational process, along with </p>
<p>the verbal aspect (2:7). ird, God redeems humans from a sinful life in </p>
<p>order that they might be enthusiastic to do good actions.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>is aspect is</p>
<p>reminiscent of the many Old Testament covenants. For example, the Lord </p>
<p>reminds Moses that “I bore you on eagle’s wings” out of Egypt and now, if </p>
<p>the people “obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured </p>
<p>possession out of all the peoples . . . you shall be for me a priestly kingdom </p>
<p>and a holy nation” (Exod 19:4–6; NRSV). What the New Testament calls </p>
<p>“good actions” would be comparable to keeping God’s covenant. Fourth, </p>
<p>26. With a yoke, two animals could work together, using their broad shoulders, en-</p>
<p>abling them to pull a plow (IDB 4: 924). </p>
<p>27. Or, old wine (as opposed to new wine) is better, tastier, lighter, less alcoholic </p>
<p>(Luke 5:39).</p>
<p>28. See Titus 1:13; 2:8 hygiainō. See also Luke 6:35; Rom 2:4; 11:22; Gal 5:22; Eph 2:7; </p>
<p>4:32; Col 3:12.</p>
<p>29. See also 2 Macc 6:22; 14:9; 3 Macc 3:15; Wis 12:19. Possibly, then, when Paul </p>
<p>encourages younger widows “to love their husbands” (philandros; 2:4), he may be calling </p>
<p>for wives to be compassionate. </p>
<p>30. See also 2 Tim 1:9.</p>
<p>31. Titus 2:14; 3:1. See also 2 Tim 2:21; 3:16–17; John 15:16.</p>
