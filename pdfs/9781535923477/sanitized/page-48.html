<p>Titus 234</p>
<p>tions (male and female “elders”) or simply to age (“old men,” “old women”)? </p>
<p>Many English translations render the latter.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>However, the former is also</p>
<p>possible. Why? First, in ancient times deference was given to elders simply </p>
<p>because of their age.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Second, in the same way as presbyteros could refer to</p>
<p>leadership positions or to age,</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>presbytēs could refer to age or to leadership</p>
<p>positions. Although the Bible does have several references where presbytēs </p>
<p>refers simply to age,</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> other references clearly refer to ambassadors or en-</p>
<p>voys, as the “elders” of the ruler from Babylon who visited Hezekiah (2 </p>
<p>Chr 32:31; LXX) and elders representing the Jews to Sparta and to Rome </p>
<p>(1 Macc 14:22; 15:17; LXX). Even the envoys from Rome are called “elders” </p>
<p>(2 Macc 11:34; LXX). Elders (presbytēs) are also mentioned at the city gate </p>
<p>where judgments were made in Israel (Job 29:7–8; Lam 5:14; LXX). When </p>
<p>Paul calls himself presbytēs, some translators render it “ambassador” (REB, </p>
<p>TEV), while others “old man”/ “aged” (NRSV, NIV, TNIV, KJV) (Phlm 9). </p>
<p>e feminine presbytis occurs only in Titus 2:3 in the Bible. Were </p>
<p>women ever called “elder” implying a leadership position in ancient times? </p>
<p>One heroic “aged” (gēraia) mother of seven sons was called by the au-</p>
<p>thor of 4 Maccabees an “elder” (presbytis) even though a woman (4 Macc </p>
<p>16:14).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>At Crete, a female, Sophia of Gortyn, is described on a plaque as</p>
<p>“elder (presbytera) and ruler of the synagogue.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>A woman, Mannine of</p>
<p>Venosa, thirty-eight-years-old, is described as an “elder” in a cemetery in </p>
<p>Italy. Brooten found six or seven Jewish women “elders” spread over a wide </p>
<p>4. E.g., NRSV, NIV, TNIV, REB, TEV, CEV, NASB, JB have “older men/women.” KJV </p>
<p>has “aged men” and “aged women” (2:2–3). e Spanish versions do not dierentiate </p>
<p>between Titus 1:5–6 and 2:2, 3, rendering them all “anciano/a” (RV, DHH, BA, NVI). </p>
<p>Kroeger agrees (2002: 757) that presbytēs is best understood as a church ocer, a “female </p>
<p>presbyter.”</p>
<p>5. E.g., Lev 19:32; Deut 28:50; Isa 9:14–15; Wis 2:10.</p>
<p>6. See notes on Titus 1:5.</p>
<p>7. E.g., Abraham, Gen 25:8; Jacob, Gen 43:27; Eli, 1 Sam 2:22; 4:18; Zechariah, Luke </p>
<p>1:18.</p>
<p>8. See translation by H. Anderson, OTP 2:561.</p>
<p>9. First through fourth century AD, Brooten 1982: 41. Levine conrms that women </p>
<p>have been identied as elders and rulers of the synagogue (ocials) in the area of Asia </p>
<p>Minor and its immediate surroundings: Smyrna, Crete, Myndos, race, Venosa, Trip-</p>
<p>olitania, Rome, Malta (10 percent of total names mentioned; 2000: 482–83, 487). Horsely </p>
<p>(1987) has found numerous examples of female elders. Moreover, even the term pres-</p>
<p>bytera has been used for women elders in 1 Tim 5:2. All this data contradicts Mounce’s </p>
<p>pronouncement that “there was no position of ‘women elders’ in the Pauline churches or </p>
<p>in the second century (2000: 270).</p>
