<p>Teach What Is Consistent with Healthy Doctrine (2:1—3:11)</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>attack has been an important quality for leaders in Crete because there are </p>
<p>opponents there (1:6, 7, 9) and God’s word could be criticized (2:5). Earlier </p>
<p>the elder is encouraged to be able to reprove those who oppose (1:9). Now, </p>
<p>Titus’ actions, teaching, honor, and words might be so eective as to shame </p>
<p>and silence (entrepō; 2:8) the opponent. Although Crete had a number of </p>
<p>opponents (1:9), Titus can win them one by one (the opponent; 2:8). An </p>
<p>opponent is like a strong wind that could turn over one’s boat (enantios; </p>
<p>Matt 14:24; Acts 27:4). e goal is not to be “turned” oneself but to make </p>
<p>the opponent “turn about” or be shamed and show respect to oneself.</p>
<p>e nal group that Titus needs to encourage to do what is appro-</p>
<p>priate to healthy teaching is slaves: slaves—to their own masters, to be </p>
<p>subject in all, to be well-pleasing, not opposing, not misappropriating </p>
<p>for themselves, but demonstrating for themselves every good trust, in </p>
<p>order that they might honor the teaching, the one of our Savior God, </p>
<p>in all (2:9). e household and the larger Cretan society had free citizens, </p>
<p>serfs, and slaves. e Cretan Gortyn Code refers to woikeus, a person </p>
<p>attached to the household (oikos), and a dolos, a “serf ” or “slave.” Dolos </p>
<p>could refer to the household woikeus or commercial chattel slave (slaves </p>
<p>who were bought and sold like other commodities; e.g., Rev 18:13). Legal </p>
<p>marriage was not allowed between chattel slaves but the serf family could </p>
marry, divorce, and own property. Free citizens could pay a debt by becom-
<p>ing slaves, pledging themselves voluntarily (katakeimenos; e.g., 1 Cor 7:23), </p>
<p>or being condemned to bondage (nenikamenos; e.g., Matt 18:23–25). Serfs </p>
<p>had similar rights to a free citizen except they were restricted from military </p>
<p>aspects such as gymnastic exercises and possession of arms and required to </p>
<p>pay tribute to a landlord. eir status was between that of a full citizen and </p>
<p>chattel slave. Serfs in Crete, unlike other ancient areas, did not successfully </p>
<p>revolt. A slave was not recognized by the law as a responsible person in his </p>
<p>own right and could own no property. Cretans called urban slaves chryson-</p>
<p>etoi (“persons bought for gold”). Some people were enslaved as prisoners of </p>
<p>war (Aristotle, Pol. I.II.18 [1255a]; 2 Macc 8:10–11). When Cretan piracy </p>
<p>increased in Hellenistic times, kidnapping people increased because slave </p>
<p>trading was a protable business.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>However, piracy was largely terminated</p>
<p>by the Romans by the rst century AD.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>Paul’s directions in Titus could</p>
<p>be addressed to people, then, in a variety of situations, from serfs to house </p>
<p>42. See 1 Tim 1:10 (Spencer 2013); and Deut 24:7.</p>
