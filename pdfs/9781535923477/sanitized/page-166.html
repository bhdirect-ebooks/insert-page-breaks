<p>2 Timothy 4152</p>
<p>unharmed because an angel stopped the lion’s mouth, became proverbial </p>
<p>in later Israelite and Christian accounts.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p> Peter aptly describes the Chris-</p>
<p>tian adversary, the devil, “as a roaring lion who prowls around, looking for </p>
<p>someone to devour” (1 Pet 5:8). </p>
<p>Could Paul have been writing literally? Probably not, since during </p>
<p>Nero’s reign Christians were tortured, burned, and mauled by dogs (Taci-</p>
<p>tus, Ann. 15.44), but not so much eaten by lions. Later, the animal hunts </p>
<p>would include lions.</p>
<p>131</p>
<p> Moreover, Paul as a Roman citizen would be ex-</p>
<p>ecuted, not sent to the coliseum. e lion could represent Nero, because </p>
<p>of his “ferocity,”</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>or his representative, the praefectus praetorii as judge, or</p>
<p>Satan working through Nero. For example, imprisoned Agrippa was told </p>
<p>about Emperor Tiberius, “e lion is dead,” giving Agrippa hope for his </p>
<p>release (Josephus, Ant. 18.6.10 [228]). Tiberius, like a lion, was “quick to </p>
<p>anger and relentless in action . . . It was his bent to turn savage in every case </p>
<p>that he decided; and he inicted the death penalty even for the slightest of-</p>
<p>fences” (Ant. 18 [226–27]). To employ a lion to depict tyrannical rulers has </p>
<p>been a long-standing practice that Paul used to describe how he was saved </p>
<p>at the last moment from death. God, like a shepherd, rescued Paul from the </p>
<p>lion’s mouth (Amos 3:12).</p>
<p>Paul then summarizes: e Lord will rescue me from evil work and </p>
<p>will save me into his heavenly kingdom (4:18a). Alexander did much </p>
<p>evil (kakos) against Paul, but the Lord rescued him from his evil (ponēros) </p>
<p>goals. Evil works are the works of the world against which Jesus testied </p>
<p>(John 7:7). ey are done by God’s enemies (Col 1:21). God rescued Paul </p>
<p>and will rescue him again (4:17–18), but now he emphasizes that God will </p>
<p>save him for his kingdom, the heavenly one, not necessarily his earthly </p>
<p>kingdom (4:18).</p>
<p>133</p>
<p> With this thought about his preservation for the heav-</p>
<p>enly kingdom, Paul, like many a rabbi, breaks out into a blessing: to whom </p>
<p>be the glory forever and ever, amen! (4:18b). In the Pastorals, Paul has </p>
<p>written about glory that is continuous and immeasurable (2:10) and now </p>
<p>passion (Towner 2006: 638–49; Laansma [Belleville 2009]; 214–17).</p>
