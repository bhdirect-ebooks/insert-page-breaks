<p>2 Timothy 2116</p>
<p>aer all, “rejoices in the truth” (1 Cor 13:6), not in falsehood. Such guid-</p>
<p>ance is given not in anger, impatience, or haughtiness, but in gentleness </p>
<p>(prautēs; 2:25). Prautēs is a signicant attribute of Jesus (Matt 11:29), which </p>
<p>signies gentleness, humility, non-contentiousness, goodness, and reliance </p>
<p>on the Lord’s care.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p> is is the way to correct sinners,</p>
<p>126</p>
<p> with a so voice.</p>
<p>127</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A soothing, rm, and so manner might educate and guide those who </p>
<p>persist in placing themselves in opposition</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>to Timothy (2:25). Timothy</p>
<p>educates and guides, but God grants repentance. Divine sovereignty and </p>
<p>human responsibility work cooperatively together. Paul’s opponents: might </p>
<p>become sober again (and escape) from the trap of the devil, captured </p>
<p>alive by him into that will (2:26). Being sober is an important qualica-</p>
<p>tion for an overseer, elder, and minister.</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>ose who are not continually</p>
<p>sober cannot understand the Lord’s will and be lled with the Holy Spirit </p>
<p>(Eph 5:17–18). ey may not even notice that they have been captured alive </p>
<p>by a trap of the devil to do his will (2:26). Paul has used the imagery of a </p>
<p>trap twice in 1 Timothy (3:7; 6:9) to describe a snare that suddenly catches </p>
<p>animals unawares.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>Possibly, the gentleness and patience, the soothing</p>
<p>so voice, the persistence in teaching and guidance is needed with the </p>
<p>opponents because, like trapped animals, their will is limited, their lack </p>
<p>of freedom blinds them from seeing the truth. Even animals trapped in </p>
<p>“Have-a-Heart” cages can become so terried that they do not leave when </p>
<p>the door of the cage is opened.</p>
