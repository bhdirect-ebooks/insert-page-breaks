<p>Titus 250</p>
<p>refers to what a believer is not to do, for example, denying God by one’s </p>
<p>actions (Titus 1:16; 1 Tim 5:8), or denying rather than confessing one’s be-</p>
<p>lief in Jesus (2 Tim 2:12; Matt 10:33). Denying (arneomai) basically refers </p>
<p>to saying “no” (e.g., Matt 26:70). But in Titus 2:12 deny refers to what a </p>
<p>believer should do, as in Jesus’ teaching to deny oneself and take up one’s </p>
<p>cross (Luke 9:23). Believers must say “no” to two synonyms: ungodliness </p>
<p>(asebeia) and alluring passions (Titus 2:12). Ungodliness is the negation </p>
<p>of worship (sebomai).</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> Godless chatter results in godless doctrine and be-</p>
<p>havior (2 Tim 2:16–18). e Lord will judge ungodliness (Rom 1:18; Jude </p>
<p>15). However, since Jesus died for the ungodly (Rom 5:6), no one need </p>
<p>remain in that state.</p>
<p>Kosmeō has positive connotations in Titus 2:10 where the Christian </p>
<p>slave “makes attractive” God’s teachings. However, the adjective (kosmikos; </p>
<p>alluring) has negative connotations in 2:12. Passions (epith<span class="_ _1" />ymia<span class="ff2 ls0 wsd5">) basically </span></p>
<p>refer to strong feelings (thymos) turned “upon” (epi) something.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>In the</p>
<p>New Testament largely the term has negative connotations, except where it </p>
<p>refers to the desire to be with Christ or to be with other believers (Phil 1:23; </p>
<p>1 ess 2:17). But, it can also signify an inward strong feeling that can be </p>
<p>the cause of temptation and sin (Rom 1:24; Jas 1:14–15) if the emotion op-</p>
<p>poses God’s will (1 Pet 4:2; 1 John 2:17). e negative nature of epithymia in </p>
<p>the New Testament is understandable because it is in the same word-family </p>
<p>(epithymeō) used in the tenth commandment, not to “covet” or desire what </p>
<p>belongs to one’s neighbor, whether spouse, property, workers, or animals.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ese desires may appear attractive to the person, but they do not result in </p>
<p>good actions pleasing to Jesus (Titus 2:14).</p>
<p>e opposite of ungodliness and alluring passions are wisdom, and </p>
<p>righteousness, and godliness. Wisdom has already been mentioned as a </p>
<p>positive attribute for male elders (2:2), young women (2:4–5), and young </p>
<p>men (2:6).</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> Righteousness is also a positive attribute for elders.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>A sound</p>
<p>mind (wise) would choose to please God by observing God’s command-</p>
<p>ments (becoming upright), thereby resulting in a worshipful (godly) way </p>
<p>of living (2:12; 1:1).</p>
<p>65. Synonyms of asebeia are unrighteousness and sinfulness (1 Tim 1:9; Rom 1:18; 1 </p>
<p>Pet 4:18; Jude 15).</p>
