<p>Timothy Should Not Be Ashamed to Suer (1:3—2:13)</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>starting from</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>eternal times refers to God’s continuous, immeasurable</p>
<p>time as opposed to human specic time.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>In other words, before human</p>
<p>time ever existed, God’s power had a holy calling for humans in Christ Je-</p>
<p>sus, according to God’s purpose and grace. at calling is a “godly life in </p>
<p>Christ Jesus” (3:12), or a calling to be holy (1:9).</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>Ephesians also describes</p>
<p>this calling as “for good actions, which God prepared beforehand, that in </p>
<p>them we might walk” (2:10), or God chose humans “to be holy and blame-</p>
<p>less before him in love” (1:4), in contrast to such actions as “godless vain </p>
<p>talking” and succumbing to “youthful passions” (2 Tim 2:16, 22). e sec-</p>
<p>ond action refers to the incarnation (the appearing of our Savior Christ </p>
<p>Jesus), which highlights Jesus, the Messiah, the Savior, the deliverer, who </p>
<p>gave his life as a ransom for many.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>Later, Paul will repeat: faith in Christ</p>
<p>Jesus brings salvation (2 Tim 3:15). Elsewhere, Paul uses the appearing </p>
<p>(epiphaneia) to refer to Jesus’ return to earth for judgment,</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>however, in 2</p>
<p>Timothy 1:10 Paul refers to the incarnation by using the past tense (having </p>
<p>been revealed), indicating this “appearing” has already occurred, similar </p>
<p>to Titus 2:11 and 3:4,</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>where Jesus is the embodiment of God’s grace and</p>
<p>salvation.</p>
<p>e third action is having abolished death (1:10). e fourth, and </p>
<p>nal, action is having brought to light life and immortality through the </p>
<p>gospel (1:10). Abolish might be more exactly rendered “making of no ef-</p>
<p>fect.” Christ Jesus deprived death of its strength, power, force, and inu-</p>
<p>ence. Death is now unemployed and inactive and inoperative.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>Christ’s</p>
<p>resurrection or life demonstrated God’s victory over death (see also 2:8). </p>
<p>Christ also nullied the power of death by having entered its domain. </p>
<p>Rather than having been overwhelmed by it, he returned from death, not </p>
<p>spreading darkness and death, but rather bringing to the light life and im-</p>
<p>mortality.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>Death has not yet been literally abolished. e state of having</p>
<p>to be enslaved to sin has been abolished (Rom 6:6; 7:6). Death separating </p>
