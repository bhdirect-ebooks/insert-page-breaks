<p>Titus 364</p>
<p>were to receive the inheritance. God was the One who promised the in-</p>
<p>heritance, but Abraham had to trust the Lord.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>God is still the One who</p>
<p>promises inheritances (Titus 1:2). But God’s inheritance is not earthly; as </p>
<p>a matter of fact, earthly possessions can make it harder for the believer to </p>
<p>inherit.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>Only the humble will inherit (Matt 5:5; Titus 3:2). e inheritance</p>
<p>is eternal life, which begins now, but continues forever.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> It is God’s “imper-</p>
<p>ishable and undeled and unfading” inheritance kept safely in heaven for </p>
<p>the nal resurrection (1 Cor 15:50–54; 1 Pet 1:4). However, the wicked do </p>
<p>not inherit God’s kingdom, but only the sanctied, those who “overcome.”</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>How might this promise be received by the ancient Cretans? Paul else-</p>
<p>where has promised that Abraham’s ospring, the heirs of God’s promised </p>
<p>kingdom, are Jew and Greek, foreigner and citizen, slave and free, male and </p>
<p>female (Gal 3:28–29; Col 3:11). What might strike an original reader is that </p>
<p>the promise of becoming heirs is for all people and for all time. Ancient </p>
<p>Crete had numerous social classes. e ruling citizen class (a minority), </p>
<p>of course, had the landed wealth. e household owned the family estate </p>
<p>(klēros). ere were free people who owned property and free people with-</p>
<p>out political rights. e resident aliens had to live in special quarters of the </p>
<p>city. e serfs originally did not own houses on the estate, but eventually </p>
<p>they might inherit if the free citizens had no living relatives.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> Slaves nor-</p>
<p>mally were not heirs.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>ey were part of the inheritance! But, they could</p>
<p>be set free and adopted as heirs.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> Women and non-citizens had no politi-</p>
<p>cal rights. In Athens, a daughter could inherit when she had no brothers, </p>
<p>similar to the Hebrew practice.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>In Crete, daughters did inherit but smaller</p>
<p>portions than the brothers. Daughters who were sole heirs had to marry </p>
<p>next of kin.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> Paul had described all believers as formerly slaves.</p>
