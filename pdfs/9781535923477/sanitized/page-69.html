<p>Fusing the Horizons: e Importance of Holiness</p>

<p>name of Christ through the mud. Alluding to Isaiah 52:5, he wrote: “The Lord </p>
<p>says, ‘My name is continually blasphemed among all the nations,’ . . . Why </p>
<p>is it blasphemed? Because you do not do what I desire. For when the pagans </p>
<p>hear from our mouths the oracles of God, they marvel at their beauty and </p>
<p>greatness. But when they discover that our actions are not worthy of the words </p>
<p>we speak, they turn from wonder to blasphemy, saying that it is a myth and a </p>
<p>delusion” (2 Clem. 13:2–3). Sadly, today the church is not that different.</p>

<p>When my husband and I applied for our ﬁrst calls after completing seminary, </p>
<p>we discovered that the male chaplains that preceded us at both colleges had </p>
<p>had sexual liaisons with female students. One secular institution was so upset, </p>
<p>it was about to prohibit the Christian ministries board from sending any more </p>
<p>Protestant chaplains. The only way the ministries board was able to send an-</p>
<p>other chaplain was by sending them a female, which in this case was myself. </p>
<p>Being a female in itself was not the key, but being a female who was intent on </p>
<p>demonstrating her faith in her lifestyle was. We preserved our witness at this </p>
<p>institution, but how much irreparable harm was done previously? What did </p>
<p>others think of religious persons abusing their authority? What happened to </p>
<p>the women who were sexually abused? Did they ever forgive God? What about </p>
<p>the chaplains’ wives and children? Did they blame God? What about all the </p>
<p>people who heard about these sins? Have they come to understand what true </p>
<p>Christianity is all about? This is where Paul’s Letter to Titus is so helpful. As a </p>
<p>wise mentor, Paul is counseling Titus to clarify the place of good deeds in the </p>
<p>lives of those who have received God’s grace. Actions express one’s genuine </p>
<p>beliefs, educate others, reﬂect God’s purposes for our lives and help others, </p>
<p>as well as oneself.</p>
<p>In both the old and the new covenants, God desires holy behavior. The </p>
<p>behavior, in itself, does not save us, but good behavior has its positive role to </p>
<p>play. </p>

<p>99. While showing that many Christians are living “just like the rest of the world,” </p>
<p>Sider (and others) demonstrate that people with a “biblical worldview demonstrate </p>
<p>genuinely dierent behavior” than others (2005: 128).</p>
