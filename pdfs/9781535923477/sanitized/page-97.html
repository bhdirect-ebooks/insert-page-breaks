<p>Timothy Should Not Be Ashamed to Suer (1:3—2:13)</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>the same way, as faith dwelled in Paul’s parents and grandparents when </p>
<p>they worshiped the God revealed in the Old Testament, so too faith dwelled </p>
<p>in Timothy’s grandmother Lois and mother Eunice when they worshiped </p>
<p>the same God in the New Testament times. Moses commanded the He-</p>
<p>brews to read the law to all the men, women, children, and foreigners living </p>
<p>in the cities every seventh year so they could listen and learn to fear the </p>
<p>Lord and follow carefully the law (Deut 31:10–13). In many places in the </p>
<p>Old Testament, parents are exhorted to teach their children about God’s </p>
<p>great deeds.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> God’s words are to be remembered: “Teach them to your chil-</p>
<p>dren, talking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along </p>
<p>the road, when you lie down and when you get up” (Deut 11:19; TNIV).</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Godly instruction should come from the father and mother (Prov 1:8), but </p>
<p>Timothy’s father was a Gentile and thus did not undertake Timothy’s bib-</p>
<p>lical training (Acts 16:1). Even some Romans esteemed the education of </p>
<p>“the good old days” when mothers (not servants) trained their children, as </p>
<p>did Cornelia, the mother of Sempronius and Tiberius Gracchus, Aurelia </p>
<p>mother of Caesar, Atia of Augustus, so that the child might “lay hold with </p>
<p>heart and soul on virtuous accomplishments” (Dial. 28). While the Roman </p>
<p>focus might be more on an occupation such as “the army, or the law, or the </p>
<p>pursuit of eloquence,”</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> a devout Jew would instead focus on God’s revela-</p>
<p>tion. Timothy learned the holy Scriptures from infancy from his mother </p>
<p>and grandmother (2 Tim 3:15). Timothy and at least also Eunice became </p>
<p>believers in Jesus as the Messiah in Lystra (Acts 16:1).</p>
<p>God’s Gi (1:6–7)</p>
<p>Paul then returns to his earlier point: I am persuaded (a genuine faith) </p>
<p>dwells also in you (1:5). Yet, though genuine faith dwells within Timo-</p>
<p>thy, as it did in his mother and grandmother, he needs to act more: For </p>
<p>this reason I remind you to keep stirring into ame God’s gi, which </p>
<p>is in you through the laying on of my hands (1:6). Paul has remembered </p>
<p>(mneia) Timothy in his prayers, remembered (mimnēskomai) Timothy’s </p>
<p>the sanctuary of God wherein dwells God’s Spirit (1 Cor 3:16; 2 Cor 6:16). Oikeō is used </p>
<p>literally in 1 Cor 7:12–13 to describe a husband and wife living together in the same </p>
<p>household. e aorist tense suggests dwelling had a beginning (Towner 2006: 454).</p>
<p>23. Passover—Exod 13:8–16; Mount Horeb—Deut 4:9–14; nature of God—Deut </p>
<p>6:4–9.</p>
<p>24. See also Ps 78:4–7; Prov 22:6; Joel 1:2–3.</p>
<p>25. Although goodness and self-control are also mentioned by Tacitus (Dial. 29).</p>
