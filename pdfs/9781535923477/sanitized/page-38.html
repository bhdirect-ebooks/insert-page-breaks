<p>Titus 124</p>
<p>refers to stopping up or bridling the mouth, a punishment.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>Varus, the ruler of Syria, “punished” or “silenced” some Jews who had re-</p>
<p>volted against Caesar.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>Likewise, one of the functions of the elders was to</p>
<p>reprove opposition (Titus 1:9, 13).</p>
<p>Paul then cites a Cretan as support against the wrong teachings in </p>
<p>Crete: Someone said from out of their own, a prophet from among them: </p>
<p>Cretans always are liars, evil beasts, idle bellies. is testimony is true </p>
<p>(1: 12–13a). Clement of Alexandria (AD 150–212) cites Epimenides’ poem </p>
<p>Peri Chrēsmoi in Oracula as the source of the quotation (Strom. 1.14.59). </p>
<p>Epimenides, son of Phaestius, who lived 600–500 BC, born in Knossos, </p>
<p>Crete, was a legendary seer who was said to have lived 157 or 299 years (Di-</p>
<p>ogenes Laertius 1.10.109, 111). Cicero cites him as an illustration of those </p>
<p>who prophesy while in a frenzy (Div. 1.18.34). Ancient writers give him </p>
<p>credit, because he had “superhuman foresight,” for a number of miraculous </p>
<p>acts, such as stopping pestilence in Athens. Even some Cretans sacriced to </p>
<p>him as a god.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>If indeed Paul is quoting Epimenides, Paul is simply saying</p>
<p>that his testimony about the general nature of Cretans (in ancient times) </p>
<p>was true and applicable in this case (Titus 1:13).</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e rst three words of Paul’s quotation are cited by Callimachus of </p>
<p>Cyrene (circa 310 BC), an epic poet and contemporary of Ptolemy Phila-</p>
<p>delphus, Cretans always are liars (Hymn. Jov. line 8). is idea was so </p>
<p>proverbial in ancient times that the Greek krētizō, “to play the Cretan,” for </p>
<p>many meant simply “to lie.”</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>Even though some ancients might agree with</p>
<p>the Cretan myth that many gods had their origin in Crete (Diodorus 5.46. </p>
<p>3), many did not appreciate the Cretan version that Zeus was buried in a </p>
<p>tomb in Crete. Callimachus doubts that Zeus was born in Crete rather than </p>
<p>Arcadia because the Cretans are known for their lying. He especially doubts </p>
<p>their legend that Zeus was buried in Crete because Zeus is “forever” (line </p>
<p>9). Lucian cites Cretans as an illustration of “cities and whole peoples” who </p>
<p>tell lies “unanimously and ocially”: “e Cretans exhibit the tomb of Zeus </p>

<p>81. In Romans, Paul asserts that all humans can learn about God from creation </p>
<p>(1:19–21). Even Jesus’ adversary, the high priest Caiaphas, could prophesy accurately </p>
<p>about Jesus’ substitutionary death (John 11:49–53). us, even nonbelievers can observe </p>
<p>truths about Jesus. Christ “enlightens everyone” (John 1:9).</p>
