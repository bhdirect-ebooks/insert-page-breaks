<p>Titus 130</p>
<p>demonstrated his interest in “shameful gain” (Titus 1:11; Acts 8:18–20), </p>
<p>was considered by Irenaeus the person “from whom all heresies got their </p>
<p>s t a r t .”</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>Holding to elements of reincarnation, docetism, and syncretism</p>
<p>(Haer. 1.23.2, 4), Simon saw himself as “Father on high” who gave birth </p>
<p>to “ought” (Helen), who gave birth to Angels and Powers, who kept her </p>
<p>from returning to her “Father on high” (Haer. 1.23.2). According to Ire-</p>
<p>naeus, the “mystic priests of these people live licentious lives and practice </p>
<p>magic” (Haer. 1.23.4). Cerinthus, unlike Simon, appeared to be Jewish and </p>
<p>was “enslaved to lusts and pleasure” (Euseb. Hist. eccl. 3.28 [2]; 7.25 [3]). He </p>
<p>thought the world was not created by the rst God, thereby appearing to </p>
<p>treat matter as evil (Irenaeus, Haer. 1.26.1; cf. 1 Tim 4:3–5). Jesus died, but </p>
<p>not “Christ” (Haer. 1.26.1). us, the Simonians might illustrate the focus </p>
<p>on genealogies, and Cerinthians a low view of matter, but neither illustrated </p>
<p>the Jewish quarrels about the law.</p>
<p>Minds and Consciences Are Deled (1:15–16)</p>
<p>ese teachers who claim to know God were seeing things that were clean </p>
<p>or pure and treating them as unclean or impure because their own minds </p>
<p>and consciences were soiled: All things are pure to the pure ones; but to </p>
<p>the deled and unbelieving nothing is pure, but also their mind and </p>
<p>conscience are deled. ey profess to know God, but they are deny-</p>
<p>ing his works, being abominable and disobedient and unacceptable for </p>
<p>every good work (1:15–16). Paul uses imagery from the Old Testament </p>
<p>sacricial system, as Hebrews explains: “e law requires that nearly ev-</p>
<p>erything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there </p>
<p>is no forgiveness” (Heb 9:22; TNIV). Katharos, -a, -on, katharizō (pure) </p>
<p>can refer to “clear” or “clean,”</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>but it also refers to ritual purity, such as</p>
<p>a puried cup (Matt 23:25–26), or “clean” food,</p>
<p>112</p>
<p> or a body free of lep-</p>
<p>rosy.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p> e opposite is deled.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>e circumcision party (Titus 1:10)</p>
<p>would be concerned for ritual purity, which would be met by such things </p>
<p>110. Haer. 1.23.2. Yamauchi concludes that there is “unanimous testimony” among </p>
the Church Fathers “that Simon is the rst individual who was designated a Gnostic, and
<p>that Simonianism is the earliest form of Gnosticism recognized by the patristic sources” </p>
<p>(1973: 59–60).</p>
<p>111. E.g., Rev 21:18, 21; Matt 27:59, gold or linen.</p>
<p>112. Acts 10:15; Mark 7:19; Rom 14:20.</p>
<p>113. Matt 8:2; 10:8; 11:5.</p>
<p>114. Miainō, e.g., John 18:28.</p>
