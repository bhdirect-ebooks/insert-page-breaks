<p>Titus 368</p>
<p>himself reject these people</p>
<p>77</p>
: A divisive person, aer one and a second
<p>admonition, reject, knowing that such a person is completely turned </p>
<p>away and sins, being self-condemned (3:10–11). Eusebius cites Titus 3:10 </p>
<p>word-for-word as a basis for Polycarp not acknowledging Marcion’s teach-</p>
<p>ings as orthodox and for the apostles and their disciples not “even to join in </p>
<p>conversation with any of those who mutilate the truth” (Hist. eccl. 4.14.7). </p>
<p>Paul describes someone who pushes people to choose sides in arguments </p>
<p>that will not be edifying.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On what two bases can Titus reject such people? ey are completely </p>
<p>turned away (ekstrephō) and they sin (3:11). Ekstrephō metaphorically can </p>
<p>have positive or negative connotations. For example, Jesus challenges his </p>
<p>adult disciples to turn back and become like children (Matt 18:3). Stephen </p>
<p>describes his ancestors as having “turned back” to Egypt when they asked </p>
<p>for the Egyptian gods (Acts 7:39). Since the perfect tense presents a “com-</p>
<p>pleted state or condition,”</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>sometimes in the past these people turned away</p>
<p>from the truth and have remained in this state. ey are similar to those in </p>
<p>Moses’ time who had turned from the living God to worship foreign gods. </p>
<p>ey are “twisted.”</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>(But Titus still had to warn them.) In the end, they</p>
<p>condemn themselves by their choosing not to change.</p>
<p>Conclusion (3:12–15)</p>
<p>With these words, Paul concludes the body of his letter and moves now </p>
<p>to concluding directions to Titus. Paul wants Titus to come to him and, </p>
<p>by helping Zenas and Apollos, teach people to devote themselves to good </p>
<p>works (3:12–15). </p>
<p>Titus, Come (3:12)</p>
<p>Paul has le Titus behind in Crete to complete their work (1:5). Soon Paul </p>
<p>will enable Titus to join him at Nicopolis in Greece by sending a coworker </p>
<p>to take his place: Whenever I will send Artemas to you or Tychicus, make </p>
<p>every eort to come to me into Nicopolis, for there I decided to spend </p>
<p>77. See 1 Tim 4:7; 5:11 (Spencer 2013); 2 Tim 2:23; Heb 12:25. </p>
