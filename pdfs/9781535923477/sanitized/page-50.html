<p>Titus 236</p>
<p>Qualities for elders/overseers are evident throughout Titus 2:2–10: </p>
<p>self-controlled limiting of consumption of intoxicating substances (elders), </p>
<p>honor, wisdom (male elders, young women and men), faithfulness (male </p>
<p>elders and slaves), love (male elders and young women), perseverance, ho-</p>
<p>liness (female elders and young women), ability to teach (female elders), </p>
<p>household-oriented, not being self-pleasing, not being disobedient, and </p>
<p>not seeking selsh nancial gain. Yet the male and female elders have dis-</p>
<p>tinctive aspects of their Christian walk to which they had to pay attention. </p>
<p>Only women in these lists are challenged not to be slanderous (Titus 2:3; 1 </p>
<p>Tim 3:11). </p>
<p>Paul highlights six qualities important for the male elder: to be sober, </p>
<p>honorable, wise, healthy in faith, in love, in perseverance (2:2). A recur-</p>
<p>ring topic at Crete and Ephesus is the necessity not to become intoxicated, </p>
<p>but rather to remain sober.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>If one is sober, then the second quality is more</p>
<p>likely—to be honorable or godly. Semnos has been translated by such di-</p>
<p>verse terms as “honorable, serious, dignied, and holy.”</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>It describes the</p>
<p>ideal minister/deacon (male and female, 1 Tim 3:8, 11), children (1 Tim </p>
<p>3:4), male elder (Titus 2:2), teaching (Titus 2:7), and all Christians (1 Tim </p>
<p>2:2). e noun, like its verb form (sebō)</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>properly refers to God or the</p>
<p>gods.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>us, semnos can refer to the feeling of awe or reverence before God.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, semnos is always used in a positive sense. Luke uses </p>
<p>it in Acts to describe the Gentile converts to Judaism, such as Lydia (16:14) </p>
<p>and Titius Justus (18:7), the “God-fearers” (13:43; 17:4, 17), and to the re-</p>
<p>spectable, august, or honorable women of Pisidian Antioch (13:50). us, </p>
<p>semnos appears to be an aspect of God that humans should have. More than </p>
<p>“serious,” it is “august.” It is a synonym for “godliness” (1 Tim 2:2) and “un-</p>
<p>corrupted” (Titus 2:7). We are to think of whatever is honorable or godly or </p>
<p>awesome (Phil 4:8) so that we can become honorable, godly, and awesome </p>
<p>ourselves. is is true for all Christians, and certainly Christian leaders.</p>
<p>Wisdom permeates every aspect of leadership. Even though it is </p>
<p>twelh on the list for an elder in Titus as opposed to fourth on the list for </p>
<p>11. See discussion on “sober” in Titus 1:7 and 1 Tim 3:2–3 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>12. Phil 4:8, “honorable” (NRSV); Titus 2:7, “seriousness” (NIV); Titus 2:2, “serious” </p>
<p>(NRSV); 1 Tim 2:2, “dignity” (NRSV) and “holiness” (NIV).</p>
<p>13. LSJ, 1591; ayer, 573.</p>
<p>14. E.g., Acts 18:13; Matt 15:9; Acts 19:27 Artemis; Aristotle, Rhet. II.xxiii.12 “awe-</p>
<p>some goddesses.”</p>
