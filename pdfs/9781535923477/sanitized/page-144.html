<p>2 Timothy 3130</p>
<p>Scriptures gives guidance toward the end goal of salvation. Moreover, the </p>
<p>Scriptures must be studied through the lens of faith in Christ Jesus, which </p>
<p>helps the Scriptures be handled rightly (2:15).</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>Paul then further denes Scripture: All Scripture is God-breathed </p>
<p>and advantageous for teaching, for reproof, for restoration, for guidance, </p>
<p>the one in righteousness, in order that God’s person may be complete, </p>
<p>being completed fully for every good work (3:16–17). Paul highlights two </p>
<p>key characteristics of Scripture: from whom does it originate and for what </p>
<p>purposes is it helpful. e foundational truth is that it is God-breathed. In </p>
<p>3:15, he uses the plural “writings,” while in 3:16 the singular “writing.”</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> Ev-</p>
<p>ery single one of the “holy writings” is God-breathed (3:16). God-breathed </p>
<p>is a composite of two words: “God” and to “breathe forth” (pneō).</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>Pneō</p>
<p>is oen used literally of winds that blow, such as winds that blow down a </p>
<p>house or a ship.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>e Holy Spirit is analogous to the wind that “blows</p>
<p>wherever it pleases” (John 3:8). e Spirit creates and keeps humans and </p>
<p>animals alive.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>Similar to breathing the breath of life into a mass of dirt</p>
<p>and making Adam alive (Gen 2:7), God has blown life into the Scriptures. </p>
<p>ey are created by God and, therefore, are inspired by God. Human beings </p>
<p>who received God’s revelation mainly through prophets,</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>now have heard</p>
<p>God-incarnate’s message</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>recorded in God-breathed writings, true to his</p>
<p>original message, and, as God-breathed, standing forever (Isa 40:8).</p>
<p>erefore, they are useful for four goals: teaching, reproof, restora-</p>
<p>tion, guidance (3:16). Teaching (didaskalia) and learning are crucial con-</p>
<p>cerns in Ephesus.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p> Scriptures cause the reader to learn.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>ey also reprove,</p>
<p>bringing deeds and thoughts out in the open for clarity and truth.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> Read-</p>
<p>96. e Scriptures also prophesy about Jesus (Luke 24:27, 44; Acts 17:2–3; 18:28; </p>
<p>Rom 1:2; 16:25–26; 1 Cor 15:3–4).</p>
<p>97. Gramma (3:15) and graphē (3:16) both come from the verb graphō, “to write” </p>
<p>(ayer, 120–21).</p>
<p>98. LSJ, 1425.</p>
<p>99. Matt 7:25, 27; John 6:18.</p>
<p>100. Ps 103:29–30; LXX. Poirier (2010: 92) agrees: theopne<span class="_ _2" />ustos is “life-giving,” but </p>
<p>Scripture not only “contains” the life-giving gospel, all of it is life-giving.</p>
<p>101. 2 Sam 23:2; Jer 1:9; Ezek 3:4; 13:1; 2 Chr 18:13. God’s Spirit gives prophetic </p>
<p>authority in Scripture (Yarchin 2012: 363–81).</p>
<p>102. John 3:33–34; 1 Cor 2:10; Gal 1:11–17; 1 ess 2:13; Rev 21:5; 22:6.</p>
