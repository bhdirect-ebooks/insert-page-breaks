<p>Titus 238</p>
<p>since God is truth and love, love is necessary to work together with faith. </p>
<p>Now, as well, the elder needs to persevere in faith and love with a constancy </p>
<p>that persists through testing, cares, riches, pleasures, and persecution (Luke </p>
<p>8:13–15; 21:12–19).</p>
<p>e list for the female elders is connected with the list for the male </p>
<p>elders by “likewise”: (encourage) elders (females), likewise, to be in de-</p>
<p>meanor holy, not slanderous, and not enslaved to much wine, teaching </p>
<p>what is good (2:3). us, although Paul highlights distinctive qualities </p>
<p>for each, yet their function as elders is similar. In 1 Timothy the likewise </p>
<p>indicates that the women are to pray as the men (2:8–9), the ministers/</p>
<p>deacons need leadership qualities similar to the overseer’s (3:8), and the </p>
<p>female ministers/deacons need leadership qualities similar to those of the </p>
<p>male ministers/deacons (3:11). e likewise also indicates that Titus is to </p>
<p>encourage the female elders as much as he does the male elders.</p>
<p>Paul places the prepositional phrase in demeanor rst (2:3), therefore </p>
<p>highlighting it. Katastēma, occurring only here in the Bible, refers to an </p>
<p>external bodily or mental state.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>For instance, some elephants were driven</p>
<p>to a maniacal state by external inducements (3 Macc 5:45). Or, Alexandra, </p>
<p>mother of Queen Mariamne, wife of King Herod, changed her behavior </p>
<p>from boldly supportive of her daughter to critical of her (Josephus, Ant. </p>
<p>15.7 [232–34]). But Paul does not advise the women elders to display criti-</p>
<p>cism or a maniacal state—rather a steady behavior of holiness.</p>
<p>e neuter form, hieron, is always used in the New Testament literally </p>
<p>for the temple in Jerusalem (e.g., Matt 21:23). If indeed all believers are </p>
<p>members of God’s “holy priesthood,”</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>then certainly women elders also</p>
<p>need to act appropriately to a priestly vocation, in other words, in a holy or </p>
<p>reverent manner. Hieroprepēs signies “appropriate to a sacred place.” It is a </p>
<p>synonym for semnos (Titus 2:2).</p>
<p>e opposite of a holy demeanor, which is eshed out in teaching </p>
<p>what is good (2:3), is being slanderous (diabolos) and enslaved to much </p>
<p>wine. Normally diabolos (with the article) refers to the devil. Jesus told </p>
<p>some religious leaders that the devil “was a murderer from the beginning </p>
<p>and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he </p>
<p>lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father </p>
<p>of lies” (John 8:44; NRSV). In Ephesians, the devil’s schemes work against </p>
<p>20. LSJ, 914.</p>
