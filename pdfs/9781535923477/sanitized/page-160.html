<p>2 Timothy 4146</p>
<p>Paul then asks Timothy: Having picked him up, bring Mark with </p>
<p>yourself, for he is useful to me for ministry (4:11b). Mark must be some-</p>
<p>where near Ephesus, on the way to where Timothy will board a ship at </p>
<p>Troas (4:13).</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>In this sentence, we are reminded that Paul and John Mark</p>
<p>are now reconciled to each other. John Mark as a youth was reared in the </p>
<p>Christian church. His mother, Mary, hosted the Jerusalem church in their </p>
<p>home. Mark joined Paul and Barnabas on their rst traveling outreach </p>
<p>(Acts 12:25), but he deserted them in Perga in Pamphylia, thereby causing </p>
<p>Paul not to want to take him on the second trip. Mark’s cousin Barnabas </p>
<p>advocated for him (Acts 13:13; 15:37–40). By the time Paul is rst impris-</p>
<p>oned in Rome (c. AD 59–62), Mark remains steadfastly with Paul as his co-</p>
<p>worker (Col 4:10; Phlm 24).</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>Mark became a consecrated “vessel,” “useful”</p>
<p>to the “master” (2 Tim 2:21) and useful for ministry (4:11), like Onesimus </p>
<p>(though once not “useful” was now “useful”</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>), though we cannot be sure </p>
<p>exactly how Mark would be useful to Paul for ministry. Zahn suggests that </p>
<p>Mark possessed “a treasure of narratives from the lips of Peter and of other </p>
<p>disciples of Jesus, who were accustomed to come and go to his mother’s </p>
<p>h o u s e .”</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>Possibly, Mark might help in Paul’s writing projects (4:13). Mark</p>
<p>is also well acquainted with Rome and with the condition of the church </p>
<p>90. Possibly he was still in or near Colosse (Col 4:10). </p>
<p>91. Mark was also friends with the Apostle Peter. Mark’s and Peter’s friendship goes </p>
<p>back to at least the early 30s, when Peter arrives to celebrate his release from prison (Acts </p>
<p>12:12). Among experiences Mark and Peter had in common were that even as believers </p>
<p>they denied their faith not just once but at least twice. Mark may have been present (the </p>
<p>“certain young man”) when Jesus was arrested, and, when they tried to arrest him too, </p>
<p>ran away naked (Mark 14:51–52. See also Barclay 1966: 157; Zahn 1953: 2:428, 447). </p>
<p>Strong and consistent early traditions support a connection between Peter and Mark </p>
<p>in the writing of Mark’s Gospel (e.g., Eusebius, Hist. eccl. 2.15; 3.39; 5.8; 6.14, 25). Both </p>
<p>Peter and Mark, in times of testing, failed in discipleship, but they were able to turn their </p>
<p>lives around and become victorious Christians. Mark is remembered for traveling to </p>
<p>Egypt and establishing churches in Alexandria (Eusebius, Hist. eccl. 2.16, 24; Zahn 1953: </p>
<p>2:431, 448; Baring-Gould 1898: 4:334).</p>
<p>92. Phlm 11; 1 Pet 5:13; Spencer 2007: 270–71; Lock 1924: 117.</p>
<p>93. Zahn 1953: 2:430; 377–79, 445–47, 451.</p>
