<p>Titus 370</p>
<p> Coworker Artemas is nowhere else mentioned in the Bible.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> Tychi-</p>
<p>cus (literally, “fortuitous”)</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>was originally from Asia and has accompanied</p>
<p>Paul as a coworker since the late 50s until just before Paul’s death in the </p>
<p>late 60s. He accompanied Paul and others with the donation for the poor </p>
<p>Christians in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>ey traveled together from Greece to Asia to</p>
<p>Syria. He was with Paul in Rome during both the rst and second impris-</p>
<p>onments.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>Paul sends him twice to Ephesus, once to Colosse, and now to</p>
<p>Crete. He may have carried the letters to the Ephesians and the Colossians. </p>
<p>Paul describes his role and mission in Ephesians and Colossians in almost </p>
<p>the same words: “the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord.”</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although “brother(s)” and “sister(s)” are common ways for the early </p>
<p>Christians to indicate their close relationship, Tychicus and Onesimus are </p>
the only individuals called “beloved brother.” Tychicus is a reliable minis-
<p>ter</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>with a special gi. He was sent to the churches in Asia so that they</p>
<p>would know “the things” concerning Paul and his coworkers in Rome and, </p>
<p>thereby, have their “hearts” encouraged.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>“e things concerning us” (ta</p>
<p>peri hēmōn) is an important phrase for Paul. For example, in Philippians, </p>
<p>followers of Christ should show their interest in Christ by showing interest </p>
<p>in one another because all believers are members of Christ’s body.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>is agapē love. By “encouraging their hearts,” Tychicus would support the </p>
<p>Christians in Crete.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>Tychicus seems to have the gi of encouragement</p>
<p>(Rom 12:8), a helpful role to follow Titus’ previous organizational eorts. </p>
<p>Teach People to Keep Busy in Good Works (3:13–14)</p>
<p>Paul will send Artemas or Tychicus to Titus and Paul, in turn, wants Titus </p>
<p>to send Zenas and Apollos: Zenas the lawyer and Apollos—diligently </p>
<p>send on their way, that nothing may lack to them (3:13). Zenas and </p>
<p>90. Artemas is later called one of the Seventy and bishop of Lystra (Lock 1924: 158; </p>
<p>Bernard 1922: 182).</p>
