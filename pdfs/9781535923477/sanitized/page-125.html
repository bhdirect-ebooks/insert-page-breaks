<p>must stand away from unrighteousness (2:19). Paul appears to allude to </p>
<p>the Old Testament incident wherein Korah and 250 chiefs insist they could </p>
<p>oer sacrices in the tabernacle as did Aaron and his sons. At that time, </p>
<p>Moses told Korah and his followers that God has known the ones who are </p>
<p>his, who are the “holy ones,” set apart, chosen as priests (Num 16:5). en </p>
<p>Moses exhorted the rest of the Hebrews to separate themselves from the </p>
<p>people who had questioned whether the Lord had sent Moses and Aaron, </p>
<p>so as to avoid falling into the earth when it opened up in judgment: literally, </p>
<p>they had to “stand o away from” (aphistēmi) the tent of Korah and the oth-</p>
<p>ers if they wanted to stay alive (Num 15:27). Paul’s allusion to this incident </p>
<p>shows that the heresy of Hymenaeus and Philetus was a dangerous one that </p>
<p>would result in condemnation for any attracted to it.</p>
<p>Unrighteousness implies immoral behavior because Paul now pro-</p>
<p>poses in a positive manner its opposite, righteousness</p>

<p>: But in a great </p>
<p>household there are not only golden and silver vessels but also wooden </p>
<p>and clay, and, on the one hand, some are into honor, but, on the other </p>
<p>hand, some are into dishonor; therefore, if some might purify them-</p>
<p>selves from these things, (s)he will be a vessel into honor, consecrated, </p>
<p>useful to the master, prepared for every good work (2:20–21). In contrast </p>
<p>to battling about words, which is “useful for nothing” (chrēsimos; 2:14), </p>
<p>Timothy and the church are to make themselves useful</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>(of good service)</p>
<p>to the master (2:21). Paul uses an extended illustration, comparing people </p>
<p>(household servants) with dierent types of vessels (skeuos). is is a large </p>
<p>household with many dierent vessels. A vessel is moveable property, any </p>
<p>item that can be carried.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>It includes the moveable items in the temple</p>
<p>(Num 1:50; Heb 9:21). us, if Christians as a group are God’s sanctuary </p>
(e.g., 1 Cor 6:19–20), individually they are vessels in the sanctuary. Whereas
<p>in Romans 9:21–23 the focus is on the potter and the malleability of the clay, </p>
<p>in 2 Timothy 2:20–21 the focus is on the pot and human responsibility.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 1 essalonians 4:4, the vessel symbolizes the human body, and one’s </p>
<p>97. See Titus 3:6.</p>
<p>98. e use of euchrēstos in 2:21 adds eu- (good) to chrēstos which heightens its </p>
<p>positive value. Chrēstos is a characteristic of God, God as forgiving, bringing health and </p>
<p>wholesomeness. See Titus 3:4; TLNT 3:511–16. </p>
<p>99. E.g., Gen 31:37; 45:20; Exod 30:27; Matt 12:29; Luke 17:31; Rev 18:12.</p>
<p>100. Vessel is a term the Lord used for Paul himself: “a chosen vessel to carry my </p>
<p>name” (Acts 9:15). In 2 Cor 4:7, the focus is on an unimpressive jar that hides a treasure </p>
<p>inside. e vessel is a life of diculties of a genuine Christian worker (4:8–10). In 1 Pet </p>
<p>3:7, the vessel symbolizes the human body, its physical strength.</p>
