<p>Good Soldier of Christ Jesus (2:3–7)</p>

<p>Good Soldier of Christ Jesus (2:3–7)</p>
<p>Paul now has the third command to Timothy in the concluding part (2:1–</p>
<p>13) of the rst section of the letter (1:3–2:13): “Keep on being empowered” </p>
<p>(2:1) and “entrust” (2:2). Now, he adds, join in suering (2:3), returning to </p>
<p>his earlier command (1:8), but modifying in what manner Timothy should </p>
<p>join in suering: he should do it as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. Fighting </p>
<p>as a soldier has been a predominate image that Paul has used for Timothy.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Timothy is exhorted to be a good soldier under his commander who is </p>
<p>Christ Jesus. His commander determines the campaign and weapons he </p>
<p>uses: Timothy serves in a “good” campaign with weapons of “faith and a </p>
<p>good conscience.”</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> How does the image of being a soldier relate to suer-</p>
<p>ing? A soldier has to endure diculties. For instance, the Roman soldier </p>
<p>might have to carry eighty pounds on an all-day march and then construct </p>
<p>defenses at the end of the day.</p>
<p>19</p>
But, soldiers did not work as individuals,
<p>but in companies.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>at is why Paul calls Timothy to join in suering. He</p>
<p>does not endure diculties alone.</p>
<p>A good soldier is further described: No one serving as a soldier en-</p>
<p>twines himself in aairs of life, so that he might meet the needs of the </p>
<p>one having enlisted him (2:4). Following the orders of one’s commanding </p>
<p>ocer is crucial. e centurion in Capernaum described his way of life: </p>
<p>“For I myself am a person under authority, having under me soldiers, and I </p>
<p>say to this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes, and </p>
<p>to my slave, ‘Do this,’ and he does it” (Luke 7:8). Oen soldiers volunteered </p>
<p>because they were attracted to the general’s personality and reputation and </p>
<p>felt their allegiance to him rather than to the State.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Soldiers were recruited</p>
<p>by a commander to participate in that commander’s campaign. erefore, </p>
<p>the good soldier would aim to meet the needs of, or please, that command-</p>
<p>er. ey were not even allowed to marry until their term of service was </p>
<p>17. See 1 Tim 6:12 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>18. See 1 Tim 1:18–19 (Spencer 2013). ere Paul uses the verb and noun cognate </p>
<p>forms for “ghting.”</p>
<p>19. Stephens 1987: 35.</p>
<p>20. E.g., Acts 23:23.</p>
<p>21. Similarly, the centurion Cornelius had a devout soldier serving under him he </p>
<p>could trust to go to Joppa to nd Peter (Acts 10:5–8). e persons responsible for recruit-</p>
<p>ment were the strategoi, the military commanders. e strategoi also served as magis-</p>
<p>trates who presided over trials of prosecution for desertion or evasion of military service </p>
<p>(OCD, 120, 1018).</p>
