<p>Receive a Just Crown (4:6–8)</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>the time of my departure stands near (4:6). is verse introduces one of </p>
<p>Paul’s most poignant descriptions of his present suering and imminent </p>
<p>death. While Paul exhorts Timothy to continue in ministry, Paul himself is </p>
<p>in the nal stage of his ministry. He compares himself to an Old Testament </p>
<p>oering, though not a sin or guilt oering since Christ has already forgiven </p>
<p>his sins. Neither is he a fellowship or peace oering because he knows God </p>
<p>is present with him. He describes himself as a drink oering. Drink oer-</p>
<p>ings of wine were combined with meal oerings every day, every Sabbath, </p>
<p>and every festival at the temple, as together they were presented to the Lord </p>
<p>(Hos 9:4).</p>
<p>41</p>
<p> Paul describes himself as presently (already) being such an of-</p>
<p>fering.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>He is not the one making the oering happen, but, nevertheless,</p>
<p>by calling himself a drink oering, he sees his life as a gi being presented </p>
<p>to God. e eventual giving of his life-blood is similar to the pouring out of </p>
<p>red wine. He is indeed oering his body as a living sacrice to God (Rom </p>
<p>12:1). </p>
<p>Aer he describes his forthcoming death in metaphorical terms, as </p>
<p>an oering, then, in more literal terms, he states the time of his departure </p>
<p>stands near (4:6). e Lord had rescued Paul from all his previous dicul-</p>
<p>ties (3:11) but now the right time (kairos)</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>has come. Time is personied</p>
<p>as a person (a soldier) standing nearby,</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>ready to escort him to depart life</p>
<p>in the esh (Phil 1:22–23).</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul then describes further why this is the right time in three almost </p>
<p>parallel clauses: I fought the good ght, I nished the race course, I kept </p>
<p>the faith (4:7). Life is rst described as a ght (agōn), an image from athlet-</p>
<p>ics, which he had already used for Timothy (1 Tim 6:12).</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>e idea of eort</p>
<p>41. M. Yoma 3:5; Lev 23:37–38; Num 15:5; 28:24—29:39. Sometimes a drink was </p>
<p>oered to the Lord in other contexts. Jacob oered a drink oering as thanksgiving for </p>
<p>God’s blessing to him and to consecrate the place where God had spoken to him, Bethel </p>
<p>(Gen 35:9–15). David oered the water his three warriors (Joshebbasshebeth, Eleazar, </p>
<p>and Shammah) drew from the well of Bethlehem in the camp of the Philistines as a drink </p>
<p>oering because he wanted to honor their great sacrice for him (2 Sam 23:8–17).</p>
<p>42. In contrast, in Phil 2:17 he considers the possibility, “if even.”</p>
<p>43. BDAG, 497.</p>
<p>44. See 1 Tim 4:2 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>45. ayer (39) describes departure (analysis) as a metaphor drawn from “loosing” </p>
<p>from moorings preparatory to setting sail.</p>
<p>46. e perfect tense and middle voice (I fought for myself) accentuate that the ght </p>
<p>began in the past and the active agent was Paul himself. In each clause the object precedes </p>
<p>the verb giving emphasis to each object: ght, race course, faith.</p>
