<p>2 Timothy 192</p>
<p>of twenty to thirty people, not all related by blood ties, dwelling or working </p>
<p>together.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> e New Testament has both male and female “heads of house-</p>
<p>holds,” such as Cornelius, Crispus, Stephana(s), and Lydia.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Two times Paul asks the Lord to be merciful to this household (1:16, </p>
<p>18). Mercy is a signicant attribute of God, to which Paul refers in the ad-</p>
<p>dress of both 1 and 2 Timothy (1:2). Paul sees that the Lord was merciful in </p>
<p>forgiving him his great sin as a persecutor of Christians.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> “Mercy” is a fre-</p>
<p>quent word in the Old Testament, being included in many of God’s self-de-</p>
<p>scriptions, such as “the Lord God, compassionate and merciful, persevering </p>
<p>and very merciful and true and keeping justice and mercy for thousands.”</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Clearly, Paul is asking for Onesiphorus’ household to be blessed, but does </p>
<p>Paul have a more specic request in mind? For instance, Jesus reprimands </p>
<p>the Pharisees who have not forgiven the repentant tax collectors and sin-</p>
<p>ners (Matt 9:11–13). Has this household committed some great sin in the </p>
<p>past or is Paul simply asking God that they be blessed in a general way</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>Paul gives two reasons why this household should be blessed: (1) oen </p>
<p>it refreshed Paul, and (2) it was not ashamed of Paul’s chain.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> Onēsiphoros/</p>
<p>on literally is “bringing advantage, benecial”</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>and, indeed, this household</p>
<p>was greatly benecial to the Apostle Paul. When its members refreshed </p>
<p>Paul, literally they caused him “to cool again, to cool o, to recover from </p>
<p>the eects of heat.”</p>

<p>74. Acts 10:2; 11:14; 16:15; 18:8; 1 Cor 1:16; 16:15–18. Inscriptions of female heads </p>
<p>of households in Asia Minor have been found, both widows and married women (Spen-</p>
<p>cer 2005: 71). e married younger widows would become rulers of their households </p>

<p>76. Exod 34:6–7; LXX. See also Exod 20:5–6; Deut 5:9–10; 7:9–10. God shows mercy </p>
<p>by forgiving and saving and renewing people dead in their trespasses (e.g., Eph 2:4–5; 1 </p>
<p>Pet 1:3), giving a child to Elizabeth, who had been barren (Luke 1:57–58, 72, 78), accept-</p>
<p>ing Gentiles (e.g., Rom 15:9), providing a wife for Isaac (Gen 24:12, 14, 44), and helping </p>
<p>Joseph to prosper (Gen 39:21).</p>
<p>77. As in Gen 27:28; 28:4; 40:14; Num 6:25; Ruth 1:9. Some commentators think </p>
<p>Onesiphorus is dead (Robertson 1931: 615; Fee 1988: 236–37; Witherington III 2006: </p>
<p>324–25).</p>
<p>78. Paul’s wrist was chained to the soldier. Normally a prisoner was chained with one </p>
<p>chain of the le hand to a soldier (e.g., Acts 28:20). In severe cases two chains for two </p>
<p>soldiers were used, as in Acts 12:6.</p>
