<p>Titus 252</p>
<p>a ransom for many” (Mark 10:45; Matt 20:28). In these passages (and in </p>
<p>1 Tim 2:6) give (didōmi) and ransom (lytron, lytroō) occur together. In </p>
<p>Titus, Paul brings out the personal nature of Christ’s sacricial gi (in </p>
<p>behalf of us) and explains the twofold purpose of the gi: in order that </p>
<p>he might ransom us from every lawlessness and he might purify for </p>
<p>himself a chosen people (2:14). Ransom, a signicant Old Testament con-</p>
<p>cept, can signify being “delivered” from enemies in a broad sense, as God </p>
<p>“ransomed” the Israelites from the Egyptians.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>In this basic sense, it refers</p>
<p>to being saved from death.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>At Passover, instead of the rstborn of the</p>
<p>Hebrews being killed along with the rstborn of the Egyptians, the Hebrew </p>
<p>rstborn are “ransomed” by the Levites, money, and sheep.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>Humans can</p>
<p>be “redeemed” from indentured slavery.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>Humans can also be “redeemed”</p>
<p>from iniquities (Ps 129:8) and Hades (Pss 48:15; 102:4; Hos 13:14). ose </p>
<p>redeemed become God’s possession (Isa 43:1–3). When Jesus ransoms </p>
<p>humans, he “delivers” them from diculties, dies instead of them, “frees” </p>
<p>them from spiritual slavery and judgment, and thereby cleanses them from </p>
<p>sins eternally (Titus 2:14; Heb 9:7–22). One of the “diculties” is the empty </p>
<p>or lawless way of life (Titus 2:14; 1 Pet 1:18–19). us, people are not ran-</p>
<p>somed simply for their own benet but that they might change their way of </p>
<p>living, becoming one of God’s people, enthusiastic to act in ways pleasing </p>
<p>to God.</p>
<p>Paul concludes this section (2:1–14) with a charge to Titus, summariz-</p>
<p>ing: ese things say and encourage and reprove with all command; let </p>
<p>no one despise you (2:15). Paul sets in a polysyndeton three parallel verbs </p>
<p>which are all equally important (say, encourage, reprove).</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>Each word is</p>
<p>increasingly intensive. Laleō (say) at its root refers to the forming of words </p>
<p>with the mouth (onomatopoetically la-la).</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>Paul uses laleō for “speaking in</p>
<p>tongues” but also for speaking prophecy.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>He uses it for strange or infantile</p>
<p>74. Exod 6:6; 15:13, 16; Deut 7:8; 9:26; 13:5; 15:15; 21:8; Neh 1:10; Pss 7:2; 24:22; 31:7; </p>
<p>43:26; 76:15; 77:42; 105:10; 106:2; 135:24; 143:10; Jer 15:21; 27:34; Mic 6:4; 1 Macc 4:11.</p>
<p>75. See also Num 35:31–32; Prov 6:35; 13:8.</p>
<p>76. Exod 13:11–15; 34:20; Num 3:12–13, 40–51; 18:15–17.</p>
<p>77. Lev 25:47–55; Isa 52:3; Lam 3:58.</p>
<p>78. In this polysyndeton, the same conjunction kai is used between each verb. It lends </p>
<p>rhetorical emphasis by slowing up the rhythm, producing an eect of extensiveness and </p>
<p>abundance, emphasizing the verbs between the conjunctions (Spencer 1998b: 204–5). </p>
