<p>2 Timothy 2102</p>
<p>on behalf of its testimony to Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>People are called by God, but</p>
<p>to become “elect,” they must persevere until the end.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>Of course, Jesus,</p>
<p>the Messiah, the Chosen One, is the ultimate model of someone who per-</p>
<p>severes.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>By persevering as a Christian, Paul serves as a model for other</p>
<p>believers who are (and will) suer for their faith, with the ultimate goal that </p>
<p>they attain salvation in Christ Jesus (2:10). at salvation comes not with </p>
<p>a temporary glory, but an eternal glory</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>(a glory that is continuous and</p>
<p>immeasurable).</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul concludes this rst section of his letter (1:3—2:13) with a pithy </p>
<p>summary statement that is an authoritative, accurate, and fully reliable </p>
<p>teaching from God: e word is trustworthy:</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>for if we died together,</p>
<p>also we will live together; if we persevere, also we will reign together; </p>
<p>if we will deny, also that one will deny us; if we are unfaithful, that one </p>
<p>remains faithful, for he is not able to deny himself (2:11–13). is sum-</p>
<p>mary statement expresses the value of sharing and persevering in suering. </p>
<p>Paul has four conditional clauses, where each condition (protasis) results in </p>
<p>a conclusion (apodosis).</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>ese four sets of clauses (a condition followed</p>
<p>by a conclusion) concern themselves with four concerns in times of perse-</p>
<p>cution: death, perseverance, denial, and unfaithfulness. </p>
<p>In the same way as Paul earlier put priority on Jesus as “risen from the </p>
<p>dead” (2:8), Paul puts priority on living and reigning with Jesus (2:11–12). </p>
<p>He begins with for if we died together (2:11), using the past tense (aorist). </p>
<p>e aorist treats the act of dying as a single whole.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>“Death” is a synecdoche</p>
<p>of the aictions a Christian endures. Paul himself had been near death </p>
<p>many times and now he looks forward to it again.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>Paul looks at death</p>

<p>47. Matt 22:14; Rev 17:14.</p>
48. Heb 12:2–3; Luke 23:35; 1 Pet 2:4, 6. e title elect for an individual may signify
<p>a believer who has had to suer in behalf of Jesus, e.g., 2 John 1, 13; maybe Rom 16:13; </p>
<p>1 Pet 5:13. Later “elect” came to signify a clerically ordained person (Spencer 1985: 111).</p>
