<p>Introduction to 2 Timothy</p>
<p>77</p>
<p> Analytical Outline of 2 Timothy</p>
<p>Paul’s overall purpose in 2 Timothy is to encourage Timothy to join in suer-</p>
<p>ing with him for the gospel which he learned, unlike others who have aban-</p>
<p>doned Paul.</p>
<p>I. Letterhead: Paul reminds Timothy of “the promise that brings life in </p>
<p>Christ Jesus” (1:1–2).</p>
<p>II. Timothy should not be ashamed to suer for the gospel, nor of Paul </p>
<p>suering (1:3—2:13).</p>
<p>A. Timothy should not be ashamed because of his faith and heritage </p>
<p>(1:3–7).</p>
<p>B. He should not be ashamed because of the gospel and Paul’s own </p>
<p>example and teaching (1:8–14). </p>
<p>C. Timothy should follow the example of those of Onesiphorus’ house-</p>
<p>hold, who were not ashamed of Paul’s chains, instead of others in Asia </p>
<p>who turned away from him (1:15–18).</p>
<p>D. Timothy also should join in suering (2:1–13). </p>
<p>III. Timothy needs to remind the people of these things, instead becoming </p>
<p>a vessel for good works, while himself avoiding ungodly talking (2:14–26).</p>
<p>A. He should treat truth with integrity and avoid ungodly talking </p>
<p>(2:14–19).</p>
<p>B. He should become a vessel prepared for good works, pursuing vir-</p>
<p>tues, avoiding controversies, gently guiding the opposition because </p>
<p>they may repent (2:20–26).</p>
<p>IV. Timothy needs to continue in his ministry of evangelism and sound </p>
<p>teaching despite opposition (3:1—4:8).</p>
<p>A. Timothy needs to turn away from lack of genuine piety (3:1–5).</p>
<p>B. Some of the people who have an outward godliness will take women </p>
<p>as prisoners, although eventually their folly will become evident </p>
<p>(3:6–9).</p>
<p>C. Timothy needs to follow Paul’s model, because the godly in Christ </p>
<p>will be persecuted, while evil people will be deceived (3:10–13).</p>
