<p>Titus 114</p>
<p>Despite the close initial similarity between Titus 1:7 and 1 Timothy </p>
<p>3:2, the characteristics for godly elders are set in dierent sequences. Each </p>
<p>list has some moral qualities not in the other list (but certainly not con-</p>
<p>tradictory to the other list). e rst characteristic for leaders (elder and </p>
<p>widow [1 Tim 3:2; 5:7; Titus 1:6]) is that someone be chosen who is not </p>
<p>open to attack, who cannot be discredited, someone against whom a jus-</p>
<p>tiable charge could not be brought (anenklētos) from within the church </p>
<p>(e.g., circumcision party, 1:10) or from outside the church (e.g., 2:5, 8) or </p>
<p>eventually from God (2:13). Even before overt Roman persecution (AD </p>
<p>61–64), Nero’s actions had become more violent than earlier in his reign. In </p>
<p>AD 59, for example, Nero had his mother Agrippina murdered. In AD 62, </p>
<p>senator Seneca retired and Burrus, the serious Prefect of the Praetorians, </p>
died. Both had been positive inuences on Nero. Nero then divorced his
<p>wife Octavia and had her murdered. In AD 62, aer the law of maiestas </p>
<p>minuta was revived, wealthy nobles were executed simply on suspicion. In </p>
<p>other words, before the re in Rome in AD 64, changes in the Roman po-</p>
<p>litical situation were evident. Nero clearly became a volatile, vicious ruler.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Titus (1:6) as in 1 Timothy (3:2; 5:7) having an elder who is (or was) </p>
<p>devoted to his spouse (a one-woman man) would be a dramatic contrast to </p>
<p>many in the larger society.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>In Crete, as in the rest of the Roman and Greek</p>
<p>society, sexual relations between a married free man and a slave or even the </p>
<p>wife of a serf were not ned as “adultery.” According to the ancient Cretan </p>
<p>Gortyn Code, even rape against a household slave received only a penalty </p>
<p>of one to twenty-four obols depending on the circumstances (while against </p>
<p>a free person was 1,200 obols).</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>Elders are described as having faithful children, not in accusation </p>
<p>of wildness or disobedience (1:6). Faithful children may refer either to </p>
<p>children with belief in Jesus (in other words, “Christian” children)</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>or to</p>
<p>children who were trustworthy, for example, as the “trustworthy” word.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But, how can a parent be held responsible for the faith of a child if every </p>
<p>child has free choice?</p>

<p>33. Ngewa (2009: 68) agrees: the “focus is not so much on what the children have </p>
<p>chosen, as on what their father and mother have done” (referring to 1 Tim 3:4).</p>
