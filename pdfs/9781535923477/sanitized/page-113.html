<p>Good Soldier of Christ Jesus (2:3–7)</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>Timothy’s home town, was set in a fertile plain. Second Timothy 2:6 appears </p>
<p>to refer to a more general reward for labor.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>e soldier, athlete, and farmer</p>
<p>labor hard and have rewards for their work.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> In 2 Timothy, the farmer ap-</p>
<p>pears to be a tenant farmer who leases the land, rather than the landowner, </p>
<p>because he looks forward to a share of the crops.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>e fruits or reward</p>
<p>for labor here appear to be salvation in Christ Jesus with eternal glory and </p>
<p>living and reigning together with Christ (2:10–12). us, those who join in </p>
<p>suering as good soldiers of Christ Jesus endure diculties, please Christ, </p>
<p>live according to Christ’s rules, and are rewarded. Whom one serves, how </p>
<p>one serves, and why one serves are important in these illustrations.</p>
<p>Paul concludes this section: Keep pondering what I am saying; for </p>
<p>the Lord will give to you understanding in all (2:7). Paul uses two syn-</p>
<p>onyms: ponder (noeō) and understand (synesis/syniēmi). In contrast, the </p>
<p>teachers of the law do not “ponder” or “grasp.” ey have no perception </p>
<p>of spiritual truths based on careful faith-based thought.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>Timothy should</p>
<p>continue thinking about what Paul has said (2:3–6) or will say (2:8–13), </p>
<p>so that his mind will apprehend its signicance. Timothy should ponder </p>
<p>to understand spiritual truth based on careful faith-based thought that </p>
<p>eects action. Most commentators conclude that Paul wants Timothy to </p>
<p>contemplate the meaning and application of the three metaphors that Paul </p>
<p>just introduced (2:4–6).</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>If Timothy is to ponder some spiritual truth over</p>
<p>30. Paul’s point is similar to 1 Tim 5:18 and 1 Cor 9:7 and Deut 25:4. First Tim 5:18 </p>
<p>has to do with literal wages for a worker. See 1 Tim 5:18 (Spencer 2013); Deut 20:6; Prov </p>
<p>27:18.</p>
<p>31. Mounce summarizes that the main point in all three illustrations is “share in suf-</p>
<p>fering”: “A soldier suers by being forced to ignore civilian aairs. An athlete suers by </p>
<p>training properly. A farmer suers by working hard” (2000: 507). e farmer especially </p>
<p>needs patience, as James explains: “e farmer waits for the precious crop from the earth, </p>
<p>being patient with it until it receives the early and the late rains” (Jas 5:7; NRSV).</p>
<p>32. E.g., Matt 21:33–41; BDAG, 196, 639.</p>
<p>33. Sometimes noeō is more intensive than syniēmi, as in “perceive (noeō) my un-</p>
<p>derstanding (synesis) of the mystery of Christ” (Eph 3:4), where understanding seems to </p>
<p>summarize Paul’s apprehension of the matter. Synesis/syniēmi oen is simply a synonym </p>
<p>for human wisdom (Matt 11:25; Luke 10:21; 1 Cor 1:19; 2 Cor 10:12), yet proconsul Ser-</p>
<p>gius Paulus of Cyprus was a wise or intelligent man because he asked to hear the word of </p>
<p>God from Barnabas and Saul (Acts 13:7). e twelve-year-old Jesus amazed the rabbinic </p>
<p>teachers by his understanding (Luke 2:47). At other times synesis/syniēmi is a synonym </p>
<p>of noeō indicating a level of comprehension that results in action as opposed to hearing </p>
<p>that results in no comprehension (Isa 6:9–10, cited in Matt 13:13–15 and Acts 28:26–27; </p>
<p>Rom 3:11; 15: 21; Matt 15:10; 17:13). See 1 Tim 1:7 (Spencer 2013). E.g., Matt 16:9, 12.</p>
<p>34. E.g., Fee 1988: 243; Mounce 2000: 510–11; Kelly 1963: 176. Marshall (1999: 731) </p>
