<p>2 Timothy 3124</p>
<p>by God to promote God’s message. As Jannes and Jambres were shown not </p>
<p>to be empowered by the only true and most powerful God, so too these </p>
<p>false teachers will be shown to oppose the truth and be less powerful. Does </p>
<p>this mean that the Ephesians were still impressed by magic since Paul men-</p>
<p>tions two magicians? Lock suggests that since this church is fond of Jewish </p>
<p>myths and genealogies and magic (Acts 19:19), Paul gives them an example </p>
<p>of magicians whose folly was exposed.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to opposing the truth, they are characterized by two </p>
<p>phrases: corrupted the mind and discredited concerning the faith (3:8). </p>
<p>God destroys in punishment those who destroy God’s temple.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> How-</p>
<p>ever, humans may destroy or corrupt their own minds.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>Whose minds</p>
<p>are destroyed here?</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>Do the false teachers only destroy their own minds</p>
<p>(“humans of corrupted mind”) or also the minds of the female students </p>
<p>(“humans having corrupted the mind”)? Both will happen. (ey are de-</p>
<p>ceived and deceiving; 3:13.) What is the end result? ey are discredited </p>
<p>or not approved when it comes to the faith.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>Ground that produces thorns</p>
<p>and thistles eventually will be burned (Heb 6:8). An ominous future looms </p>
<p>before these false teachers.</p>
<p>Everyone needs to advance or progress (3:9) in a positive manner.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul promises that false teachers, like Jannes and Jambres, will not progress </p>
<p>in their inuence, because their corrupted mind (nous; 3:8) will be revealed </p>
<p>as a lack of mind or no mind (anous, folly; 3:9) to all people.</p>
<p>Follow Paul’s Model (3:10–13)</p>
<p>Timothy, instead, needs to follow Paul’s model because the godly in Christ </p>
<p>will be persecuted while evil people are being deceived (3:10–13): But, </p>
<p>you, follow aer my teaching, way of life, way of thinking, faith, com-</p>
<p>passion, love, perseverance, persecutions, suerings: what happened to </p>
<p>me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra, what persecutions I endured and </p>
<p>from all the Lord rescued me (3:10–11). roughout this letter, Paul has </p>
<p>46. Lock 1924: 107. See goēs 3:13.</p>
<p>47. 1 Cor 3:17; 2 Pet 2:12.</p>
<p>48. 2 Cor 11:3; Eph 4:22.</p>
<p>49. e verb corrupt is plural nominative to match humans, but mind is singular </p>
<p>accusative.</p>
