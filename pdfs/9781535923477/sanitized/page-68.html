<p>Titus 254</p>
<p>done as a command, elenchō, or the conviction of sin once discovered, com-</p>
<p>mands change (Titus 2:15).</p>
<p>us, Titus is rst to communicate true teaching, then appeal to lis-</p>
<p>teners to follow it, and, nally, if people are still resistant, to exhort them </p>
<p>to stop sinning. Paul concludes with a brief command to Titus: let no one </p>
<p>despise you (2:15), or express a negative opinion against Titus’ leadership. </p>
<p>e same negative connotations can be found in other Jewish literature: </p>
<p>for instance, to dishonor and aront parents because of being ashamed of </p>
<p>them or thinking oneself wiser.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>We do not know how old Titus was. Paul</p>
<p>does not accentuate his youth (as he did with Timothy).</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>Why would the</p>
<p>church at Crete “disregard” or despise Titus? One reason may be simply </p>
<p>because, at times, those who do evil hate the one who shines the “light,” as </p>
<p>Jesus warned (John 3:20). Another additional reason might be that Titus is </p>
<p>a Gentile</p>
<p>95</p>
<p> ministering among Jews and those attracted by legalistic Juda-</p>
<p>ism.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> Already some Jews had complained about Titus (Gal 2:3–5).</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>But,</p>
<p>Paul, whose calling was to preach the gospel to the Gentiles, recalling Titus </p>
<p>to his freedom in Christ (Gal 2:3–7), commands him not to let anyone dis-</p>
<p>regard his leadership (Titus 2:15).</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: The Importance of Holiness</p>
<p>At the turn of the ﬁrst century, an elder called Clement</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>wrote a sermon to his</p>
<p>listeners exhorting them to change because their behavior was dragging the </p>
<p>93. 4 Macc 6:9; 14:1; Josephus, Ant. 4.8.24 (260).</p>
<p>94. Yet see 2:6–8. Paul uses the same root verb, phroneō, with a dierent prex, kata, </p>
<p>in 1 Tim 4:12.</p>
<p>95. See Titus 1:4.</p>

<p>97. Gentiles were not allowed to enter the inner courts of the temple in Jerusalem. </p>
<p>If they did enter, “death without appeal is the sentence” (Philo, Embassy 31 [212]; Acts </p>
<p>21:28; m. Kelim 1:8). Devout Jews were not to marry Gentiles (m. Git. 9:2; J<span class="_ _1" />osephus, <span class="ff4 ls3e wsd2">Ant.<span class="_ _2" /> </span></p>
<p>18.9 [345]). Jews also considered Gentiles to be impure. If they entered a home, they </p>
<p>rendered it unclean (m. Tehar. 7:6; John 18:28). Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah concluded: </p>
<p>“Hateful is the uncircumcision, whereby the wicked are held up to shame, as it is writ-</p>
<p>ten, For all the nations are uncircumcised” (m. Ned. 3:11). Aside from food restrictions, </p>
<p>no wonder Peter said that Jews “can not associate with or approach” a Gentile (Acts </p>
<p>10:10–14, 28; Deut 14:3–21) and even he and Barnabas kept separate from Gentiles for </p>
<p>fear of the circumcision party (Gal 2:11–13).</p>
