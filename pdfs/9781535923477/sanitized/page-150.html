<p>2 Timothy 4136</p>
<p>e nal step is parakaleō, which can include appealing to people, </p>
<p>supporting or helping, and encouraging them.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Paul explains that he</p>
<p>and Timothy “are ambassadors for Christ since God is appealing” through </p>
<p>them. erefore, the Corinthians should “become reconciled to God” (2 </p>
<p>Cor 5:20). Appeal is one stage in the reconciliation process between hu-</p>
<p>mans and God. at appeal is done in all compassion and teaching (4:2). </p>
<p>Compassion is a synonym for gentle mercy. It is the way Paul tells the Gala-</p>
<p>tians a transgressor is to be restored (Gal 6:1). Paul himself was treated with </p>
<p>compassion by Jesus.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>So, Timothy should be loving toward sinners. And,</p>
<p>now is when he should teach them. Education is a means of restoration,</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> </p>
<p>returning Timothy to the rst benet of Scripture: teaching and guiding </p>
<p>(3:16).</p>
<p>e urgency with which Paul exhorts is necessary: For there will </p>
<p>be a time when they will not endure the healthy teaching but accord-</p>
<p>ing to their own passions they will accumulate teachers who scratch </p>
<p>their hearing and, on the one hand, they will turn their hearing from </p>
<p>the truth, while, on the other hand, they will turn away to the myths </p>
<p>(4:3–4). Paul writes in the future about events that have already begun,</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> </p>
<p>but will get worse. Already some women are not coming to knowledge of </p>
<p>the truth (3:6–7). Unhealthy doctrine is being taught at Ephesus (1 Tim </p>
<p>1:3, 10). Paul described some of the causes of susceptibility to deceptive </p>
<p>teaching earlier: being overwhelmed with sins and being led by manifold </p>
<p>passions (3:6). ese same passions result in people not enduring healthy </p>
<p>teaching, but, rather, accumulating teachers that do not bring health. To </p>
<p>endure (anexomai)</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> can be used in a positive sense, if the objective is nec-</p>
<p>essary, as to endure persecution for the faith,</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>an action Paul wants from</p>
<p>Timothy, to join in suering, because all who wish to live in Christ Jesus </p>
<p>in a godly manner will be persecuted (1:8; 3:12). However, here “endure” </p>
<p>is used in a negative sense, since the object should be repelled: teachers </p>
<p>who scratch their hearing (4:3). As in Corinth, where the church had been </p>
<p>accepting a “dierent gospel” than they had received, transmitted to them </p>
<p>by “super apostles” who enslaved, consumed, trapped them, put on airs, </p>
<p>22. See Titus 2:15.</p>
<p>23. See 1 Tim 1:16 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>24. As in 1 Tim 2:11; 2 Tim 2:24–25.</p>
<p>25. See 1 Tim 4:1 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>26. Literally, “to hold one’s self erect and rm” (ayer, 45).</p>
<p>27. 1 Cor 4:12; 2 ess 1:4.</p>
