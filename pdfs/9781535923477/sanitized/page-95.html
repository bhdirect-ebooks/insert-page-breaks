<p>Timothy Should Not Be Ashamed to Suer (1:3—2:13)</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>Many ancient private letters began with a reference to prayer and </p>
<p>reasons to be thankful for the reader (I have gratitude).</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Paul begins by</p>
<p>thanking God whom he serves. Implicitly, he will compare his own situa-</p>
<p>tion with that of Timothy’s. His family too has worshiped God (God, to </p>
<p>whom I serve from my parents’ time).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Not only was Paul a Pharisee, but</p>
<p>his father was a Pharisee (Acts 23:6). His parents were devout, having him </p>
<p>circumcised on the eighth day, rearing him according to the strict legal </p>
<p>requirements of the written and oral Torah (Phil 3:5–6). us, Paul became </p>
<p>“zealous for God” (Acts 22:3), even if misdirected. </p>
<p>When defending himself before the Sanhedrin, Paul describes himself </p>
<p>as having lived before God “with a good conscience” (Acts 23:1).</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Paul’s</p>
<p>conscience is his interior faculty for personal discernment of good and </p>
<p>evil. It aects his conduct and motives for action. Conscience arises from </p>
<p>knowledge that the subject shares with himself or with someone else. When </p>
<p>Paul’s knowledge about Jesus was redirected (1 Tim 1:13–16), the basis for </p>
<p>his convictions changed and his conscience was restructured since it had </p>
<p>never been destroyed (vs. 1 Tim 4:2).</p>
<p>Paul now changes focus from his reasons for gratitude to God for his </p>
<p>own upbringing to Timothy’s upbringing. Paul has unceasing remem-</p>
<p>brance concerning Timothy in his prayers (1:3). In a similar unceasing </p>
<p>manner (“without intermission”),</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Paul had remembered the believers</p>
<p>in Rome (1:9) and in essalonica (1 ess 1:2–3). Paul practiced what </p>
<p>he preached to others (1 ess 5:17). What Timothy, the Romans, and </p>
<p>essalonians had in common was they were people not currently pres-</p>
<p>ent with Paul, and Paul eagerly desired to be in their presence (longing to </p>
<p>see you), but he was not able to do so at that time.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>He wanted to be with</p>
<p>Timothy but was in prison. Paul took his concerns and feelings of disquiet </p>
<p>and thanksgiving and shared them with God.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>e loving expressed by</p>
<p>11. 2 Macc 1:1–9, 11–2:18; Aune 1987: 163, 177, 185–86.</p>
<p>12. “Parents” is a likely translation of progonos since in 1 Tim 5:4 the same term refers </p>
<p>to parents, maybe grandparents (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>13. See 1 Tim 1:5 (Spencer 2013); Titus 1:15.</p>
<p>14. Adialeiptōs, ayer, 11.</p>
<p>15. Paul also “longed” to see the Philippians (Phil 1:8; 4:1). He had never met the </p>
<p>Roman church, but planned to go there. He had been in essalonica but was forced to </p>
<p>leave.</p>
<p>16. e Jewish Sabbath began at night and ended with the day. us, Paul’s point is </p>
<p>that he spent time in prayer, both by night and by day. See Acts 20:31; 1 ess 2:9; 3:10. </p>
<p>Devout Jews would pray three times a day, at dusk, 3 p.m., and dawn, to correspond with </p>
