<p>Teach What Is Consistent with Healthy Doctrine (2:1—3:11)</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>truth, righteousness, peace, and faith (Eph 6:11, 14–16). He is called “that </p>
<p>ancient serpent,” “the deceiver of the whole world” (Rev 12:9). </p>
<p>e devil’s character is implied by aspects of the Letter to Titus. e </p>
<p>devil would encourage wildness, disobedience, attack, self-pleasure, anger </p>
<p>(cf. Eph 4:26–27), drinking, ghting, shameful gain, opposition, decep-</p>
<p>tion, lying, evil, idleness, false teachings, envy, hate, and lawlessness.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>contrast, Paul encourages faith, truth, godliness, eternal life, grace, peace, </p>
<p>salvation, goodness, wisdom, righteousness, holiness, self-control, honor, </p>
<p>love, and perseverance (1:1–4, 8; 2:2–3). us, when Paul calls for women </p>
<p>elders not to slander, he is calling for them not to act in a diabolical way.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e verb diaballō highlights one aspect of the devil’s character—lying about </p>
<p>another person, thereby breaking the ninth commandment, “You shall not </p>
<p>bear false witness against your neighbor” (Exod 20:16; NRSV). Slander, </p>
<p>from a biblical perspective, is a larger concept, referring to deception and </p>
<p>lying that promotes the devil’s kingdom, which would aect the implemen-</p>
<p>tation of many of the Ten Commandments, including having gods before </p>
<p>the Lord, promoting murder (of character at least), and, as well, bearing </p>
<p>false witness (Exod 20:3, 13, 16).</p>
<p>e Pastoral Letters use a couple of synonyms that relate to drinking: </p>
<p>nēphalios (Titus 2:2; 1 Tim 3:2, 11) and paroinos (Titus 1:7; 1 Tim 3:3). In </p>
<p>Titus, the male elders are encouraged to be “sober” (nēphalios), while fe-</p>
<p>male elders are encouraged not to be enslaved to much wine (Titus 2:3).</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Instead of wasting their time being drunk, the female elders are to </p>
<p>teach (2:3). Didaskalos is the same root word used in 1 Tim 2:12. e dif-</p>
<p>ference is that in Crete the women are encouraged to teach what is good </p>
<p>(kalodidaskalos), whereas the women at Ephesus were forbidden from </p>
<p>teaching what is bad.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> e elder/overseer was to love what is good (phila-</p>
<p>gathos, 1:8). e next step would be to teach what is good (2:3). </p>
<p>What is the purpose of teaching what is good? Paul answers with</p>
<p>two adverbial clauses, one stresses the positive (in order that they exhort </p>
<p>the young (females) to be loving their husbands, loving their children, </p>
<p>22. Titus 1:6–7, 9, 11–12, 14, 16; 2:8, 14; 3:3.</p>
<p>23. us, Judas is called “a devil” when he betrays Jesus (John 6:70–71) and Elymas </p>
<p>Bar-Jesus of Cyprus, a false prophet, “a child of the devil” (Acts 13:10), an enemy of </p>
<p>righteousness, full of deceit and trickery, perverting the Lord’s right ways. </p>
<p>24. Athenaeus writes, “at womankind is fond of wine is common report,” and yet </p>
<p>Roman “women are forbidden to drink wine” in Italy, but they can drink passum, a sweet </p>
<p>wine made of raisins, also made in Crete (Deipn. 10.440).</p>
<p>25. See 1 Tim 1:3, 7; 5:13–14.</p>
