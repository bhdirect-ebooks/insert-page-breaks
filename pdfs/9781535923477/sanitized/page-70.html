<p>TITUS 3</p>
<p>Live Godly Lives in the World (3:1–8)</p>
<p>Paul next reminds Titus of general exhortations about how to conduct one-</p>
<p>self in the world. He begins with a command: Remind them to be submis-</p>
<p>sive to rulers, authorities, to obey (a ruler), to be ready for every good </p>
<p>work, to slander no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all humility to </p>
<p>all people (3:1–2). Paul wants Titus to remind</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>the church in Crete to do</p>
<p>three basic actions: to be proactive, maintain good character, and refrain </p>
<p>from some action. </p>
<p>Paul, who has been imprisoned unjustly by the Roman authorities, </p>
<p>warned by Jesus that his followers would be persecuted as their Master has </p>
<p>been (John 15:20), yet also repeatedly implores believers to cooperate with </p>
<p>or be submissive to governing authorities (3:1).</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> In Romans 13, Paul re-</p>
<p>minds believers that all power ultimately comes from God (v. 1) and those </p>
<p>in authority are supposed to encourage good conduct (v. 3).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy</p>
<p>(2:1–4) and Titus (3:1–2), Paul encourages believers to evangelize these </p>
<p>rulers by cooperating with them and praying for them, which in the end </p>
<p>would make believers’ lives better.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> When in Rome, despite the disrepu-</p>
<p>table behavior of the Emperor Nero, Paul did establish positive relation-</p>
<p>1. Hypomimnēskō is also used for Timothy (2 Tim 2:14).</p>
<p>2. Hypotassō (to be submissive, 3:1; see Titus 2:9) basically has to do with coopera-</p>
<p>tion with others, in this case, those governing oneself. e following verb, peitharcheō, </p>
<p>is a stronger verb, which appears to function as an appositive intensifying hypotassō, </p>
<p>signifying to obey one in authority (LSJ, 1353). Archais exousiais may be rendered as an </p>
<p>asyndeton, rulers, authorities (Robertson 1931: 606) or the second noun can serve as an </p>
<p>adjective modifying the rst noun (authoritative rulers). e meaning is similar either </p>
<p>way. Archē foundationally has the idea of “beginning” (e.g., Matt 19:4) or the “rst one” </p>
<p>in preeminence (Col 1:18). Exousia refers to having the power to determine or cause </p>
<p>(e.g., God in Acts 1:7 or humans in Acts 5:4; 8:19; 9:14; 1 Cor 7:37; 2 Cor 10:8). e two </p>
<p>nouns occur together oen as synonyms (e.g., Luke 20:20; 1 Cor 15:24). ey can refer </p>
<p>to human governing authorities that can persecute believers for their faith (Luke 12:11; </p>
<p>20:20) or spiritual powers, such as angelic ones (Jude 6; Eph 1:20–21; 3:10; 6:12; Col </p>
<p>2:15).</p>
<p>3. See also 1 Cor 15:24; 2 Cor 13:10; Col 2:10.</p>
