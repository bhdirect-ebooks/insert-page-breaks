<p>Avoid Ungodly Talking, BecomeaVesselforGoodWorks(2:14–26)</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>Paul exhorts Timothy to remind the people while himself avoiding ungodly </p>
<p>talking and instead become a vessel for good works (2:14–26). Timothy </p>
<p>should treat truth with integrity and avoid ungodly talking (2:14–18). De-</p>
<p>spite ungodly talking, God’s rm foundation stands (2:19). Timothy should </p>
<p>become a vessel prepared for good works, pursuing virtues, avoiding con-</p>
<p>troversies, gently guiding those of the opposition because they may repent </p>
<p>(2:20–26). Before Timothy can leave Ephesus for Rome, he needs to help </p>
<p>the church mature spiritually. Part of joining in suering has to do with en-</p>
<p>suring integrity in one’s own actions and exhorting others to do the same.</p>
<p>Treat Truth with Integrity and Avoid Ungodly Talking (2:14–19)</p>
<p>Paul commands Timothy solemnly to charge the church in the presence </p>
<p>of God (2:14). Paul uses charge (diamartyromai)</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>twice in this letter to</p>
<p>avoid negative behavior and in 4:1, for Timothy himself to act in a posi-</p>
<p>tive manner. Paul charges him not to dispute about words (logomacheō, </p>
<p>2:14).</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>At Ephesus, there continued to be battles about words, arguments</p>
<p>about topics that led to spiritual error.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>ese words are described in two</p>
<p>ways: (1) useful for nothing and (2) for destruction of the ones hearing </p>
<p>(2:14). Paul also describes these words as “godless” and “empty,” leading to </p>
<p>more “ungodliness,” as “a spreading cancer” and deviating from “the truth” </p>
<p>(2:16–18). ese words are not benecial or of any use; they are destructive </p>
<p>to those listening.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In contrast, Timothy must: Make every eort to present yourself </p>
<p>approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly </p>
<p>69. “To exhort with authority in matters of extraordinary importance” (BDAG, 233). </p>
<p>Also “call gods and men to witness, protest solemnly” (LSJ, 403). Diamartyromai is mar-</p>
<p>tyromai (“call to witness”) intensied by the preposition dia-, thus to testify about a seri-</p>
<p>ous content in a serious manner (Luke 16:28; Acts 2:40; 8:25; 10:42; 18:5; 23:11; 28:23). </p>
<p>Paul used the verb several times in his farewell speech in Miletus to the Ephesian elders </p>
<p>to describe his own ministry (Acts 20:21, 24).</p>
<p>70. Paul uses the verb cognate (logomacheō) in 1 Tim 6:4 (logomachia).</p>
<p>71. See 1 Tim 6:4 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>72. Destruction (katastrophē; 2:14) is a strong word in the OT. While literally refer-</p>
<p>ring to turning around and down (as to overturn a table; e.g., Matt 21:12; Mark 11:15; LSJ, </p>
<p>915), metaphorically, it refers to a total destruction of an area, such as God’s destruction </p>
<p>of Sodom and Gomorrah by brimstone and re, resulting in death (Gen 13:10; 19:21, 25, </p>
<p>29). Oen it refers to God’s judgment of the ungodly (2 Chr 22:7; Job 8:19; 15:21; 21:17; </p>
<p>27:7; Prov 1:18, 27). us, the result of these word-battles for the hearer is not simply to </p>
<p>waste time, but to have oneself condemned.</p>
