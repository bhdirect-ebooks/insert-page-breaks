<p>Titus 366</p>
<p>the world because they are justied by God’s grace (3:1–8); and, now, (c) to </p>
have nothing to do with anyone who causes division (3:9–11). Most of the
<p>letter contains instructions for the church. Previously, Paul had exhorted </p>
<p>Titus to be a model of good deeds to other young men (2:7–8), not to let </p>
<p>others despise him in his role as minister (2:15),</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>and rebuke others (1:13).</p>
<p>Now he warns Titus himself: But foolish arguments and genealogies and </p>
<p>contentions and battles pertaining to the law, avoid; for they are useless </p>
<p>and without value (3:9).</p>
<p>Genealogia (genealogy; 3:9) refers to a collection of words (logeia) </p>
<p>about “persons in a family” (genea) or “tracing a pedigree.”</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>Ancestry was</p>
<p>very important to Jews, determining many things, such as eligibility for </p>
<p>inheritance or for the priesthood. A priest had to trace his ancee’s de-</p>
<p>scent four generations to make sure she was qualied to marry him (m. </p>
<p>Qidd. 4:4). Marriage records were sent to the public registries in Jerusalem. </p>
<p>ey kept the records of succession of high priests for 2,000 years (Ag. Ap. </p>
<p>1.7 [30–36]). Knowing or talking about one’s ancestry, in itself, cannot be </p>
<p>wrong, because both Matthew (1:1–17) and Luke (3:23–38) accentuate the </p>
<p>importance of ancestry as a basis for Jesus’ representative nature and eligi-</p>
<p>bility for ministry. In Titus 3:9, the adjective foolish precedes and modies </p>
<p>the four nouns that follow (arguments, genealogies, contentions, <span class="_ _1" /><span class="ff3">battles<span class="ff2">). </span></span></p>
<p>ese are discussions about ancestry that lead to spiritual error.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>Greeks loved to recount stories of mythic ancestry. Legalistic Jews might be </p>
<p>proud of their “pure” ancestry. e current Herodian ruler in Judea (Mar-</p>
<p>cus Iulius Agrippa [Acts 25–26]) himself was of mixed ancestry (Jewish </p>
<p>and Idumaean). He would not be considered “pure.” One’s own genealogy </p>
<p>or that of one’s leaders might be concerns raised in Crete. However, Paul </p>
<p>had already reminded the Christians that God intends all of them to be-</p>
<p>come eligible as heirs (3:7).</p>
<p>In the New Testament zētēsis and zētēma (arguments) can refer to </p>
<p>an ocial or judicial inquiry.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> Zētēsis, zētēma, and zēteuō connote an in-</p>
<p>quiry</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>that is vigorous, a dispute or argument searching for the truth, or</p>
<p>simply resolution, such as when some disciples argued over whether John </p>
<p>the Baptist and Jesus were in competition (John 3:25) or whether circumci-</p>
<p>64. e closing, 3:12., is also personal.</p>
