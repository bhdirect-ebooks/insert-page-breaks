<p>Titus 242</p>
<p>(2:5), one would expect that the qualities exhorted in the young women </p>
<p>would be positively viewed by the larger society. For instance, Xenophon’s </p>
<p>ideal wife says her mother told her, her duty is to be wise (sōphroneō; Oec. </p>
<p>7.14).</p>
<p>Hypotassō (verb) and its noun (hypotagē; submit) are used in the Pas-</p>
<p>toral Letters for wives to husbands (2:5), slaves to masters (2:9), the ruled </p>
<p>to ruling authorities (3:1), students to teachers (1 Tim 2:11), and children </p>
<p>to parents (1 Tim 3:4). e New Testament never commands one adult </p>
<p>human to subject another adult human.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In contrast to some in the larger society, Paul has Titus address his </p>
<p>words to females directly (2:3), whereas Aristotle, for example, addresses </p>
<p>his to male masters (Pol. I.ii.2 [1253b]). Aristotle uses the language of one </p>
<p>human ruling another in the household (archō, Pol. I. ii. 8, 12 [1254a-b]), </p>
<p>which Paul does not. Although hypotassō can be used for hierarchical re-</p>
<p>lationships, it can also be used for mutual or equal authorities, as proph-</p>
<p>ets who are subject to other prophets, allowing each other to speak and </p>
<p>evaluate each other’s message (1 Cor 14:29–33), Christians to Christians </p>
<p>(Eph 5:21), the Son and the Father (1 Cor 15:27–28), the people served and </p>
<p>those serving in ministry (Corinthians and Stephana’s household, 1 Cor </p>
<p>16:15–18). Wives, along with other Christians, are exhorted to be support-</p>
<p>ive presences in actions and words. ey are respectively to cooperate with </p>
<p>their husbands, treating them as valuable.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>is is particularly important</p>
<p>(and challenging) in a society where the father or husband was the pater-</p>
<p>familias or chief priest who held the power of life and death over the entire </p>
<p>household.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>Paul encouraged the young women to work in the household (oik-</p>
<p>ourgos; 2:5). In contrast to postindustrial societies, in ancient times all </p>
<p>people worked in the household, as Xenophon explains, husband and wife </p>
<p>are “partners (koinōnos) in the household (oikos).” Xenophon goes on to </p>
<p>explain that men work outdoors, while women work indoors (Oec. 7.30), </p>
<p>however, the outdoors and the indoors are all part of the household. In </p>
<p>contrast, the model of an ideal biblical, capable wife works both outdoors </p>
<p>32. Only the case of parent to child is unclear. Although the parent is to have “chil-</p>
<p>dren in submission” (1 Tim 3:4) yet they are not to “provoke” their children to anger </p>
<p>(Eph 6:4). e only use of the active voice in the NT of hypotassō is of God the Father or </p>
<p>God the Christ to all of creation at the end or beginning of time (Phil 3:21; 1 Cor 15:27; </p>
<p>Heb 2:8; Ps 8:6). </p>
