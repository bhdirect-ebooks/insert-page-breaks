<p>God’s Word Is Not Bound (2:8–9)</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>from the standpoint of the future: also we will live together. He correlates </p>
<p>death with life (zaō), alluding to his previous references to “eternal life.”</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A number of verbs begin with the preposition sun (“together with”):</p>
<p>56</p>
<p> </p>
<p>synapothnēskō (“die together”), syzaō (“live together”), and symbasileuō </p>
<p>(“reign together”) (2:11–12). ey complement Paul’s central impera-</p>
<p>tive to Timothy: to “suer together with” (synkakopatheō; 1:8; 2:3). All of </p>
<p>these verbs describe the action of being “together with” or accompanying </p>
<p>someone. e object of each of these verbs is omitted: die with whom? Live </p>
<p>with whom? Reign with whom? Primarily, Paul refers back to Christ Jesus </p>
<p>(2:10),</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>but he probably also includes other believers. In the same way,</p>
<p>“join in suering” has a double allusion: Timothy suering for the gospel </p>
<p>and for Christ Jesus and Timothy suering with Paul.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e second set of clauses begins with the ongoing present tense and </p>
<p>ends with the future tense: if we keep persevering,</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>also we will reign</p>
<p>together (2:12a). Believers become joint heirs with Christ, “if we suer </p>
<p>together that also we may be gloried together.”</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>Heirs reign over their</p>
<p>kingdoms.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>When Jesus by his blood ransomed his people, he made them</p>
<p>a kingdom, rulers on earth, and priests to serve God.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>But, Paul presents</p>
<p>the diculties in living as a Christian in an antagonistic world (death and </p>
<p>the need to persevere), before he presents the rewards (life and reigning). </p>
<p>Otherwise, believers might want to reign in order to avoid any costs to </p>
<p>discipleship (1 Cor 4:8–13). e rst two sets of clauses end with a positive </p>
<p>conclusion. Death results in life, perseverance in victory.</p>
<p>undergoes in baptism” (Kelly 1963: 179–80).</p>
<p>55. 1 Tim 1:16; 6:12; Titus 1:2; 3:7.</p>
<p>56. Robertson 1934: 626–28. </p>
<p>57. Paul’s message to Timothy is similar to his message to the Philippians. He desires </p>
<p>to know Christ and “the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suerings, </p>
<p>becoming like him in his death” (3:10).</p>
<p>58. Paul has expressed both ideas in other letters. He told the Romans that if they </p>
<p>died with Christ, they would also live with him (Rom 6:8). He also told the Corinthians </p>
<p>that Paul and Timothy loved them so much they would die together and live together </p>
<p>with them (2 Cor 7:3).</p>
<p>59. See 1 Tim 2:10 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>60. Rom 8:17; also, 1 Pet 4:13. Martyrs and those who persevere through trials in </p>
<p>particular will reign (Luke 22:28–30; Rev 3:21; 20:4).</p>
<p>61. Spencer 1985: 68–69.</p>
<p>62. Rev 5:9–10; 22:5; Dan 7:27.</p>
