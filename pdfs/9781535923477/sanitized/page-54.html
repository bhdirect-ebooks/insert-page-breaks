<p>wise, pure, working at home, good, being subject to their own hus-</p>
<p>bands) and the second avoids the negative (in order that God’s word not </p>
<p>be blasphemed) (2:4–5). e rst purpose of the teaching is to help the </p>
<p>younger women become wise. Exhort (sōphronizō) literally is to cause one </p>
<p>to become wise or to recall or bring people to their senses.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>At rst glance,</p>
<p>for the young women to be exhorted to love their husbands and children </p>
<p>seems to apply to a domestic role limited to the female sex. However, the </p>
<p>male elders also are encouraged to be “healthy” “in love” (2:2). In contrast </p>
<p>to Crete, where the wives are challenged to love their husbands (2:4), in </p>
<p>Ephesians 5, the husbands are challenged to love their wives (Eph 5:25, 28, </p>
<p>33). e situation of women varied among the diering ancient cultures. </p>
<p>Cretan marriage was a public, state-controlled ceremony, involving those </p>
<p>who belonged to the same age-grade and same social class.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>However, the</p>
<p>wives usually did not join the husbands’ homes until later when the young </p>
<p>women had learned how to manage household aairs.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>Most marriages</p>
<p>were arranged. For example, in Xenophon’s Oeconomics, the husband says </p>
<p>to the wife, “I took you and your parents gave you to me” to obtain “the best </p>
<p>partner of home and children” (Oec. 7.11). us, love for one’s husband </p>
<p>had to be learned. Paul places responsibility for the training on the female </p>
<p>elders. Neither Titus nor the husbands teach the women (cf. Xenophon, </p>
<p>Oec. 7.8–9), nor the mothers, as we might expect. Paul wanted Christian </p>
<p>models for the younger women.</p>
<p>A Christian’s responsibility to one’s family is very important. One’s </p>
<p>spouse and children are one’s closest neighbor (“Love your neighbor as </p>
<p>yourself,” Matt 22:39). Similarly, elders are to be a “one-woman man, hav-</p>
<p>ing faithful children, not in accusation of wildness or disobedience” (Titus </p>
<p>1:6; and 1 Tim 3:2, 4–5).</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>Love is the greatest motivator both for the one</p>
<p>loving and the one being loved.</p>
<p>If one is sound of mind (wise, sōphrōn, 2:5) with self-control (also </p>
<p>needed by elders/overseers [1:8; 1 Tim 3:2]), then one result will be pu-</p>
<p>rity. Purity is important for elders too (1:8; 2:2). Five dierent synonyms </p>
<p>for “holy/pure” are used in Titus for leaders (hosios [1:8], semnos [2:2], </p>
<p>26. BDAG, 986; LSJ, 1751; ayer, 613; e.g., Josephus, J.W. 2.18 (493). See Titus 2:2.</p>
<p>27. An exception would be a minor who was allowed to marry an heiress who could </p>
<p>be even as young as twelve to safeguard the household’s interests.</p>
<p>28. Spartans could not live with their wives until the men were 30 years of age (Strabo, </p>
<p>Geogr. 10.4.20 [C482]; Willetts 1965: 112–14). </p>
