<p> In the early years aer the New Testament, female el-</p>
<p>ders had leadership in the church.</p>
<p>If presbytēs and presbytis in Titus 2 refer to leadership positions, how </p>
<p>do they relate to the qualications in 1:6–9? In the same way as Paul de-</p>
<p>scribes the ministers/deacons in 1 Timothy 3:8–10 in a general way rst </p>
<p>and then goes on to describe the female and male distinctive qualities (3:11, </p>
<p>12), also in Titus, Paul rst describes the general qualities of an elder/over-</p>
<p>seer (1:6–9) and then goes on to highlight qualities on which the men (2:2) </p>
<p>and the women (2:3) need to work. Another way to understand the passage </p>
<p>is that, in the same way as everyone is encouraged to seek an overseeing </p>
<p>oce (episcopēs) in 1 Timothy 3:1, but then the distinctive qualities of over-</p>
<p>seer (episcopos) and minister/deacon (diakonos) are delineated in 3:2–13, </p>
<p>so the elders, youth, and slaves are encouraged to seek positive qualities </p>
<p>that would make them eligible to serve as Christian leaders.</p>

<p>den by some (Brooten 1982: 43, 45). It forbade any more presbytides (canon 11). Herm. </p>
<p>Vis. used presbytis and presbytera as synonyms for the church (Vision 1 [2:2], Vision 2 </p>
<p>[5:3; 8:1]). See 1 Tim 5:5–6. See also Kroeger 2002: 757.</p>
