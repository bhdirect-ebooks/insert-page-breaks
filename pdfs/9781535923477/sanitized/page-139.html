<p>Timothy Needs to Continue in Ministry despite Opposition (3:1—4:8) </p>
<p>125</p>
<p>interspersed negative (what not to do) and positive (what to do) comments. </p>
<p>With the explicit pronoun you (3:10), Paul personally addresses Timothy. </p>
<p>He had warned him to keep turning away from the people who love them-</p>
<p>selves, money, and pleasure more than they love God (3:2–5). Instead, Tim-</p>
<p>othy is to follow aer nine aspects of Paul’s life.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>e rst three attributes</p>
<p>are close in meaning: his teachings and leading or conduct (way of life, and </p>
<p>way of thinking or goals).</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>e next attribute, of course, is the central one:</p>
<p>faith. In Titus 2:2, the male elder was to be “faithful, loving, persevering,” </p>
<p>the same exact words and sequence Paul has used in 2 Timothy 3:10 (but </p>
<p>in 2 Tim compassion is inserted aer faith). Paul uses these same three at-</p>
<p>tributes to refer to Timothy.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> e battle at Ephesus is over faith and love.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul highlights three specic reections of faith, which are fruits of the </p>
<p>Spirit (Gal 5:22–23) and also attributes of God: compassion, love, perse-</p>
<p>verance (3:10). God had been compassionate with Paul by being merciful </p>
<p>toward him, forgiving him.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p> Paul will later exhort Timothy to be compas-</p>
<p>sionate (4:2). To persevere</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>until the end is the trait Timothy most needs</p>
<p>if he is to join in suering with Paul despite persecutions and suerings. </p>
<p>Jesus had warned his disciples that the believer without roots falls away </p>
<p>when trouble or persecution arises, unlike the believer in “good soil” who </p>
<p>hears the word, understands it, and bears fruit (Matt 13:21–23). However, </p>
<p>no trouble or hardship or persecution could ever separate a believer from </p>
<p>Christ’s love (Rom 8:35).</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>While diōgmos (persecutions) is concrete and</p>
<p>specic,</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> pathēma (suerings) is more abstract and general.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>Paul uses</p>
<p>pathēma to refer to the suerings of Christ,</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>the suerings from living as</p>
<p>a Christian,</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>and the suerings from one’s own mortality living in a fallen</p>
<p>52. As Esther had followed Mordecai (Esth 2:20), so Timothy was to follow Paul.</p>
<p>53. See 2 Tim 1:9.</p>
<p>54. See 1 Tim 6:11 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>55. 1 Tim 1:14; 2:15; 2 Tim 1:13.</p>

<p>57. See 2 Tim 2:10, 12.</p>
<p>58. e church of essalonica had been renowned for its perseverance and faith </p>
<p>despite persecutions and pressures (2 ess 1:4).</p>
<p>59. e noun diōgmos comes from the verb diōkō, “to make to run or ee, put to </p>
<p>ight, drive away” (ayer, 153).</p>
<p>60. Pathēma comes from the verb paschō to feel, in a bad sense, to feel misfortunes, </p>
<p>to suer, to undergo evils, to be aicted (ayer, 472, 494).</p>
