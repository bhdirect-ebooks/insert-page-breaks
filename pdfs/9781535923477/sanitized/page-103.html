<p>Timothy Should Not Be Ashamed to Suer (1:3—2:13)</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>Guard Sound Words (1:13–14)</p>
<p>Paul now returns his attention to Timothy: Keep holding onto a model </p>
<p>of sound words which you heard from me in faith and love, the one in </p>
<p>Christ Jesus. Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit, the one </p>
<p>dwelling among us (1:13–14). e deposit is the sound or healthy words </p>
<p>that Timothy heard from Paul himself (1:13). Paul exhorts Timothy to keep </p>
<p>holding</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>the model or pattern or standard of words that he received from</p>
<p>Paul. Paul himself was a model or example of one aspect of the gospel mes-</p>
<p>sage: Christ’s mercy toward sinners.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>ese words or teachings promoted</p>
<p>spiritual health (sound).</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>In contrast, some people only want teaching</p>
<p>that promotes disease (1 Tim 1:10; 2 Tim 4:3). True words themselves are </p>
<p>health-inducing, but the listener must also receive the words in a receptive </p>
<p>manner, in faith and love. Faith and love, already mentioned in this letter </p>
<p>as exemplary virtues, are two key ingredients in healthy teaching.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>ose</p>
<p>who are not receptive to health-inducing words may be attempting to al-</p>
<p>leviate their spiritual illnesses by supercial or harmful ways (2 Tim 4:3). </p>
<p>Ultimately, however, the faith and love that enabled Timothy to hear Paul’s </p>
<p>message came from Christ Jesus, who is exemplary of faithfulness and love.</p>
<p>e words Paul passed on to Timothy are not only “healthy,” they are </p>
<p>also good and a deposit, entrusted for safekeeping (1:14).</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>Even as Jesus</p>
<p>guards Paul’s deposit, simultaneously Timothy needs to guard his deposit.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Timothy received Paul’s sound teaching in (en) Christ Jesus’ faith and love </p>
<p>(1:13). En basically signies “within.”</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>It is as if Timothy lived within the</p>
<p>surrounding presence of Jesus. Simultaneously, Timothy is to guard his de-</p>
<p>posit through (dia) the Holy Spirit (1:14). e Holy Spirit as “the agent is </p>
<p>conceived as coming in between the non-attainment and the attainment of </p>
<p>55. Or “gripping onto.” </p>
<p>56. See 1 Tim 1:16 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>57. See Titus 1:13. Healthy words and teaching are also mentioned in 1 Tim 1:10; </p>
<p>Titus 1:9; 2:1; 2 Tim 4:3.</p>
<p>58. See 1 Tim 1:5, 14 (Spencer 2013); 2 Tim 1:5, 7.</p>
<p>59. See 1 Tim 6:20 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>60. Guard is aorist imperative, which may: (1) continue the broader overview of the </p>
<p>present imperative “keep holding” (1:13); (2) treat the act of guarding as a single whole </p>
<p>action; or, (3) be an “impressive” aorist which is more authoritative and solemn than the </p>
<p>present (Robertson 1934: 832, 856).</p>
<p>61. “at the location is within the bounds marked by the word with which it occurs” </p>
<p>(Robertson 1934: 586–87).</p>
