<p>Greetings (4:19–22)</p>
<p>157</p>
<p>Trophimus was a Gentile from Ephesus. Because he was present with </p>
<p>Paul, some Jews from Asia falsely accused Paul of bringing this Gentile into </p>
<p>the temple in Jerusalem (Acts 21:27–29). us, ultimately, Trophimus is </p>
<p>responsible for Paul’s arrest and rst imprisonment in Jerusalem, Caesarea, </p>
<p>and Rome (Eph 3:1). Paul never had the opportunity to explain in Jerusa-</p>
<p>lem that Trophimus never entered the temple. In his defense speech, when </p>
<p>Paul repeated the Lord’s call to him: “Go, for, I myself, I will send you to </p>
<p>Gentiles far away,” the crowd became so wild, the tribune had to remove </p>
<p>Paul (Acts 22:21–24). Apparently, Trophimus tried to accompany Paul on </p>
<p>this journey almost ten years later, but, when Trophimus became sick, Paul </p>
<p>le him behind at some household or inn to be healed.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul now succinctly states his main reason for writing: Make every </p>
<p>eort, before winter, to come (4:21a)! is is the third time Paul uses the </p>
<p>imperative of spoudazō in this letter: Make every eort to present yourself </p>
<p>to God (2:15) and make every eort to come to me quickly (4:9).</p>
<p>156</p>
<p>Because</p>
<p>of dangerous winter weather, safe traveling was done between May through </p>
<p>October (or, at the far limits, March 10 to Nov 10). e dangers of winter </p>
<p>sailing were “scant daylight, long nights, dense cloud cover, poor visibility, </p>
<p>and the violence of the winds doubled by the addition of rain or snow.”</p>
<p>157</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e trip from Ephesus to Rome might take anywhere from two weeks to </p>
<p>two months.</p>
<p>158</p>
<p>Walkers averaged een to twenty miles a day and coastal</p>
<p>ships twenty-ve to thirty-ve miles a day. Timothy had a lot to do before </p>
<p>he could arrive in Rome. Not only did he have to stop at Troas to pick up </p>
<p>Paul’s belongings (4:13) and follow all the directions Paul has given in 2 </p>
<p>Timothy for the church in Ephesus, but he also had to do the many activi-</p>
<p>ties necessary before travel. Land or sea voyagers would have to bring their </p>
<p>own clothing, supplies for cooking, eating, bathing, and sleeping (from pots </p>
<p>and pans down to mattresses and bedding), and servants to pack, cook, </p>
<p>155. According to tradition, he became the rst bishop of Arles in Gaul and, like </p>
<p>Paul, he was martyred during Nero’s persecution at Rome (Brownrigg 1971: 440; Baring-</p>
<p>Gould 1897: 15:322–23).</p>
<p>156. I have chosen the rendering make every eort or “to be especially conscientious </p>
<p>in discharging an obligation,” rather than simply “to proceed quickly, hurry” (BDAG, </p>
<p>939), because in every NT reference to spoudazō and spoudaios outside of 2 Tim 4:9, </p>
<p>21 and Titus 3:12, “hurry” does not t the context as well. For example, Paul exhorts </p>
<p>Timothy to “make every eort to be approved” by God in 2 Tim 2:15. Also, even in 1 </p>
<p>ess where Paul does refer to a trip, as in 2 Tim 4:21, he made the eort but was not able </p>
<p>to come (1 ess 2:17–18).</p>
