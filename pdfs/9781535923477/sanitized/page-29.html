<p>accusation of wildness or disobedience” (Titus 1:6) may very likely modify </p>
<p>the “children” (wildness and disobedience being the antithesis of faithful </p>
<p>or “trustworthy”). When children cannot be relied upon to obey the parent, </p>
<p>they are “unfaithful.” ey are incorrigible (asōtos, asōtia). ese children </p>
<p>are leading abandoned, dissolute lives.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>e same adjective is used for what</p>
<p>happens as a result of drunkenness (Eph 5:18), the wild living of Gentiles </p>
<p>(1 Pet 4:3–4), the Gentile immorality and disobedience of the law of fol-</p>
<p>lowers of Bacchys in the temple of Jupiter (2 Macc 6:2–7). is is the life </p>
<p>once led by the prodigal son (Luke 15:13). Children who live such a wild </p>
<p>life dishonor their parents (Prov 28:7). ey will not be subject to control </p>
<p>of the parents (Heb 2:8). ey are consistently disobedient, without any law </p>
<p>(anypotakta; 1 Tim 1:9).</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To what age is a parent responsible for a child? Ancients, as many </p>
<p>today, tended to classify people by whether they were minors</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>or whether</p>
<p>they had or had not yet reached puberty.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> Adulthood or mature citizen-</p>
<p>ship was marked by new clothing in Crete.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> However, in the New Testa-</p>
<p>ment, children (teknon) is a generic term that can refer to the unborn (Rev </p>
<p>12:4–5), babies under two years of age (Matt 2:16–18), twelve year olds </p>
<p>(Luke 2:48), those mature enough to work but are living with their parents </p>
<p>(Matt 21:28; Luke 15:31), and as a term of endearment for an adult cowork-</p>
<p>er.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>us, Paul uses a general term in Titus. In addition, adult “children”</p>
<p>oen continued to live within the household of the parents. e child was </p>
<p>responsible to the paterfamilias even in adulthood.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>When the Christians are trying not to give opportunity for charges </p>
<p>(kategoria) by the church or the larger society (1:6; 2:5, 8), for elders to have </p>
<p>such wild children would be dangerous for the church. e impact would </p>
<p>be especially harmful in such communal settings as Crete and other ancient </p>
<p>Greek societies. Such wild living had already aected “whole households” </p>
<p>(Titus 1:11). </p>

<p>36. E.g., nēpios, Gal 4:1, 3, vs. huios, Gal 4:7. e Cretans dened a “runner” (drom-</p>
<p>eus) as over twenty as opposed to an apodromos (Willetts 1965: 113).</p>
<p>37. Willetts 1965: 113. m.’Abot 5:21 says at thirteen a child is responsible to fulll </p>
<p>the law.</p>
