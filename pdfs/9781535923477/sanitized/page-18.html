<p>Cretans claimed that Zeus was born in a cave in Crete and that</p>
<p>Crete was the birthplace of many deities.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Although females in Crete did not have all the political rights that </p>
<p>men had, in Minoan Crete women were probably the social equals of men </p>
<p>and participated in all activities including the dangerous sport of vaulting </p>
<p>over charging bulls.</p>

<p>(509), the Minoan Mistress of Wild Nature developed into the Great Mother of Asia </p>
<p>Minor (with lions) and the virgin huntress of Greece. e Minoans “personied the Su-</p>
<p>preme Principle as a woman to whom was subordinate a young male” (401). </p>
