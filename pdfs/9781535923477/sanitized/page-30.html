<p>Titus 116</p>
<p>An additional important reason for believers with wild children not </p>
<p>to take on the responsibility of oversight of the church was to allow them </p>
<p>the time to reach out to their children. e Old Testament has continual </p>
<p>references to the importance of parents educating their children, for ex-</p>
<p>ample, at Passover,</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>reminding their children of what God did in their</p>
<p>midst (Deut 4:9–10; Ps 78:3–8) and who God is (Deut 6:4–7). Similar </p>
<p>exhortations can be found in the New Testament (e.g., Eph 6:4; 1 ess </p>
<p>2:11–12). e church needed children who were cooperative members of a </p>
<p>mini-nation, the household.</p>
<p>In ancient Greece and Rome, the household, with more of an extend-</p>
<p>ed family, is larger than in many contemporary North American and Eu-</p>
<p>ropean households. A household would include all persons economically </p>
<p>dependent on a master—children, even adult sons, slaves, freedpersons, </p>
<p>clients, spouses of all these persons, including the master’s spouse.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p> Aristo-</p>
<p>tle explains that the household (oikia), the “partnership” for “everyday pur-</p>
<p>poses,” in its “perfect form,” consists of slaves and free persons, “master and </p>
<p>slave, husband and wife, father and children” (Politics I.1.6–7; I.2.1). e </p>
<p>household might include twenty to thirty people.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>An ancient household</p>
<p>would be an extended family with all the workers in the family business </p>
<p>who lived in one housing complex.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>In the Cretan society the household was of considerable importance.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One Minoan palace would sustain hundreds of people.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>e relatives and</p>
<p>followers would construct their houses radiating out from the palace at </p>
<p>the center.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>e Cretans were particularly communal. Meals and sleeping</p>
<p>quarters were communal, one for the young men, another for the young </p>
<p>women. Even mature men ate together. Contributions from the harvest </p>
<p>were made by serfs toward worship of the gods, upkeep of public services, </p>
<p>and to meals for citizens. Even marriage was collective: the young men </p>
<p>were required to marry at the same age.</p>
