<p>by Joseph as ruler over a household and all of Egypt (Acts 7:10). In addition, </p>
<p>the function of steward is explicitly mentioned in Titus 1:7 (oikonomos). </p>
<p>e establishment of elders is modeled by Moses, who chose trustworthy </p>
<p>and honest judges over groups of a thousand, hundred, y, and ten to </p>
<p>judge the minor cases while he handled the dicult cases (Exod 18:13–26). </p>
<p>ese judges were chosen by the tribes themselves and were trained by </p>
<p>Moses (Deut 1:9–18). Later, the Lord commands Moses to gather seventy </p>
<p>of these judges so that they too would be lled with the Spirit as Moses was </p>
<p>and share his leadership burdens. In addition, the Spirit came upon Eldad </p>
<p>and Medad, who prophesied in the camp (Num 11:16–17, 24, 26). </p>
<p>In Greco-Roman times, Jewish elders had authority in religious and </p>
<p>civic matters. ey handled city administration and jurisdiction. e coun-</p>
<p>cil of elders (and chief priests in Jerusalem [or Sanhedrin]) decided cases of </p>
<p>orthodoxy and heterodoxy with the power of possible excommunication.</p>

<p>In a village, one of the elders might be chosen to be “ruler of the synagogue” </p>
<p>to oversee the worship service and the synagogue building and represent </p>
<p>the congregation to Roman ocials.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Presbyteros (elders), like presbeia (“a</p>
<p>delegation”), could represent a group or a person, to ask for a favor, peace, </p>
<p>or the resolution of dierences.</p>

<p>e Jewish Christians appeared to have adapted the Jewish leadership </p>
<p>format. Christian elders rst appear in Acts. Elders in Jerusalem receive the </p>
<p>gis collected by Barnabas and Saul (Paul) for the starving Christians in Ju-</p>
<p>dea (Acts 11:29–30). As in Crete, at the second visit to new churches in Asia </p>
<p>Minor, Paul and Barnabas oversaw the election of elders in every church </p>
<p>(Acts 14:23). e apostles and elders in Jerusalem would decide questions </p>
<p>of heterodoxy versus orthodoxy (Acts 15:2–23; 16:4). e whole church </p>
<p>would consent to their decision. Even as the apostles, Christian elders have </p>
<p>the responsibility to pray for healing (Jas 5:14; Mark 6:13). </p>
