<p>2 Timothy 2100</p>
<p>time, understanding the meaning of the three metaphors appears rather </p>
<p>simple. However, if Paul wants Timothy to ponder the dangerous path of </p>
<p>suering that lies ahead for him, that would certainly take more time.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Timothy’s path and Paul’s path were reminiscent of Jesus’ nal path to Je-</p>
<p>rusalem (Luke 9:51–53). </p>
<p>God’s Word Is Not Bound (2:8–9)</p>
<p>Paul now gives additional reasons why Timothy should endure suering. </p>
<p>It results in salvation for others and himself (2:8–13). Timothy needs to </p>
<p>remember that, even though Paul is bound, God’s word is not bound: Keep </p>
<p>remembering Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, from David’s seed, ac-</p>
<p>cording to my gospel, in which I suer evil to the point of bonds as an </p>
<p>evil doer, but God’s word is not bound (2:8–9). Paul still is developing the </p>
<p>theme why Timothy should partner in suering with him for the gospel. He </p>
<p>has already mentioned how Jesus, full of grace, as Savior, destroyed death </p>
<p>and brought life (1:9–10; 2:1). Now, he reminds Timothy to keep in his </p>
<p>mind two things about Jesus Christ: (1) Christ was risen from the dead </p>
<p>and (2) he is from David’s seed (2:8). roughout 2 Timothy, Paul employs </p>
<p>“Christ Jesus,”</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>highlighting his status as Messiah (or Christ). is time</p>
<p>Paul calls him Jesus Christ, possibly because he emphasizes Jesus as the </p>
<p>descendant of King David and the prototype human who was raised from </p>
<p>the dead. In Romans, Paul describes Jesus as “David’s seed according to the </p>
<p>esh” (1:3).</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>Jesus, then, is an apt model of hope for Timothy because those</p>
<p>writes that Paul could be referring to 2:8–13 but that is less likely. Towner (2006: 496) </p>
<p>concludes that 2:7 refers backward but also forward to the phrase that follows.</p>
<p>35. Towner (2006: 497) explains: “Timothy’s path was leading to Rome and suering. </p>
<p>It was a hard path in every way. It involved rst selecting new team members to ll the </p>
<p>gaps caused by those who had le the mission team and who would expand the ministry </p>
<p>in Asia. en the challenge of suering at Paul’s side and in his place had to be faced.” In </p>
<p>addition, 2:7 would then bring together all the topics in 2:4–6 to allude back to 2:3, “join </p>
<p>in suering,” and in 2:8 to allude forward to 2:9, Paul’s own suering, and to the trust-</p>
<p>worthy word in 2:11–13. e three illustrations in 2:4–6 are then a part of the picture.</p>
<p>36. 2 Tim has twelve references to “Christ Jesus.” In 1 Tim, he uses “Christ Jesus” </p>
<p>twelve times, “Jesus Christ” two times, “Christ” one time, while in Titus “Jesus Christ” </p>
<p>predominates (three references) with one reference to “Christ Jesus” (UBS).</p>
<p>37. 1 Tim 2:11–12; 1 Cor 1:23–24. Nathan prophesized to David: “Your house and </p>
<p>your kingdom will endure forever before (the Lord); your throne will be established for-</p>
<p>ever” (2 Sam 7:16; TNIV); Isa 9:6–7; 11:1–5; Jer 23:5–6; 33:15–16; Matt 1:1, 6; John 7:42; </p>
<p>Rev 5:5; 22:16; Ignatius, Eph 18.2.</p>
