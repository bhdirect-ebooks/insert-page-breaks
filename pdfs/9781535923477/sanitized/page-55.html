<p>Teach What Is Consistent with Healthy Doctrine (2:1—3:11)</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>hieroprepēs [2:3], and, for the youth, leaders-in-training, (hagnē [2:5] and </p>
<p>aphthoria [2:7]). Hagnē (adjective) and the verb (hagnizō) go back to the </p>
<p>Old Testament to the vow of separation with purity to the Lord. Men or </p>
<p>women could make this vow for a certain time by abstaining from all </p>
<p>products made from the vine, not cutting their hair, not coming near a </p>
<p>dead body, and, nally, bringing oerings to the temple (Num 6:2–21). Or, </p>
<p>Levites would purify themselves by washing their garments (Num 8:21). </p>
<p>Certain symbolic acts were done to demonstrate one’s devotion to God. e </p>
<p>same adjective is used for Jesus (1 John 3:3), Timothy (1 Tim 5:22), Paul,</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a wise teacher or a godly minister (Jas 3:17; 2 Cor 6:6), and betrothed vir-</p>
<p>gins (2 Cor 11:2; 4 Macc 18:7). e young women in Crete who received </p>
<p>the charge to be pure could be married, but they could also be betrothed, </p>
<p>getting prepared for marriage. Peter also uses hagnē to describe the ideal </p>
<p>conduct of wives who are trying to win over their unbelieving husbands </p>
<p>(1 Pet 3:1–2). ere is a lot of similarity between the situation of the wives </p>
<p>in 1 Peter and those in Titus. Both are called to be pure in conduct (1 Pet </p>
<p>3:1–2; Titus 2:5), good, submissive to their husbands in order to “win over” </p>
<p>someone (in 1 Peter the husband, in Titus maybe the husband but denitely </p>
<p>a larger group). </p>
<p>How a Wife Can Win over Nonbelievers </p>

<p>1 Peter 3:1–6</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>Titus 2:5</p>
<p>won over without a word in order that God’s word may not be </p>
<p>blasphemed</p>
<p>being subject to own husbands being subject to own husbands </p>
<p>pure conduct pure </p>
<p>do good good</p>
<p>us, a key component in these instructions is evangelism. Evangelism </p>
<p>is an important element of the whole letter of Titus (and 1 Peter) and an im-</p>
<p>portant motivator for the behavior of all leaders. e elders/overseers must </p>
<p>not be “open to attack” (1:6–7) and children “not in accusation of wildness </p>
<p>or disobedience” (1:6). Titus models good behavior for the leadership to </p>
<p>follow so the opponent cannot say “evil” concerning them (2:8). Since the </p>
<p>goal of the elders’ exhortation is for God’s word not to be blasphemed </p>
<p>30. Paul did the rite of purication in Acts 21:24, 26; 24:18.</p>
<p>31. See further Spencer 2000: 107–19</p>
