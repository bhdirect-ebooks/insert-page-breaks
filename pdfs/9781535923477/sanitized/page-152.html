<p>2 Timothy 4138</p>
<p>four commands also recall previous charges to Timothy.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>Sober has both a</p>
<p>literal and a metaphorical sense. Being sober (nēphō) is an important attri-</p>
<p>bute for elders and ministers.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>Paul tells the essalonians to be sober for</p>
<p>“those who are drunk get drunk at night,” but, since they belong to the day, </p>
<p>they should be sober (1 ess 5:6–8). Synonyms are staying awake, having </p>
<p>self-control, and keeping alert.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>us, “sober” in 2 Timothy 4:5 hearkens</p>
<p>back to “self-control” (sōphronismos) in 1:7. Timothy must be alert if he is </p>
<p>to save himself and his hearers (1 Tim 4:16). </p>
<p>Earlier Paul had explained how he suered evil (kakopoieō) to the </p>
<p>point of imprisonment (2:9). Now he exhorts Timothy to “suer evil” (en-</p>
<p>dure hardship; kakopatheō). is verb is a synonym for the main theme </p>
<p>of the letter, Paul’s exhortation for Timothy to join in suering with him </p>
<p>for the gospel (1:8; 2:3). Paul explains next how he expects his own death. </p>
<p>Timothy himself will experience diculties from the Roman government </p>
<p>(Heb 13:23).</p>
<p>e next command hearkens back to 1:6 (“to keep stirring into ame </p>
<p>God’s gi”) and 1 Timothy: “Do not neglect the spiritual gi in you.”</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>Here</p>
<p>Timothy’s spiritual gi is explicitly mentioned. An evangelist, as a minister </p>
<p>of the word, is a messenger of God’s good news of salvation who preaches, </p>
<p>baptizes, and instructs people in the basics of faith. Having this gi would </p>
<p>help Timothy pastor this church that needs to learn the basics of truth. But, </p>
<p>in a time of persecution, being an evangelist would be dangerous. Never-</p>
<p>theless, Paul reiterates fulll your ministry (4:5), carry it through to the </p>
<p>end.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>Paul himself reminds Timothy how Paul’s own ministry was fullled</p>
<p>at his rst defense when all the Gentiles heard the good news (4:17). </p>
<p>Receive a Just Crown (4:6–8)</p>
<p>Paul concludes this section of the letter exhorting Timothy to continue in </p>
<p>his ministry of evangelism and sound teaching despite opposition (3:1—</p>
<p>4:8) by describing his own future: For I myself already am oered up and </p>
<p>36. Paul begins with the present imperative (continue sober) that presents an over-</p>
<p>view and then moves to aorist imperatives (endure hardship, do work of an evangelist, </p>
<p>fulll your ministry), subsidiary concrete commands (4:5).</p>
<p>37. Nēphalios: Titus 2:2; 1 Tim 3:2, 11.</p>
<p>38. 1 ess 5:6; 1 Pet 1:13; 4:7; 5:8.</p>
