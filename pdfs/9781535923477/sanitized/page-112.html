<p>Towner considers aairs of life could be distractions related</p>
<p>to “living, buying, and selling,” not sinful in themselves, but activities that </p>
<p>might interfere with active military responsibilities.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Paul was encouraging</p>
<p>Timothy to be completely devoted to his commander, Christ Jesus, and to </p>
<p>his citizenship in and his campaign for God’s kingdom.</p>
<p>Paul now uses a related image: athletic competition: But if also some-</p>
<p>one may compete in a contest, (s)he is not crowned unless (s)he might </p>
<p>compete according to the rules (2:5). A soldier could be decorated with a </p>
<p>necklace, armband, and embossed disc placed on the corselet and a centu-</p>
<p>rion could be awarded a gold crown or a silver spearsha.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Athletics was</p>
<p>itself an aspect of preparation for war, which entailed suering.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> In athlet-</p>
<p>ics, one contends for a prize.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>In Paul’s rst illustration, the key is whom</p>
<p>one serves (2:4); here it is how one serves (2:5). Athletics (as opposed to </p>
<p>serving as a soldier) intensies the emphasis on a goal. However, the prize </p>
<p>is not awarded if the contest is not done according to the rules. Athletes </p>
<p>who won games might receive generous monetary rewards as well as many </p>
<p>other honors. A victor in the Sacred Games had a right to free sustenance </p>
<p>or to a pension and was exempt from taxation. A victor might be awarded </p>
<p>a crown or wreath.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>But, “when money enters into sport corruption is sure</p>
<p>to follow.”</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>Sometimes, victory was bought and sold. For example, in 388</p>
<p>BC, Eupolus of essaly bribed his opponents in boxing to allow him to </p>
<p>win the prize. In addition, each sport would have its own regulations.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>too, Timothy needed to follow Christ’s rules (his teachings) to win the goal </p>
<p>of armation by Christ at the last judgment.</p>
<p>e third illustration highlights why one serves: It is necessary the </p>
<p>laboring farmer rst to share in the fruits (2:6). On active duty, a sol-</p>
<p>dier would not himself farm, but, when pensioned o, he might. Lystra, </p>

<p>married upon retirement.</p>
<p>23. Towner 2006: 493; Witherington III 2006: 330. Paul is not literally restricting </p>
<p>Timothy from these activities, even as he is not literally requiring Timothy to be a soldier. </p>

<p>27. To be “crowned” as an honor or reward (stephanoō) could refer to a gi of money, </p>
<p>honor, libations, oce, or wreathe (LSJ, 1642).</p>
