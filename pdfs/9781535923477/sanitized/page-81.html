<p>Avoid Anyone Who Causes Division (3:9–11)</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>sion was necessary for salvation (Acts 15:1–2). Sometimes a verbal dispute </p>
<p>can have physical ramications (Acts 18:12–17). Arguments in themselves </p>
<p>are not wrong, but foolish ones are (Titus 3:9). Foolish can refer to error </p>
<p>that is consciously chosen or to innocence. ose who hear Jesus’ words </p>
<p>but do not act on them deceive themselves and will suer the ramica-</p>
<p>tions for their actions (Matt 7:26–27; 25:2–13). ose religious leaders who </p>
<p>make judgments that value what is less important also will be judged (Matt </p>
<p>23:13–26). ese are arguments about topics that lead to spiritual error. </p>
<p>Eris (contentions) and machē (battles) are synonyms for zētēsis </p>
<p>(arguments; 3:9).</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>In 3:9, they seem to be in intensifying sequence. Eris</p>
<p>personied is a goddess who “excites to war.”</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>Eris can be a result of not</p>
<p>acknowledging God and a synonym for jealousy (Rom 1:28–29; 13:13). It </p>
describes the ghting in Corinth when the church divided over who was
<p>the best leader.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> In secular Greek, eris referred mostly to “battle-strife.”</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Machē refers to the battle or combat of armies.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>Paul uses it for external</p>
<p>conict (2 Cor 7:5). us, arguments necessitating resolution (zētēsis) be-</p>
<p>come jealous contentions that incite people (eris) to full battles (machē). </p>
<p>And in the mix are the questions of genealogy and the law.</p>
All of these divisive topics, equally, Titus is to avoid. Titus is to turn
<p>himself around away from arguments and genealogies and contentions </p>
<p>and battles pertaining to the law that lead to error (3:9).</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> He is not to par-</p>
<p>ticipate; he is not to encourage others because: they are useless (anōphelēs), </p>
<p>do not prot anyone</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> and they are without value, a waste of time (ma-</p>
<p>taios). e circumcision party wastes its time in such words.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>e opposite</p>
<p>is love that comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere </p>
<p>faith (1 Tim 1:5). Paul warns Titus (and Timothy in 2 Tim 2:16) not to get </p>
<p>involved in disputes that do not lead to truth. </p>
Instead, Titus should warn (at least twice) people who create divisions
<p>with such arguments (3:9–10). And, aer such warnings, then he should </p>

<p>74. Paul holds the imperative verb to the end of the clause emphasizing all that Titus </p>
<p>is to avoid. e polysyndeton, repetition of and, amplies the list.</p>
