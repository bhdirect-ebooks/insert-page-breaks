<p>2 Timothy 190</p>
<p>the object in view.”</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>Timothy is ultimately responsible to guard his deposit,</p>
<p>but he needs to do so by means of the Holy Spirit. e Holy Spirit can </p>
<p>empower him to do the guarding.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>But how near is the Holy Spirit? e</p>
<p>Holy Spirit is very near, because the Holy Spirit is the one dwelling among </p>
<p>us (1:14).</p>
<p>64</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Example of Believers in Asia (1:15)</p>
<p>Paul now illustrates by negative and then positive examples those who have </p>
<p>not and have guarded their deposit (1:14), those who have and have not </p>
<p>been ashamed of Paul, and those who have and have not joined in suering </p>
<p>with Paul (1:8). Timothy knows about the rst negative example because </p>
<p>he most likely is in Ephesus in Asia:</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>You know this, that all turned away</p>
<p>from me, the ones in Asia, including Phygelus and Hermogenes (1:15). </p>
<p>Asia had many Jews.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>In Jerusalem, some Asians opposed Stephen; others</p>
<p>opposed Paul (Acts 6:9; 21:27; 24:19). At rst, Paul, Silas, and Timothy were </p>
<p>not allowed by the Holy Spirit to preach the good news in the province of </p>
<p>Asia (Acts 16:6), referring to the province that included Ephesus. Asia was </p>
<p>bounded by the province on the north of Mysia, on the south of Caria, and </p>
<p>on the east of Phrygia and by the Aegean Sea on the west.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>But eventually</p>
<p>Paul went to Ephesus in Asia with Priscilla and Aquila (Acts 18:19—20:1, </p>
<p>18), where many became believers, including Epaenetus, the rst convert </p>
<p>to Christ in Asia (Rom 16:5), and Tychicus, Trophimus (Acts 20:4), and </p>
<p>Onesiphorus’ household. e believers formed many churches who send </p>
<p>greetings to the church in Corinth (1 Cor 16:19).</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>us, Paul experienced</p>
<p>the great moving of the Holy Spirit in Asia, but also great diculties. He </p>
<p>remembers his earlier experience in Asia as having received the “sentence </p>
<p>62. e root idea of dia is “be-tween, in two,” “passing between two objects or parts of </p>
<p>objects” (Robertson 1934: 580–83). See 1 Tim 2:15 (Spencer 2013); 1 Cor 8:6.</p>
<p>63. See 1 Tim 4:1 (Spencer 2013); Titus 3:5.</p>
<p>64. See 2 Tim 1:5 and Rom 8:9, 11. Other qualities of the Spirit are described in 1 Tim </p>
<p>4:1 and Titus 3:5. In contrast, “spirit” most likely refers to the human spirit in Timothy </p>
<p>and Jesus in 2 Tim 1:7; 4:22; 1 Tim 3:16.</p>
<p>65. See Introduction to 2 Timothy.</p>
<p>66. See Introduction to 1 and 2 Timothy (Spencer 2013). Phygelus is attested only by </p>
<p>inscriptions from Ephesus and Miletus (Witherington III 2006: 323).</p>
<p>67. Bruce 1990: 354; OCD (1970: 131) set the boundaries of Asia as Bithynia on the </p>
<p>north, Lycia on the south and Galatia on the east.</p>
<p>68. Seven churches in Asia are addressed in Rev 1:4, 11.</p>
