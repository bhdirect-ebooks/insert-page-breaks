<p>2 Timothy 4142</p>
<p>of righteousness is the reward that Paul expects, the righteousness that </p>
<p>comes from God based on faith (Phil 3:9). But this reward is not just Paul’s, </p>
<p>rather it is to all the ones having loved his appearing (2 Tim 4:8). </p>
<p>Does appearing refer to Jesus’ incarnation or second return to judg-</p>
<p>ment? Sometimes Paul clearly uses appearing to refer to Jesus’ second re-</p>
<p>turn to judgment</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> but at other times to Jesus’ incarnation.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>ese people</p>
<p>have long loved Jesus’ appearing (4:8). us, it could refer to the prospect </p>
<p>of Jesus’ second return or to the action of Jesus’ rst coming to earth or </p>
<p>both. e Lord will grant clearly refers to the future, but the love of believ-</p>
<p>ers has been present for a while.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Come Soon (4:9–18)</p>
<p>Aer this expectant look to the future (4:8), Paul has completed exhort-</p>
<p>ing Timothy to continue in his ministry of evangelism and sound teaching </p>
<p>despite opposition (3:1—4:8). Now Paul exhorts Timothy: Make every ef-</p>
<p>fort to come to me soon (4:9). is act of coming is Timothy’s rst step </p>
<p>in joining Paul in suering (1:8; 2:3). Paul then cites several reasons why </p>
<p>he would like Timothy to come soon, before winter (4:21): (1) Paul is le </p>
<p>almost all alone (4:10–11a); (2) he needs human and material resources </p>
<p>(4:11b-13); and (3) he was abandoned at his rst defense—and opposed </p>
<p>(4:14–18). How was Paul abandoned while a group of Christians in Rome </p>
<p>greet Timothy (4:21)? Probably Paul was incarcerated in a military camp </p>
<p>or palace, where it was not as easy to have company as when he was un-</p>
<p>der house arrest during the rst Roman imprisonment.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>Sometimes Bible</p>
<p>students envision Paul as a self-sucient independent minister, but these </p>
<p>verses indicate how relational and communal and interdependent Paul was. </p>
<p>He was building on the precedence of Jesus’ action to send out the Twelve </p>
<p>and the Seventy-two, “two by two.”</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul mentions four coworkers: Demas has abandoned me, having </p>
<p>loved the present age, and he went into essalonica, Crescens into Ga-</p>
<p>latia, Titus into Dalmatia; Luke is only with me (4:10–11a). e most </p>
<p>65. 1 Tim 6:14; Titus 2:13. Towner 2006: 616.</p>
<p>66. 2 Tim 1:10; Titus 2:11; 3:4. Robertson concludes that “appearing” in 4:8 could </p>
<p>refer to either (1931: 631).</p>
<p>67. See 2 Tim 4:1. Appearing in 4:1 could refer to the incarnation.</p>
<p>68. See 2 Tim, Occasion.</p>
<p>69. Mark 6:7; Luke 10:1.</p>
