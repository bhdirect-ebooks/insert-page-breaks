<p>God’s Word Is Not Bound (2:8–9)</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>who suer now will have hope for the future since the crucied Messiah is </p>
<p>also the risen Messiah.</p>
<p>Paul has used the phrase my gospel two times previously.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>Here, the</p>
<p>phrase reminds Timothy of what he has “heard” from Paul (2:2). Paul is </p>
<p>highlighting that the gospel he preaches includes suering. Paul suers to </p>
<p>the point of being imprisoned unjustly, even as Jesus was crucied between </p>
<p>two criminals, although he was righteous, Paul is in bonds (desmos), but </p>
<p>God’s word is not bound (deō; 2:9). Ironically, Paul had bound male or </p>
<p>female followers of the Way in Damascus,</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>but now he was bound himself</p>
<p>for the same reason he bound others. He writes that he is treated as an evil </p>
<p>doer.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>Ultimately, Paul realizes he had been persecuting Jesus (Acts 9:4–5),</p>
<p>who himself had been bound,</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>unjustly, and was now sharing his fate. But,</p>
<p>no matter the situation, those who suer unjustly for Christ’s sake can still </p>
<p>promote their message of good news (4:17). </p>
<p>On account of this</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>I endure all things on account of the elect, in</p>
<p>order that also they themselves might attain salvation in Christ Jesus </p>
<p>with eternal glory (2:10). By implication, Timothy, too, should endure suf-</p>
<p>fering, thereby helping others. e principle idea in endure</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>in a context </p>
<p>of suering is perseverance in one’s faith in Christ despite persecution for </p>
<p>that faith. “e person persevering to the end, this one will be saved,” Jesus </p>
<p>taught his disciples.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> Paul considers Jesus’ teaching from another perspec-</p>
<p>tive. e person who perseveres even through imprisonment (not only </p>
<p>saves him/herself, but also) can help other believers.</p>
<p>Elect is frequently used in the New Testament for believers in a con-</p>
<p>text of suering. To be “elect” is to be special or precious to God.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>One of</p>
<p>the things the church is elected or picked out or chosen for is for suering </p>
<p>38. Rom 2:16; 16:25. e message entrusted to Paul: 1 Tim 1:11; 1 Cor 15:1–2; Gal </p>
<p>1:11; 2:2.</p>
<p>39. Acts 9:2, 14, 21; 22:5. See 1 Tim 1:13 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>40. Ramsay (1893: 249) explains that kakourgos “refers expressly to the agitia, for </p>
<p>which the Christians were condemned under Nero, and for which they were no longer </p>
<p>condemned in AD 112.” Mounce 2000: 514.</p>
<p>41. Matt 27:2; Mark 15:1; John 18:12, 24.</p>
<p>42. “is” is neuter to allude back to “gospel.”</p>
<p>43. See 1 Tim 6:11 (Spencer 2013). ayer, 644. Literally it is used for “remain be-</p>
<p>hind” in, e.g., Luke 2:43; Acts 17:14.</p>
<p>44. Matt 10:22; 24:13; Mark 13:13; also Rom 12:12; Jas 1:12; 5:11; 1 Pet 2:20.</p>
<p>45. See 1 Tim 5:21 (Spencer 2013); also Titus 1:1; Ps 105:6; Isa 43:20–21; Col 3:12; </p>
