<p>Conclusion (3:12–15)</p>

<p>know. Everyone with Paul sends a written “kiss” toward Titus.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>en, Paul</p>
<p>commands Titus to greet not everyone, but only those loving us in the </p>
<p>faith. At rst glance, Paul may appear unnecessarily restrictive. However, </p>
previously he had commanded Titus to reject divisive people (3:10), even as
<p>he commanded the churches not to associate with those who are disobedi-</p>
<p>ent.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>e kiss of peace is not to be extended to those who are not at peace</p>
<p>with God’s message.</p>
<p>Ancient Greek letters would terminate with a nal “farewell” (“be in </p>
<p>good health”)</p>
<p>113</p>
<p> and begin with a greeting (chairō).</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>Paul, in comparison,</p>
<p>refers to grace (chairō or charis), both at the beginning and end of this </p>
<p>letter (1:4; 3:15) and many of his letters. He does not clarify to whose grace </p>
<p>he refers. Earlier in the letter, “grace” is a quality that ows from God and </p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>us, again good deeds (3:14) are placed under the larger</p>
<p>rubric of grace (3:5, 15).</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>As in 2 Corinthians 13:13 (14), Paul adds all.</p>
<p>e churches at Crete and Corinth are besieged by heterodox persons. Nev-</p>
<p>ertheless, God’s grace is for them too. It is for everyone. Grace envelopes </p>
<p>deeds in Paul’s message to Titus.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: The Place of Grace</p>
<p>What is the foundation of all good behavior? It is grace, mercy, love, salvation, </p>
<p>kindness. When I was a college student and not yet a conﬁrmed believer in </p>
<p>Jesus as Lord of the Universe and as my Lord, I was invited to attend a meeting </p>
<p>of the InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. It was a Friday night. The night was </p>
<p>a supreme example of what not to do as a bearer of good news. The Christian </p>
<p>111. See also Rom 16:16; 1 Cor 16:20; 2 Cor 13:12; 1 ess 5:26. Among friends the </p>
<p>greeting is accompanied by a kiss (BDAG, 144).</p>
<p>112. 1 Cor 5:11–13; 2 ess 3:14–15.</p>

<p>115. Titus 1:4; 2:11; 3:4–7. In many of Paul’s letters, the closing blessing refers to the </p>
<p>grace of the Lord Jesus (1 Cor 16:23; 2 Cor 13:13 [14]; Gal 6:18; Phil 4:23; 1 ess 5:28; </p>
<p>2 ess 3:18; Phlm 25). “e Lord be with you” is the way Boaz greeted his reapers, a </p>
<p>model for the way Jews should greet each other (Ruth 2:4; m. Ber. 9:5). </p>
<p>116. e closing blessing is identical to Hebrews 13:25. It is almost identical to 1 Tim </p>
<p>6:21; 2 Tim 4:22; Col 4:18, but they omit “all.”</p>
