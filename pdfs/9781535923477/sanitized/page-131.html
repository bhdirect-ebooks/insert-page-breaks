<p>2 TIMOTHY 3</p>
<p>Timothy Needs to Continue in Ministry despite Opposition </p>
<p>(3:1—4:8) </p>
<p>In this third major section (3:1—4:8) of the letter, Paul exhorts Timothy to </p>
<p>continue in his ministry of evangelism and sound teaching despite opposi-</p>
<p>tion, turning away (3:1–5) from those who lack genuine piety, opposing </p>
<p>the truth and taking women as prisoners. Eventually their folly will become </p>
<p>evident (3:6–9). Instead, Timothy needs to follow Paul’s model, expecting </p>
<p>the godly in Christ to be persecuted and evil people to be deceived (3:10–</p>
<p>13), while Timothy remains in the Scriptures, which prepare him for every </p>
<p>good work (3:14–17). Paul exhorts Timothy, in light of Jesus’ judgment, </p>
<p>to proclaim the word at all times because a time is coming when people </p>
<p>will turn from healthy teaching to myths and Paul will be gone (4:1–6), to </p>
<p>receive with all who love the Lord a just crown (4:7–8). </p>
<p>Lack of Genuine Piety (3:1–5)</p>
<p>As in 1 Timothy 4:1, Paul mentions the last days: And know this, that in </p>
<p>the last days dicult times will be present (3:1). ese last days are now </p>
<p>here, having already begun with Jesus’ incarnation and life, aer Pentecost.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And, in these last days, life for an evangelist will be more dicult.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> If be-</p>
<p>ing captured alive by the devil’s trap sounds terrifying (2:26), Paul depicts </p>
<p>days so violent as to be compared to possession by demoniacs who prohibit </p>
<p>any human from passing through them (Matt 8:28). Paul describes people </p>
<p>characterized by nineteen negative qualities: for people will be loving </p>
<p>themselves, loving money, boastful, haughty, blasphemous, disobedient </p>
<p>to parents, unthankful, unholy, unloving, irreconcilable, slanderous, </p>
<p>without self-control, savage, not loving the good, traitors, reckless, de-</p>
<p>luded, loving pleasure more than loving God, having an outward form </p>
<p>1. See 1 Tim 4:1 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>2. Enistēmi (be present) normally refers to the present age (Rom 8:38; 1 Cor 3:22; </p>
<p>Gal 1:4; 2 ess 2:2; Heb 9:8–9).</p>
