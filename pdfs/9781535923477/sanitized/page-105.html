<p>Timothy Should Not Be Ashamed to Suer (1:3—2:13)</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>of death,” because Paul and Timothy and other coworkers were “so utterly, </p>
<p>unbearably crushed that we despaired of life itself ” (2 Cor 1:8–9). Sadly, </p>
<p>now again Asia is giving Paul diculties. All turned away from Paul does </p>
<p>not include Onesiphorus’ household and Tychicus (2 Tim 4:12). us, Paul </p>
<p>speaks of the majority. How devastated Paul must have felt when those </p>
<p>whom he taught for many years rejected him at this dicult time in his </p>
<p>life! But, likewise, Jesus when he was arrested and crucied was rejected by </p>
<p>even his close disciples.</p>
<p>69</p>
Paul highlights two particular individuals in Asia:
<p>Phygelus and Hermogenes (1:15).</p>
<p>70</p>
<p> Example of Onesiphorus’ Household (1:16–18)</p>
<p>In contrast to most believers in Asia was Onesiphorus’ household: Might </p>
<p>the Lord give mercy to Onesiphorus’ household, that oen it refreshed </p>
<p>me and was not ashamed of my chain, but having been in Rome dili-</p>
<p>gently sought me and found me. Might the Lord give to them (it/him) </p>
<p>to nd mercy from the Lord in that day (1:16–18a). Onesiphorus could </p>
<p>be Onēsiphoros (a male) or Onēsiphoron (a female).</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>Paul was probably</p>
<p>visited not by one person but by a group of people,</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>not necessarily the</p>
<p>entire household. Oikos may refer to a set of apartments, all a person pos-</p>
<p>sesses, or to a homestead and all the people who live in the house. It would </p>
<p>include the extended family and workers in the family business who lived </p>
<p>in the housing complex, in other words, all the persons economically de-</p>
<p>pendent on one master (children, adult sons, slaves, freedpersons, clients, </p>
<p>and spouses of all these persons). A household was a partnership, a group </p>
<p>69. John 18:15–18, 25–27; 20:19.</p>
<p>70. e second-century (AD 185–195) forgery by an elder of Asia Minor, Acts of </p>
<p>Paul and ecla, recounts Demas and Hermogenes, the coppersmith, as Paul’s travelers </p>
<p>who pretended they loved him and were jealous of Paul’s positive estimation of One-</p>
<p>siphorus. ey believed the resurrection had already taken place. Acts Paul 3.1, 4, 14; 2 </p>
<p>Tim 2:17–18. In contrast to this author, Paul was positive toward marriage: Acts Paul 3.5, </p>
<p>11–12, 16 vs. 1 Tim 4:3; 5:14.</p>
<p>71. Both endings have been found, but many ancient references refer to the neuter </p>
<p>form, Onēsiphoron, which refers to females (New Docs 4:181–82). However, the second-</p>
<p>century elder who wrote the Acts of Paul and ecla named Onesiphorus was a “man” </p>
<p>with a wife Lectra and children Simmias and Zeno from Iconium (3.2). Also in tenth-</p>
<p>century codex 181.</p>
<p>72. Autō in 1:18 may refer either to the masculine or neuter singular dative ending, </p>
<p>thereby, referring either to oikos, “household,” or “him,” or “it,” but household is the </p>
<p>closest antecedent.</p>
