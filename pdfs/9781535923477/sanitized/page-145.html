<p>Timothy Needs to Continue in Ministry despite Opposition (3:1—4:8) </p>
<p>131</p>
<p>ers may learn that some actions done are sinful, and, thereby, reproved. </p>
<p>But the process does not end with reproof, it continues on to restoration. </p>
<p>“Health” is a frequent metaphor Paul uses in the Pastorals. “Straight” is a </p>
<p>synonym. e word of truth should be handled “rightly,” cut in a straight </p>
<p>line (orthotomeō).</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>e Scriptures also help people to become “straight,”</p>
<p>restoring people to an “upright or a right state.”</p>
<p>107</p>
<p> Epictetus exhorts his stu-</p>
<p>dents: “What sort of a teacher, then, do you still wait for, that you should </p>
<p>put o reforming yourself until he arrives?” (Ench. 51.1). In comparison, </p>
<p>the Scriptures teach and restore or reform and are always available. Finally, </p>
<p>Paul ends with guidance (paideia; 3:16), the day-by-day instruction activ-</p>
<p>ity Timothy was to do with his opponents (2:24–25). is guidance is not a </p>
<p>worldly one; rather, it is the one in righteousness (3:16).</p>
<p>Scripture’s nal goal is: that God’s person may be complete, being </p>
<p>completed fully for every good work (3:17). In 1 Timothy 6:11, Paul had </p>
<p>exhorted Timothy as God’s person to ee the love of money and instead </p>
<p>pursue “righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, gentleness.” </p>
<p>Now, he wants Timothy to be complete (artios; 3:17), “complete, perfect </p>
<p>of its kind, suitable, exactly tted” to the purpose; “full-grown,” “sound, of </p>
<p>body and mind”; “prepared, ready.”</p>
<p>108</p>
<p> us, as a result of studying Scrip-</p>
<p>ture, Timothy is completely prepared for every good work (3:17), since all </p>
<p>study of Scripture must be practical. Otherwise, its intended purpose has </p>
<p>been distorted. Learning without knowing and applying the truth (3:7) is </p>
<p>inconceivable to Paul. Learning Scripture while engaging in foolish argu-</p>
<p>ments is contradictory (2:23). Studying Scripture is intended to prepare </p>
<p>Timothy to be a vessel of the Master for holy behavior (2:21).</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons: Why Study the Bible? </p>
<p>In summary, based on 2 Timothy, why should someone rely on the Bible?</p>
<p>106. See 2 Tim 2:15. Epanorthōsis has as its stem orthos, “straight, erect,” the same </p>
<p>root as in orthotomeō.</p>
<p>107. ayer, 228.</p>
<p>108. LSJ, 249. BDAG (136) denes artios as “being well tted for some function, com-</p>
<p>plete, capable, procient.” Paul uses the same root twice: artios and exartizō. Artizō, the </p>
<p>verb, signies “get ready, prepare” (LSJ, 249).e ex- (“out of, from within”), which here </p>
<p>functions as a perfective (Robertson 1934: 596; 1931: 628), intensies the verb artizō, </p>
<p>thereby signifying “to complete, nish” (LSJ, 587).</p>
