<p>bathe in preparation for entering God’s sanctuary. Newborn babies also </p>
<p>were washed (Ezek 16:4, 9). us, washing became an apt metaphor for not </p>
<p>sinning, as in “Wash you, be clean; remove your iniquities from your souls </p>
<p>before mine eyes; cease from your iniquities” (Isa 1:16). In Titus 3:5, Paul </p>
<p>reminds his readers that simply being reborn washes or puries one from </p>
<p>sin. is idea was previously explained in Titus 2:14: Jesus died in order </p>
<p>that people might be ransomed and cleansed. </p>
<p>e second agent of salvation is the Holy Spirit (3:5). e Holy Spirit </p>
<p>makes people new (anakainōsis).</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>e Holy Spirit gives life. When God</p>
<p>sends forth the Holy Spirit, life is created and the earth is made new again </p>
<p>(Ps 103:30). Despite diculties experienced through ministry that may af-</p>
<p>fect Christians’ outer nature, their “inner nature is being renewed day by </p>
<p>day” (2 Cor 4:16; NRSV). Paul uses the imagery of pouring (ekcheō; 3:6) </p>
<p>to describe the experience of being made new by the Holy Spirit. is verb </p>
<p>continues the imagery of washing (3:5), because water can be poured out to </p>
<p>ll a container. e same verb for “pouring” was used to describe the enter-</p>
<p>ing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples at Pentecost (Acts 2:17–18, 33) and </p>
<p>the manner in which God’s love enters human hearts (Rom 5:5).</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>Similarly,</p>
<p>the Holy Spirit “lls” humans bringing birth (Luke 1:35) and rebirth (Titus </p>
<p>3:5). </p>
<p>e subtle mystery of the Triune God is included in Titus.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>Either</p>
<p>God as a whole or God the Father is the Savior who is described as kind </p>
<p>and loving and merciful. Rebirth is accomplished by the agency of the </p>
<p>Holy Spirit, who is poured out generously (3:4–5). is “pouring” is ac-</p>
<p>complished by the agent, Jesus Christ (who is also our Savior [3:6]), who </p>
<p>made people righteous by means of God’s grace (3:7). All three Persons of </p>
<p>the Trinity are merciful and generous and work together to accomplish the </p>
<p>same goal: that we might become heirs (3:7).</p>
<p>e theme of inheritance is a frequent and important one in the Old </p>
<p>and New Testaments. Abraham set out from Chaldea to receive an inheri-</p>
<p>tance for himself and his descendants.</p>

<p>43. e Spirit is rst mentioned in the beginning of the Bible when the Spirit of </p>
<p>God hovers over the waters (Gen 1:2). Living water is a symbol of the Holy Spirit (John </p>
<p>7:38–39). Water, essential for life, is a symbol of blessing (Mal 3:10; Joel 2:23–28). </p>

<p>Trinity” (Jerome 2010: 339).</p>
<p>45. Heb 11:8; Gen 11:31–12:5; Josh 24:2–13.</p>
