<p>Titus 362</p>
<p>these good actions are good for people, for themselves, and for others (Ti-</p>
<p>tus 3:1, 8, 14). </p>
<p>Dikaioō (verb), dikaiosynē (noun, 3:5), dikaios (adjective), and dikaiōs </p>
<p>(adverb) each occur once in Titus. e root word is dikē,</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>which signies</p>
<p>“right, justice.” It can refer to a judicial hearing or decision, a trial, and </p>
<p>to the execution of the sentence,</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>as when Aristotle describes those who</p>
<p>play a part in “judicial justice,” who judge claims (Pol. IV.III.13 [1291a]). </p>
<p>Paul uses the word-family frequently to refer to righteous as a synonym </p>
<p>for “holy.”</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>For instance, it is a characteristic of an overseer and a right way</p>
<p>to live (Titus 1:8; 2:12). It would certainly include the idea of justice, but as </p>
<p>well holiness. God is holy and those who approach God in an unacceptable </p>
<p>way die (Lev 16:2, 13). For example, on the Day of Atonement all sins were </p>
<p>placed on a goat who was released outside the city and, thereaer, the Jews, </p>
<p>cleansed from sins, were now “clean” before the Lord.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Jesus permanently</p>
<p>took on the sins of the world to purify those who believe in him.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>Because</p>
<p>of Jesus’ death, the unrighteous who had no inheritance but now believe in </p>
<p>Jesus have been declared righteous heirs of God’s kingdom by the righteous </p>
<p>Judge.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How then did God save them? ey were not saved by their own good </p>
<p>deeds. Rather, they were saved according to God’s attribute of mercy (3:5). </p>
<p>Mercy hearkens back to God’s compassionate character (3:4). ere were </p>
<p>two agents of salvation: washing of rebirth and renewal by means of the </p>
<p>Holy Spirit (3:5). Palingenesia (rebirth) appears to refer to the same expe-</p>
<p>rience as Jesus explains to Nicodemus: one must be born from above to see </p>
<p>God’s kingdom (John 3:3, 7). Washing is an important image in the Bible. </p>
<p>It can refer to literal everyday bathing.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>But for the Jews washing was a</p>
<p>regular procedure for priests</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>and others who may have become unclean</p>
<p>from touching a dead body</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> or having had a skin disease.</p>
