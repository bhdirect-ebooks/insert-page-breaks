<p>Timothy Needs to Continue in Ministry despite Opposition (3:1—4:8) </p>
<p>127</p>
<p>being judged, because of jealousy or misunderstanding or falsehood, may </p>
<p>occasion reprisal. To live in Christ Jesus reminds the reader of the suer-</p>
<p>ings Christ endured and Jesus’ warning: “if they persecuted me, also they </p>
<p>will persecute you” (John 15:20).</p>
<p>Lest Timothy be enticed, Paul reminds him again that evil people do </p>
<p>not advance or progress to the better:</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>But evil people and imposters will</p>
<p>advance to the worse, leading astray and being led astray (3:13). Paul </p>
<p>describes the evil people as imposters (goēs). But, goēs also signies “sor-</p>
<p>cerer, conjuror.”</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>e use of goēs appears to allude back to the magicians</p>
<p>or sorcerers Jannes and Jambres (3:8). ese evil people both lead others </p>
<p>astray and are themselves led astray (3:13), possibly by deceitful spirits (1 </p>
<p>Tim 4:1).</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> Some of Paul’s own coworkers had been led astray.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>Remain in the Scriptures (3:14–17)</p>
<p>Paul repeats again the personal pronoun you (3:14), directly exhorting </p>
<p>Timothy, that in contrast to these evil people and imposters who have </p>
<p>been led astray and now lead others astray, Timothy needs to remain in the </p>
<p>Scriptures, which prepare him for every good work (3:14–17): But, you, </p>
<p>remain in what you learned and are rmly persuaded, knowing from </p>
<p>whom you learned and that from infancy you know the holy writings, </p>
<p>the ones being able to make you wise into salvation through faith, the </p>
<p>one in Christ Jesus (3:14–15). While you occurs once in 1 Timothy, near </p>
<p>the end (6:11), and once in Titus (2:1), it occurs six times in 2 Timothy, </p>
<p>showing how much Paul has focused this letter toward Timothy. Of these </p>
<p>six references, four of them call Timothy to contrast himself with those who </p>
<p>lead astray (3:9–10), evil people (3:13–14), those who follow myths (4:4–5), </p>
<p>and Alexander, a harmful person (4:14–15).</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>us, the repetition of you</p>
<p>intensies the dicult context of people who could harm Timothy’s faith.</p>
<p>70. 2 Tim 3:13; 2:16 vs. 3:9.</p>
<p>71. BDAG, 204; LSJ, 356. Incantations used to be uttered in a kind of howl (goaō; </p>
<p>ayer, 120). Goēs was a derogatory term used against Moses (Josephus, Ag. Ap. 2.16 </p>
<p>[161]).</p>
<p>72. See Titus 3:3. </p>
<p>73. E.g., Demas: Col 4:14 vs. 2 Tim 4:10.</p>
<p>74. In contrast, 2 Tim 1:18; 2:1 are armative of Timothy.</p>
