<p>Titus 248</p>
<p>to God that God “took him.”</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> Christians are to aim to “please” God.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>Faith</p>
<p>and good deeds please God (Heb 11:6; 13:16). Jesus always pleased the </p>
<p>Father when on earth (arestos; John 8:29). Joseph when he was enslaved </p>
<p>(not voluntarily) to the Egyptian Potiphar still was so “well-pleasing” to his </p>
<p>master that Joseph was placed as manager over Potiphar’s household (Gen </p>
<p>39:4). Paul wants the Christian slave to follow Joseph’s example. e oppo-</p>
<p>site of being well-pleasing is being opposing (antilegō; Titus 2:9). Antilegō </p>
<p>is also used to describe the opponents to healthy teaching.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>Certainly the</p>
<p>Christian slave does not want to be included in this group.</p>
<p>e misuse of money is a continual theme at Crete and Ephesus. e </p>
<p>circumcision party was aected by it (1:11). e overseers/elders are to </p>
<p>avoid shameful gain</p>
<p>58</p>
<p> and now, as well, Christian slaves are not to misap-</p>
<p>propriate funds (nosphizō; 2:10). Even as Ananias and Sapphira “set apart” </p>
<p>secretly (and with intent to deceive)</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>part of the proceeds of the sale of</p>
<p>their land (Acts 5:2–3), slaves who managed a master’s property could be </p>
<p>tempted to do the same. Jamaicans call this the Quashie, the sense that the </p>
<p>slave deserves to take secretly what has not been given.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>Although one</p>
<p>can defend taking what one thinks is one’s due, the danger is that one be-</p>
<p>comes used to stealing and, for Paul, one does not promote Christians as </p>
<p>demonstrating themselves to be trustworthy good people (2:10). Instead, </p>
<p>the Christian slave should aim to honor the teaching of the Savior God. </p>
<p>Kosmeō (honor) has a basic sense of put in order, arrange, decorate, make </p>
<p>attractive.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>For the slave who works in the household and could be the</p>
<p>house steward or manager (oikonomos; 1:7), Paul uses a metaphor, compar-</p>
<p>ing the gospel with decorating a house. In the same way as someone might </p>
<p>organize, decorate, and make attractive a house (Matt 12:44; Luke 11:25),</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> </p>
<p>so too by cooperating with the master, being well-pleasing, not opposing, </p>
<p>55. Gen 5:22–24; Sir 44:16 LXX; Heb 11:5.</p>
<p>56. Gen 48:15; Rom 12:1; 2 Cor 5:9; Eph 5:10; Phil 4:18; Heb 13:21; 1 John 3:22 </p>
<p>(arestos).</p>
<p>57. See Titus 1:9.</p>
<p>58. See Titus 1:7.</p>
<p>59. BDAG, 679; ayer, 429.</p>
<p>60. See, e.g., Campbell 1987: 22–23.</p>
<p>61. ayer, 356. See also kosmos.</p>
<p>62. Also graves can be decorated (Matt 23:29), lamps can be arranged (Matt 25:7), </p>
<p>gis can be put in order (Luke 21:5), women can decorate themselves (1 Pet 3:5; Rev </p>
<p>21:2), a city can be arranged (Rev 21:19), and in a deceitful way passions can look attrac-</p>
<p>tive (Titus 2:12).</p>
