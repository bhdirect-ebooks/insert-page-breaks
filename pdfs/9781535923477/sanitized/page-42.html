<p>Titus 128</p>
<p>of sin is done out of a relationship of love, like a parent’s love for a child: </p>
<p>to build up, not simply to tear down.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>e process helps to maintain a</p>
<p>right attitude: to win over the Christian brother or sister.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>Jesus explains</p>
<p>that the rst confrontation should be private, then two or three witnesses </p>
<p>should be included (Matt 18:15–16; also Deut 19:15). en, the leadership </p>
<p>should evaluate the situation, and, nally, the whole congregation should </p>
<p>be a witness (Deut 19:16–20; 1 Tim 5:20). Only aer all these stages should </p>
<p>the person be “silenced” or treated as an outsider (Titus 1:11; Matt 18:17).</p>
<p>e use of apotomōs (rigorously) indicates that the problems at Crete </p>
<p>are serious and persistent. ey are serious because they cause people to </p>
<p>turn away from the knowledge of the truth that gives eternal life (Titus </p>
<p>1:14, 1–2). ey are persistent because a gentle explanation is not enough. </p>
<p>But Titus has already shown he has the qualities of compassion and integ-</p>
<p>rity when working with the Christians at Corinth who also had serious and </p>
<p>persistent spiritual problems (2 Cor 7:13–16; 8:16–17).</p>
<p>e opposite of healthy or sound faith is paying attention to Jewish </p>
<p>myths and human commandments (1:14). Mythos (myth) could simply </p>
<p>refer to a “tale, story, narrative,” but, in this context, Paul treats it as “c-</p>
<p>tion,” “legend,” of which the opposite is logos or “historic truth.”</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>e Bible</p>
<p>contrasts it with God’s oikonomia, God’s principles (1 Tim 1:4), and the </p>
<p>truth (2 Tim 4:4; 2 Pet 1:16). e secular Cretan had many myths about </p>
<p>which they were proud, such as about Zeus.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>ey used the myths as bases</p>
<p>for their actions, as “sound” Jews use God’s written revelation as a basis </p>
<p>for actions. Myth, thus, became a “didactic literary genre.”</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>erefore,</p>
<p>possibly the Cretan “Jewish-Christian opponents were creating speculative </p>
<p>doctrines based on stories of ancient OT heroes and using them to lend the </p>
<p>weight of antiquity to certain questionable practices that Paul regarded as </p>
<p>ungodly.”</p>
<p>102</p>
<p> In a similar fashion, Jesus criticized the Pharisees who, aban-</p>
<p>doning God’s command, held on to human tradition (Mark 7:8).</p>
<p>Scholars who agree Paul wrote the Pastoral Letters have suggested </p>
<p>that these Jewish false teachers could have been similar to (a) Essenes, (b) </p>
<p>97. Heb 12:5–6; Rev 3:19; 2 Cor 13:10.</p>
<p>98. See also Gal 6:1–2.</p>
<p>99. LSJ, 1151; TLNT 2:528–33.</p>
