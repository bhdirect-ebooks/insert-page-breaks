<p>authority, sixty was the age to be an elder (m. ’Abot 5:21). Sixty was also the </p>
<p>age for a widow to enter the church’s order of prayer (1 Tim 5:9). </p>
<p>Paul now adds the rst set of qualications for “elders” (if any are </p>
<p>not open to attack, a one-woman man, having faithful children, not in </p>
<p>accusation of wildness or disobedience; 1:6), to be further developed in </p>
<p>a second longer sentence (For it is necessary [for] the overseer to be not </p>
<p>open to attack as God’s steward, not self-pleasing, not prone to anger, not </p>
<p>given to getting drunk, not pugnacious, not fond of shameful gain, but </p>
<p>hospitable, loving what is good, wise, righteous, holy, self-controlled, </p>
<p>holding fast the faithful word according to the teaching . . . ; 1:7–9). Paul </p>
<p>uses the same basic qualications in 1 Timothy 3, but Titus has some dif-</p>
<p>ferent emphases.</p>
