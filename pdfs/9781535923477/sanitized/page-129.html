<p>Avoid Ungodly Talking, BecomeaVesselforGoodWorks(2:14–26)</p>

<p>at all costs. Rather, he is to converse using four means, the rst of which </p>
<p>is to be kind (ēpios; 2:24). Ēpios, when referring to heat and cold, is “mild, </p>
<p>less intense” and in actions, “soothing, assuaging,” as opposed to strong or </p>
<p>angry.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>Eusebius defends the traditional view that 2 Timothy was written</p>
<p>during Paul’s second imprisonment because during the rst Roman im-</p>
<p>prisonment that Luke describes in Acts: “Nero’s disposition was gentler and </p>
<p>it was easier for Paul’s defence on behalf of his views to be received, but as </p>
<p>he advanced towards reckless crime the Apostles were attacked along with </p>
<p>the rest” (Eusebius, Hist. eccl. 2.22). A kind conversation, not one in anger, </p>
<p>is less likely to result in a battle. Moreover, Timothy is to display this kind </p>
<p>attitude to all, not just those with whom he agrees.</p>
<p>Paul uses two synonyms for instruction: didaktikos (2:24) and paideuō </p>
<p>(2:25). Didaktikos, apt in teaching,</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>a quality needed for overseers, was</p>
<p>especially needed in a context of heterodoxy. In a gentle manner, Timothy </p>
<p>was to teach the truth. Timothy, instructed by Paul, was qualied to cause </p>
<p>to learn.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>In teaching, the focus is more on content. Anyone of any age</p>
<p>can choose to learn a skill or new content. (Prisca and Aquila may have </p>
<p>returned to Ephesus to help Timothy in this educational process; 2 Tim </p>
<p>4:19.) In contrast, to guide (paideuō) focuses more on conduct and the re-</p>
<p>lationship of an adult and a minor. Paul describes the law as a pedagogue </p>
<p>(paidagōgos; teacher) that instructs a minor until he or she becomes the </p>
<p>heir who has now received faith.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>But, before, in the middle, and aer these</p>
<p>two concrete words (teach and guide), Paul intersperses three synonyms: </p>
<p>ēpios (kind), anexikakos (patient), and prautēs (gentleness) (2:24–25). If </p>
<p>kind refers to a soothing, conciliatory manner, patient (anexikakos) is even </p>
<p>stronger, referring to holding one’s self rm (anechō) to endure evil or dif-</p>
<p>culties or wrongs (kakos).</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>is is a type of endurance that perseveres in</p>
<p>the faith despite persecution</p>
<p>123</p>
<p> or that perseveres in love with other believ-</p>
<p>ers.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>Of course, Timothy is not to accept or promote falsehood because</p>
<p>the goal is knowledge of truth (2:25), not knowledge of falsehood. Love, </p>
