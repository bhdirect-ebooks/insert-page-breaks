<p>Avoid Anyone Who Causes Division (3:9–11)</p>

<p>But now they were all adopted and reborn as wealthy heirs looking to </p>
<p>the realization of their glorious inheritance (3:3, 5–7). What a marvelous </p>
<p>vision for then and for now! </p>
<p>Paul then summarizes a key principle in this section of his letter and a </p>
<p>key theme in the whole letter: e word is trustworthy; and, concerning </p>
<p>these things, I desire you to maintain strongly, in order that the ones </p>
<p>having believed in God may be careful to stand forth</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>with good deeds;</p>
<p>these things are good and helpful to humans (3:8). Pistos ho logos (the </p>
<p>word is trustworthy) precedes ve key teachings in the Pastoral Letters.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Logos (word) in the Pastoral letters can refer to God’s revelation</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>teachings of faith,</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> but also human teachings,</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> even heterodox ones.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>this context, modied by pistos (trustworthy), Paul refers to authoritative, </p>
<p>accurate teachings or revelations from God expressed in a pithy saying or </p>
<p>summary statement that can be passed on to others as fully reliable. Jo-</p>
<p>sephus also uses this phrase to describe an accurate report or news (Ant. </p>
<p>19.1.16 [132]). Paul emphasizes that Titus should promote this teaching </p>
<p>strongly.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> Although good deeds do not save anyone,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>63</p>
<p>they are helpful for</p>
<p>believers (3:8).</p>
<p>Avoid Anyone Who Causes Division (3:9–11)</p>
<p>In the second major section of the letter (2:1—3:11), Paul encourages Titus </p>
<p>(a) to promote healthy teaching by encouraging godly behavior among the </p>
<p>elders, youth, and slaves (2:1–15); (b) to remind people to live godly lives in </p>
<p>56. Proistēmi, literally, “set over” (LSJ, 1482; ayer, 539), normally refers to leader-</p>
<p>ship. See 1 Tim 5:17 (Spencer 2013). However, this use in Titus 3:8 (and 3:14) may be </p>
<p>similar to the use in Isa 43:24 when God tells the Israelites that they stood before God in </p>
<p>their sins. In contrast, Christians should “stand forth marked by good deeds” (3:8). </p>
<p>57. See 1 Tim 1:15 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>58. 1 Tim 4:5; 6:3; 2 Tim 2:9, 15; 4:2, 15; Titus 1:3; 2:5.</p>
<p>59. 1 Tim 4:6; 5:17; 2 Tim 1:13; Titus 1:9; 2:8.</p>
<p>60. 1 Tim 4:12.</p>
<p>61. 2 Tim 2:17.</p>
<p>62. Scholars are unsure whether the pithy teaching is 3:4(5)–7 (Robertson 1931: 607; </p>
<p>Lock 1924: 155; Fee 1988: 206–7; Mounce 2000: 451 or 3:8b (T<span class="_ _3" />owner <span class="ws1">2006: <span class="_ _1" />144<span class="wsfa">). My <span class="_ _1" />own </span></span></p>
<p>preference is 3:8b because the saying follows a conjunction as in 1 Tim 1:15 and 4:9; in </p>
<p>the other four sayings, the saying most likely follows the phrase pistos ho logos and 3:8b </p>
<p>is more pithy than 3:4–7. </p>
<p>63. See Titus 3:5.</p>
