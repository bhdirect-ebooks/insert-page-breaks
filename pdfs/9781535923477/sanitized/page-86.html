<p>Titus 372</p>
<p>Zenas and Apollos as travelers. Titus has to equip them with everything </p>
<p>they need for the journey (way), which will include nding the right ship, </p>
<p>obtaining provisions, escorting them to the ship, possibly giving them </p>
<p>money for the trip and letters of introduction, and praying for them.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>e next verse serves to reinforce Paul’s exhortation to Titus to help </p>
<p>Zenas and Apollos in their journey, and, as well, serves as an apt summary </p>
<p>for the whole letter: and let our people keep on learning also to stand </p>
<p>forth with good deeds for necessary needs, lest they may be unfruit-</p>
<p>ful (3:14). By following 3:13 with this verse, Paul implies that the church </p>
<p>should join Titus in preparing Zenas and Apollos for travel. Practice in </p>
<p>doing loving actions is a way experientially to learn to do them. is verse </p>
<p>hearkens back to the faithful saying in 3:8.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>Doing good deeds helps other</p>
<p>Christians, helps educate those who do the good deeds, should be limited </p>
<p>to genuine needs, and is a result of one’s faith (3:13–14). e good deeds </p>
<p>they are to do are limited by the phrase for necessary (anankaios) or indis-</p>
<p>pensable needs,</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>not luxuries.</p>
<p>Akarpos is a lovely metaphor (3:14). e faith of believers should have </p>
<p>a “harvest” (karpos) of good deeds. As seeds result in produce or a harvest, </p>
<p>God’s word cast into our hearts</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>should result in a harvest of outward</p>
<p>goodness. e outward deeds demonstrate the inner attitude.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>As Jesus</p>
<p>explained, “from their fruits you will recognize” whether a tree is good or </p>
<p>bad (Matt 7:20; 12:33) and the kingdom of God is for those who “produce </p>
<p>its fruit” (Matt 21:43). Bearing much fruit glories the Father (John 15:8). </p>
<p>erefore, Paul seeks fruit in his converts (Phil 4:17; Titus 3:14).</p>
<p>Final Greetings (3:15)</p>
<p>Paul concludes the letter: All the ones with me greet you. Greet the ones </p>
<p>loving us in faith. Grace be with all of you (3:15). Artemas and Tychicus </p>
<p>(3:12) and others are with Paul. Paul rarely is alone. He may be single, but </p>
<p>he is not solitary. He writes the letter to Titus, but he lets other believers </p>
