<p>2 Timothy 296</p>
<p>before” people, entrusted to them as a deposit, a deposit not to hide but to </p>
<p>reveal to others. e recipients of this message are described in three ways: </p>
<p>(1) humans, who are (2) trustworthy, and (3) able to teach others.</p>
<p>Some commentators want to limit humans, anthrōpos, to men only in </p>
<p>2:2 because they presuppose that the teaching oces are restricted to men </p>
<p>only.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>However, 1 and 2 Timothy have plenty of references where anthrōpos</p>
<p>is clearly generic: prayer for all humans, God desires all humans to be saved, </p>
<p>one mediator between God and humans, God is Savior of all humans, sins </p>
<p>of some people, people of corrupt mind, rich people, no human can see </p>
<p>God, people will love themselves, evil people.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Denitive lexicons dene</p>
<p>anthrōpos as a generic term in the singular and plural.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>e assumption</p>
<p>is that God’s revelation cannot rise above the androcentrism of its culture. </p>
<p>However, if Jesus could rise above the androcentrism of his Jewish culture, </p>
<p>why cannot his disciples rise above the androcentrism of their cultures?</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition, the culture of antiquity was not one culture but many cultures, </p>
<p>some of which allowed women to take leadership.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Paul wanted both women and men to be taught sound words in order </p>
<p>to teach these to others. But, for the important process of accurate trans-</p>
<p>mission, students must have two qualications. ey must be faithful or </p>
<p>trustworthy (2:2).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Moreover, since the goal is not simply self-edication,</p>
<p>such people must also have the gi of teaching and the motivation to teach </p>
<p>others. en they will all be able to join Timothy, Paul, and other believers </p>
<p>in suering, and, if they should die or move away or be arrested for the </p>
<p>faith, the message to join in suering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus </p>
<p>(2:3) will continue.</p>
<p>parathēkē, “deposit,” in 1:12, 14. E.g., Mark 6:41; 8:6–7; Luke 9:16; 10:8; 11:6; Acts 16:34; </p>
<p>1 Cor 10:27. </p>
<p>11. For example, Johnson explains that, although pistois anthrōpos “can be translated </p>
<p>as ‘faithful people,’” he renders it “faithful men,” because the “androcentrism of the Pasto-</p>
<p>rals is so profound and pervasive that a gender-inclusive translation is almost impossible </p>
<p>. . . it actually camouages the true voice of the writing, which is unmistakably that of a </p>
<p>male writing to another male within the Mediterranean culture of antiquity” (1996: 58).</p>
