<p>Teach What Is Consistent with Healthy Doctrine (2:1—3:11)</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>slavery oered opportunities, but ultimately it was a limiting position be-</p>
<p>cause the slave is not free.</p>
<p>us, in the New Testament, slavery is both a positive and a nega-</p>
<p>tive image. Voluntary slavery to a gentle master is the positive image for </p>
<p>Christians who are disciples or “slaves” of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> It is also an ex-</p>
<p>emplary image for humble leadership.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>Many believers are called or call</p>
<p>themselves “slaves” of God.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>However, when people become disciples of</p>
<p>Jesus, no matter their previous status, now they are “beloved” brothers and </p>
<p>sisters and friends (Phlm 16; John 15:14–15), equal to one another (1 Cor </p>
<p>12:13; Gal 3:28; Col 3:11). ey are infused by the Holy Spirit to become </p>
<p>prophets (Acts 2:18). e free become slaves and the slaves become free </p>
<p>(1 Cor 7:21–22). ese were revolutionary ideas. Yet, Paul does not want </p>
<p>to create sudden massive societal revolts. He wants gradual change. us, </p>
<p>Christians are exhorted how to behave in their current societal position (1 </p>
<p>Cor 7:17, 21). Societal change is possible, but acting in a Christ-like man-</p>
<p>ner immediately is most important.</p>
<p>Slavery, because of its limitations, can also have negative connota-</p>
<p>tions. For instance, in Titus, female elders are not to be enslaved to an </p>
<p>intoxicating substance such as wine (2:3). Believers in general are not to be </p>
<p>enslaved to passions and pleasures (3:3). Elsewhere, the New Testament de-</p>
<p>scribes sin as causing slavery or lack of freedom.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>e law can also enslave</p>
<p>(Rom 7:6; Gal 5:1). Pagan gods can enslave (Gal 4:8–9). Household slavery </p>
<p>in the ancient world was very similar to indentured service. Paul wanted </p>
<p>to promote hard work and trustworthiness (Titus 2:10), but also teach that </p>
<p>believers should be moving to freedom both spiritually and societally.</p>
<p>Many of the qualities needed for an elder (1:6–9) are reiterated in the </p>
<p>later lists.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>e opposite of pleasing oneself (authadēs; Titus 1:7) is pleasing</p>
<p>others (euarestos; 2:9). Euarestos (well-pleasing)</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> is a positive term in bibli-</p>
<p>cal literature. For example, Enoch is repeatedly described as so well-pleasing </p>
<p>49. Rom 12:11; 14:18; 16:18; 1 ess 1:9; Rev 1:1; 2:20; 7:3; 19:2, 5; 22:3.</p>
<p>50. Matt 20:26–28; Phil 2:7; 2 Cor 4:5; 2 Tim 2:24; Gal 5:13.</p>
<p>51. E.g., Mary (Luke 1:38, 48), Moses (Rev 15:3), Simeon (Luke 2:29), Paul (Titus 1:1; </p>
<p>Rom 1:1; Phil 1:1; Gal 1:10; Acts 16:17), Timothy (Phil 2:22), James (Jas 1:1), Peter (2 Pet </p>
<p>1:1), Jude (Jude 1), Epaphras (Col 4:12).</p>
<p>52. John 8:34; Gal 5:13; Rom 6:6, 16–20; 7:25; 2 Pet 2:19.</p>
<p>53. See Titus 2:2–10.</p>
<p>54. ayer, 257. See also verb euaresteō.</p>
