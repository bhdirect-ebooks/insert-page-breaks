<p>Proclaim the Word (4:1–6) </p>

<p>and even slapped them (2 Cor 11:4, 20), at Ephesus, healthy teaching, the </p>
<p>truth, would no longer be endured.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>Instead, some would listen to teachers</p>
<p>who scratch their hearing (4:3). Hearing is an important step in the com-</p>
<p>munication and reception of the gospel. Faith comes from hearing.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>people Paul describes are impaired in their hearing.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>ey apparently want</p>
<p>their ears scratched because they itch.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>If someone had sores, they would</p>
<p>itch and want the sores scratched to relieve the unpleasant sensation,</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> </p>
<p>although that scratching would be the worst action they could do. Scratch-</p>
<p>ing would only make the itching worse. Since the sensation of being over-</p>
<p>whelmed with sins and passions could be cured by the truth that brings </p>
<p>greater health, a supercial cure, scratching, just makes the problem worse. </p>
<p>In this case, the scratching is listening to myths (4:4). Mentioned in all </p>
<p>the Pastoral Letters,</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>myths were speculative doctrines based on ctional</p>
<p>stories, not historic truths. ey promoted asceticism and legalism and </p>
<p>concern with genealogies. ese stories could be entertaining.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>they did not prepare the listeners for persevering in persecution and suf-</p>
<p>fering for their faith. </p>
<p>In contrast to these people, Paul gives Timothy four commands: But, </p>
<p>you, continue sober in all, endure hardship, do work of an evangelist, </p>
<p>fulll your ministry (4:5). is is the nal time Paul addresses Timothy </p>
<p>directly as you.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>In some ways these four commands contrast with the</p>
<p>negative characteristics in 4:3–4. Instead of being unhealthy and lacking </p>
<p>perception, Timothy is sober. Instead of merely following his personal </p>
<p>passions, Timothy endures suering. Instead of pursuing falsehood, Timo-</p>
<p>thy promotes truth as an evangelist. Instead of destroying his health, he </p>
<p>maintains it by using his spiritual gi to carry out his ministry fully. ese </p>

<p>32. Knēthō is a participle, passive or middle voice. e passive signies “to itch,” but </p>
<p>the middle “to scratch” (LSJ, 964). Lock (1924: 113): “having itching ears, and desiring </p>
<p>to get the itching checked,” I think ts better in context than “being pleased, having their </p>
<p>ears tickled by each new teacher.”</p>
