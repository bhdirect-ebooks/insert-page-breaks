<p>Titus 120</p>
<p>rmly to the trustworthy message they were taught (Titus 1:9). is is the </p>
<p>godly truth proclaimed by Paul (not the circumcision party)—his healthy </p>
<p>teaching (Titus 1:1–3, 10; 2:1).</p>
<p>Overseers/elders must be able to do two things: (1) encourage and (2) </p>
<p>reprove: in order that (s)he may also be able to encourage healthy teach-</p>
<p>ing and to reprove those who are opposing (1:9).</p>
<p>64</p>
<p> While they encour-</p>
<p>age healthy teaching, they also discourage those who undermine healthy </p>
<p>teaching. Both encouragement and reproving will come up again in the </p>
<p>letter for the elder and for Titus (1:13; 2:6, 15). Here explicitly Titus is re-</p>
<p>minded that there are some people at Crete who oppose (antilegō) healthy </p>
<p>teaching.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>ey are not obedient to the truth. Paul had been opposed before</p>
<p>by some of his Jewish compatriots (Acts 13:45; 28:19), as had been John the </p>
<p>Baptist (Luke 2:34).</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>erefore, the overseers/elders are to be people who</p>
<p>will work with Titus while he is there (Titus 3:12) to facilitate true teaching.</p>
<p>Sound Teaching (1:10–14) </p>
<p>Paul le Titus behind to set straight what was remaining to be done by </p>
<p>appointing godly elders in every city (1:5–9). Why was this necessary? For </p>
<p>there are many disobedient, empty talkers, and deceivers, especially the </p>
<p>ones from the circumcision, who it is necessary to silence, who overturn </p>
<p>whole households teaching what is not necessary because of shameful </p>
<p>gain (1:10–11). Paul begins by listing three negative qualities that many </p>
<p>people have at Crete: disobedience (anypotaktos), empty talk (mataiolo-</p>
<p>gos), and deception (phrenapatēs) (1:10). Children (1:6), and certainly the </p>
<p>elders themselves, should not be people unable to subject themselves to </p>
<p>healthy teaching (anypotaktos, 1:9; “knowledge of truth,” 1:1). Does empty </p>
<p>talk refer simply to someone who is verbose (“a windbag”),</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> or is it a stron-</p>
<p>ger term? Mataiologia (mataios, empty; and logia/legō, to speak)</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> is syn-</p>
<p>onymous with heterodoxy, myths, and endless genealogies that promote </p>
<p>speculations, teaching what is wrong in contrast to God’s “household man-</p>
<p>agement” whose goal is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and </p>
<p>64. Xenophon also understands “overseers” to be guardians of the laws . . . commend-</p>
<p>ing the law-abiding and punishing law-breakers (Oec. 9.14).</p>
<p>65. See Titus 1:13.</p>
<p>66. God had been opposed (Rom 10:21; Jude 11) and, of course, even Jesus’ own </p>
<p>people rejected him (John 1:11).</p>
