<p>Fusing the Horizons: e Place of Education 32</p>
<p>be ﬂexible, compassionate, alive? Paul uses the latter image in the Pastoral </p>
<p>Letters.</p>
<p>Many across the globe are attracted to the awesomeness of the Triune </p>
<p>God and the good news. However, they are not always discipled, educated, </p>
<p>and helped to mature. Sometimes it is the fault of the new believer. They </p>
<p>think they now own a card that they can show God and others: “The bearer </p>
<p>of this card will receive grace no matter what they say or do.” Sometimes </p>
<p>it is the fault of the evangelist: “I bring them in. God takes care of them </p>
<p>from now on.” However, such attitudes make the new believer like a newborn </p>
<p>who is cast out into the street to live on its own resources. Sometimes it is </p>
<p>the fault of the church: “Just come to services to worship, bring your body, </p>
<p>bring your money, take your seat.” The new believers may grow a bit, but </p>
<p>they remain infants their whole lives. Sometimes the church does not have </p>
<p>enough people to disciple the new believers. They may be busy with other </p>
<p>matters or simply disorganized. The Pastoral Letters reiterate the importance </p>
<p>of educating people in the truth, even as God had insisted on education in the </p>
<p>old covenant. God’s law was regularly to be taught in the home by the adults </p>
<p>and in the community by the priests and before the whole assembly by the </p>
<p>religious leaders (e.g., Deut 31:12–13a). </p>
