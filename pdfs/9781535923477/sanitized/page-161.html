<p>in that city.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> Paul adds: And Tychicus I sent into Ephesus (4:12).</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>As in</p>
<p>Crete, Tychicus’ presence allows another of Paul’s coworkers to leave.</p>
<p>Paul continues with a further reason he wants Timothy to hasten to </p>
<p>Rome: When you come, bring the cloak which I le in Troas with Car-</p>
<p>pus, and the books, especially the parchments (4:13). Paul here assumes </p>
<p>Timothy will come to Rome. ese details have impressed many com-</p>
<p>mentators as the type of simple details no forger would ever have.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>Paul</p>
<p>wants two items, something to warm the body and something to activate </p>
<p>the mind. Even though Paul expects the nal outcome not to go well, he </p>
<p>still wants to keep active. e cloak (phailonēs) is a thick upper garment,</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and is a solid reason why Paul wants Timothy to come before winter (4:21). </p>
<p>Paul le this heavy cloak in Troas, the important seaport between Asia and </p>
<p>Europe in Mysia in northwest Asia Minor on the Aegean Sea where Paul </p>
<p>received his vision to go to Macedonia.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>Aer being released from the rst</p>
<p>Roman imprisonment, Paul must have returned to Troas, where he le his </p>
<p>cloak with Carpus.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> Possibly, Paul had to leave Troas in haste.</p>
<p>94. Hendricksen 1957: 321. Lock (1924:117) suggests Mark was useful for “personal </p>
<p>service in prison, or for missions to the city, or for help in worship,” “as a comforter in </p>
<p>trouble.” Fee (1988: 294) suggests Mark provided “at least ministry to his personal needs” </p>
<p>(also Kelly 1963: 214) but Marshall (1999: 817) responds that “one does not summon an </p>
<p>experienced missionary simply to be a valet.” Towner (2006: 626) summarizes Mark’s </p>
<p>role as “ongoing ministry in the Roman church” or “to assist in taking the mission into </p>
<p>new parts.”</p>

<p>97. LSJ, 1912. Kelly describes the cloak as a “large, sleeveless outer garment, made of </p>
<p>a single piece of heavy material, with a hole in the middle through which the head was </p>
<p>passed,” “used for protection against cold and rain” (1963: 215). Towner adds that it was </p>
<p>expensive, made from goat hair, hide, or coarse wool (2006: 628). e phailonēs is not </p>
<p>the threadbare cloak (tribōn) worn by the Stoic or Cynic philosopher or a fancy cloak </p>
<p>(Arrian, Epict. diss. 3.23 [35]; 4.8 [15, 34]; LSJ, 1817).</p>
<p>98. Trōas is a contraction of Trōias (“Trojan”; LSJ, 1831–32). Alexandria Troas was </p>
<p>near ancient Troy. It was founded by Antigonus, one of the successors of Alexander the </p>
<p>Great, and it became a Roman colony. Strabo describes it as “one of the notable cities </p>
<p>of the world” (Geogr. 13.1.26 [C593]). In two days Paul and his coworkers (Timothy, </p>
<p>Luke, and Silas) sailed from Troas to Neapolis (Acts 16:8–11). Paul traveled to and from </p>
<p>Macedonia through Troas also during the third missionary journey (Acts 20:5–13; 2 Cor </p>
<p>2:12–13). By this time, a Christian community was already established that met the rst </p>
<p>of the week. At Troas, Paul talked through the night (when Eutychus fell asleep from a </p>
<p>window).</p>
<p>99. Karpos, literally, refers to “fruit,” usually “fruits of the earth,” such as corn (LSJ, </p>
<p>879). Traditionally, Carpus became bishop of Beroea in race (Brownrigg 1971: 55; </p>
