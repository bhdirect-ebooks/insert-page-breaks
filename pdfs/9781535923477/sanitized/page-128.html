<p>2 Timothy 2114</p>
<p>passions and pursues helpful virtues, he regularly appeals to the Lord for </p>
<p>help in growth in these four virtues. For, ultimately, “everyone who calls on </p>
<p>the name of the Lord will be saved” (Rom 10:13; Joel 2:32). In 1 Timothy 2:1, </p>
<p>Paul describes several dierent types of prayer. All of them may be found </p>
<p>in 2 Timothy. Second Timothy 2:22 and 1:3–4 contain requests: Paul longs </p>
<p>to see Timothy and exhorts Timothy to call on the Lord. Paul intercedes </p>
<p>for Onesiphorus’ household in 1:16, 18. He continually thanks God (1:3), </p>
<p>and he asks the Lord to bless Timothy (4:22). In prayer, Paul too serves as a </p>
<p>model for Timothy. But, the basis of the prayer must be a clean heart. Paul </p>
<p>had previously summarized Timothy’s commission as “love from a clean </p>
<p>heart and a good conscience and genuine faith.”</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>If within one’s inward</p>
<p>self, one prays with evil intentions, one’s prayers will not be answered. Paul </p>
<p>describes his own prayers as done with a “clean conscience” (1:3). </p>
<p>Temptation can come from one’s strong passions (2:22), but they </p>
<p>can also come from external sources: and keep on averting the foolish </p>
<p>and non-instructive arguments, knowing that they give birth to battles </p>
<p>(2:23). In 2:16, Paul had warned Timothy to keep on avoiding (periistēmi) </p>
<p>“godless empty talk” because ungodliness would spread. Now, he adds to </p>
<p>that warning, to keep on averting, declining, or refusing (paraiteomai) ar-</p>
<p>guments or disputes that lead to spiritual error.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>Disputes can be caused</p>
<p>by a search for the truth. But, these disputes are foolish and non-instruc-</p>
<p>tive. Non-instructive arguments is the opposite of what Timothy is to do </p>
<p>in 2:25. ese arguments do not seek to guide, like the daily instruction and </p>
<p>supervision of conduct of a minor, as God’s grace instructs.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p> ese argu-</p>
<p>ments, like the “old women’s myths” are neither instructive nor edifying.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Arguments that do not search for the truth and for guidance eventually </p>
<p>give birth to battles (machē; 2:23).</p>
<p>Paul continues the imagery (2:21) of the household slave with a mas-</p>
<p>ter: But it is necessary the Lord’s slave not to battle, but to be kind before </p>
<p>all, apt in teaching, patient, giving guidance in gentleness to the ones </p>
<p>opposing oneself, whether perhaps God may grant to them repentance </p>
<p>into knowledge of truth (2:24–25). Timothy is to become involved in con-</p>
<p>versations with those with whom he disagrees, but in a dierent manner. </p>
<p>He is not to battle,</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>as in armed combat aiming to destroy his enemies</p>
<p>113. See 1 Tim 1:5 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>114. See Titus 3:9.</p>
<p>115. See Titus 2:12.</p>
<p>116. See 1 Tim 4:7 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>117. Machomai, “to battle” (2:24), is the verb form of machē, “battle” (2:23).</p>
