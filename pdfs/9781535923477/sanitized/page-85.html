<p>Conclusion (3:12–15)</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>Apollos, having similar interests, both being learned men, probably made </p>
<p>like-minded companions. Zenas is only mentioned here in the Bible.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>He</p>
<p>was a lawyer (“learned in the law”) either Jewish or Gentile. One lawyer </p>
<p>(nomikos) is mentioned in the Septuagint (Eleazar, a priest in ancestry, but </p>
<p>a lawyer by profession [4 Macc 5:4]), more in the New Testament. Some </p>
<p>Jewish lawyers had tested and questioned Jesus’ teachings and authority </p>
<p>and, thus, Jesus had some strong criticism for them.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>Zenas, though, is a</p>
<p>lawyer who served God’s kingdom as one of Paul’s colleagues in ministry.</p>
<p>Apollos,</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>a native of Alexandria, Egypt, was called “learned” by Luke</p>
<p>(an educated man himself) and was gied in teaching and bold, charis-</p>
<p>matic rhetorical speaking. He was eective in speaking as a Jew to other </p>
<p>Jews.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>Even though the church at Corinth created a competition between</p>
<p>the leadership of Paul and Apollos,</p>
<p>103</p>
<p> Paul never shows any resentment to-</p>
<p>ward Apollos. He even is willing to send him back to Corinth (although </p>
<p>Apollos himself is not willing to return at that time [1 Cor 16:12]). Paul </p>
<p>sees that Apollos builds on Paul’s own ministry: Paul “plants” and Apollos </p>
<p>“waters” as together they work on God’s “eld” (1 Cor 3:6–9).</p>
<p>Why were Zenas and Apollos in Crete? Did they bring Paul’s letter </p>
<p>to Titus at Crete</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>or had they already been (or will they stay) at Crete for</p>
<p>a while ministering alongside Titus? We cannot be sure. However, their </p>
<p>presence at Crete would be very helpful since the heterodox teachers were </p>
<p>raising many questions about the use of the law and especially questions </p>
<p>about the place of the Old Testament law in the Christian life (1:10, 14; </p>
<p>3:9). ey could help Titus, a Gentile, in addressing the legal and Jewish </p>
<p>questions raised by the church in Crete. </p>
<p>But now it is time for Titus to exert his own eort and organizational </p>
<p>gis to help them go on their way (2 Cor 8:17; Titus 3:13). Paul wants Titus </p>
<p>to place high importance and exert much eort (diligently)</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>in helping</p>
<p>99. His name is related to Zeus and is probably an abbreviation of Zēnodōros, “gi </p>
<p>of Zeus” (Kohlenberger 1995: 394–95; Robertson 1934: 172). According to tradition, </p>
<p>he became bishop of Diospolis or Lydda (Lock 1924: 158; Baring-Gould 1898: 10:397).</p>
<p>100. Matt 22:35; Luke 10:25; 11:45–52.</p>
<p>101. Apollōs may be short for Apollōnios, Apollodōros, or Apollōnidēs (BDAG, 116; Rob-</p>
<p>ertson 1934: 172, 189).</p>
<p>102. Acts 18:24–28. Some scholars think he wrote Hebrews (Farrar 1883: 186–88).</p>
<p>103. 1 Cor 1:11–12; 3:3–4, 21–23.</p>
<p>104. Zahn 2: 49; Towner 2006: 801; Fee 1988: 214–15. </p>
<p>105. Spoudaiōs and spoudaizō in Titus 3:12 and 13 are used similarly in Gal 2:10; Eph </p>
<p>4:3; Phil 2:28; 1 ess 2:17; 2 Tim 2:15; 4:9; Heb 4:11; 2 Pet 1:10.</p>
