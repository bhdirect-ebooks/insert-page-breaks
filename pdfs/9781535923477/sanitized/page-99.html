<p>Timothy Should Not Be Ashamed to Suer (1:3—2:13)</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>also have self-control (sōphronismos) (which Timothy will also need if he </p>
<p>is to ee youthful passions; 2:22). is is the same quality required of the </p>
<p>women at Ephesus (1 Tim 2:9, 15).</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> ese three military qualities (fearless-</p>
<p>ness, strength, self-control) are still insucient in themselves. ey must </p>
<p>be combined with love (agapē),</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>because Paul and Timothy do not ght</p>
<p>a physical battle, but a spiritual one. e aim of the order is love,</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>a love</p>
<p>which comes from Christ Jesus (1 Tim 1:14).</p>
<p>Join in Suering (1:8–12)</p>
<p>Paul concludes with direct exhortations to Timothy: erefore, do not be-</p>
<p>gin to become ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor of me, his pris-</p>
<p>oner (1:8a). e aorist subjunctive prohibition suggests that from Paul’s </p>
<p>perspective Timothy is not yet ashamed of Paul.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Paul had previously</p>
<p>described Timothy as a model of someone who lives a costly life (1 Cor </p>
<p>4:9–17).</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>But, Paul is concerned that Timothy could desert him too. Jesus</p>
<p>challenged the crowd and his disciples to deny themselves, take up their </p>
<p>crosses, and follow him, assuring them that he will be ashamed of those </p>
<p>who are ashamed of him and his words (Mark 8:38; Luke 9:26). Witness-</p>
<p>ing in behalf of Jesus is worth the diculties because Jesus gives life and </p>
<p>salvation. Paul had said in 1 Timothy 1:12 that he is not ashamed because </p>
<p>of whom he trusts.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>Onesiphorus’ household also modeled believers not</p>
<p>ashamed of being identied with a prisoner (1:16–17). In contrast, other </p>
<p>believers appeared to have le Paul, possibly because they were ashamed of </p>
<p>Paul or fearful of their own safety (4:10, 16).</p>
<p>e opposite of being ashamed of Jesus and Jesus’ believers is to join in </p>
<p>suering for the gospel according to God’s power (1:8b). If Jesus is a cru-</p>
<p>cied Messiah (1 Cor 1:23) whose death on the cross was a shameful way to </p>
<p>die in its time, how can the followers of this Messiah not suer diculties </p>
<p>32. See 1 Tim 2:15 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>33. e four qualities are described in a polysyndeton (using a conjunction between </p>
<p>each one), thus, equal in importance.</p>
<p>34. See 1 Tim 1:5; 4:12; 6:11 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>35. e aorist subjunctive suggests the prohibition of a thing not yet done (Robertson </p>
<p>1934: 851–53). Twenty-seven percent of the uses of epaischynomai (ashamed) in the NT </p>
<p>occur in 2 Tim (which is only .89 percent of the NT) showing how important this topic </p>
<p>is in 2 Tim.</p>
<p>36. See Spencer 1989.</p>
<p>37. See also Rom 1:16; Phil 1:20.</p>
