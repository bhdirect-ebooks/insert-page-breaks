<p>Teach What Is Consistent with Healthy Doctrine (2:1—3:11)</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>an elder in Ephesus,</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>nevertheless, Paul repeats it as an important quality</p>
<p>for male elders and young women and men. Although one would expect </p>
<p>this word-family to be more frequent in the New Testament, it occurs only </p>
<p>sixteen times, ten of which are in the Pastoral Letters.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>e basic idea in</p>
<p>wisdom is soundness or wholeness of mind, as the opposite of lunacy.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>Attic especially, it refers to having control over the sensual desires, having </p>
<p>moderation and self-control. e elder who keeps away from intoxication </p>
<p>and dwells on godly attributes (Titus 2:2) will then be able to have a ma-</p>
<p>ture mind directed by self-control.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>In the New Testament, this quality is</p>
<p>necessary for all, male and female, young and old. It is a prerequisite to </p>
<p>prayer (1 Pet 4:7). Unfortunately, some translators will chose an aspect of </p>
<p>wisdom to highlight when addressing particular groups of people. Mature </p>
<p>men are to be “prudent” (Titus 2:2; NRSV) and “reasonable” (Acts 26:25; </p>
<p>NIV), whereas women are to have “propriety, decency, modesty” (1 Tim </p>
<p>2:9, 15; NRSV, NIV) and the young are to have “self-control, self-discipline” </p>
<p>(Titus 2:5–6; 2 Tim 1:7; NRSV, NIV). Of course, context aects the aspect </p>
<p>of a word a translator might want to emphasize, but the sex or age should </p>
<p>not limit meaning because then readers fail to see the continuity of virtue </p>
<p>desired for all men and women, younger and older, indicated by the use of </p>
<p>the same word-family for all. </p>
<p>If sōphrōn has to do with soundness of mind, hygiainō has to do with </p>
<p>soundness of body. Both have to do with good health. e male elder has </p>
<p>“to be in good health” when it comes to faith, love, and perseverance (2:2). </p>
<p>Healthy or “sound” faith has already been mentioned as a goal in this </p>
<p>letter for all.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>e three attributes of faith, love, and perseverance occur</p>
<p>together once in each Pastoral Letter, referring in Titus to the elders (2:2), </p>
<p>in 1 Timothy to Timothy (6:11), and in 2 Timothy to Paul (3:10). Faith and </p>
<p>love are two of three qualities that persist longer than any spiritual gi (1 </p>
<p>Cor 13:8–13). e content of faith has been summarized in 1 Tim 3:16. But </p>
<p>15. See Titus 1:8 and 1 Tim 3:2 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>16. 62.5 percent of the total references, six (37.5 percent) in Titus to sōphrōn, </p>
<p>sōphronismos, sōphroneō, sōphronizō, sōphronōs, and sōphrosynē.</p>
<p>17. E.g., Mark 5:15; Luke 8:35; 2 Cor 5:13.</p>
<p>18. Sōphroneō comes from sōs (safe and sound, alive and well or whole) and phrēn </p>
<p>(the midri, the seat of the passions, and seat of the mental faculties, especially will and </p>
<p>purpose; LSJ, 1750–52, 1954). us, sōs and phrēn combine into “wisdom” (sōphrōn), </p>
<p>wholeness of mind and passion, where one can do the good that one wills to do; BDAG, </p>
<p>987.</p>
<p>19. See Titus 1:13.</p>
