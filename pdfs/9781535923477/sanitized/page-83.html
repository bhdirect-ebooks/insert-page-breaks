<p>Conclusion (3:12–15)</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>the winter (3:12). Titus’ plans are indenite. ey depend on (a) when </p>
<p>Artemas or Tychicus reaches Crete; (b) when Titus’ work is completed at </p>
<p>Crete; and (c) the time of year and sailing conditions. Where is Paul now? </p>
<p>Possibly he is in Macedonia</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>and he will hike (or sail around the Gulf of</p>
<p>Corinth) to Nicopolis. Paul wants Titus to meet him at Nicopolis before or </p>
<p>aer the winter season, when the west winds begin to blow. Because sail-</p>
<p>ing on the open sea was so dangerous, no one sailed from mid-November </p>
<p>to mid-March.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>Travelers were warned of weather hazards beginning in</p>
<p>mid-September until mid-February. us, Paul would plan to visit key </p>
<p>churches (1 Cor 16:6) or cities during these times. A good winter harbor </p>
<p>was free from sudden, frequent, and violent winds.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>erefore, if Titus,</p>
<p>Artemas, and/or Tychicus are to travel safely, they need to sail between </p>
<p>the six months of April through September. e trip between Crete and </p>
<p>Nicopolis might take 10 days up to a month.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>Several ancient cities at that time were called Nicopolis.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>Most likely,</p>
<p>this Nicopolis is in Achaia (Greece),</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>facing the Sea of Adria in Illyricum</p>
<p>(Rom 15:19), not far from Dalmatia (2 Tim 4:10), because of its location </p>
<p>and size. It is “by far the most important and famous city of this name.”</p>
<p>87</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was founded by Octavian Augustus to celebrate his victory</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>over Mark</p>
<p>Antony at the Bay of Actium in 31 BC. Herod the “Great” built many public </p>
<p>buildings there for the inhabitants (Josephus, Ant. 16.5 [147]). </p>
<p>Paul continues his ministry strategy of sending his coworkers to dif-</p>
<p>ferent places depending on their spiritual gis and the needs of dierent </p>
<p>churches.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>Titus’ organizational and peacemaking gis will, most likely,</p>
<p>next be needed at Nicopolis.</p>
