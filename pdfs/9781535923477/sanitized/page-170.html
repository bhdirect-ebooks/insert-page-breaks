<p>2 Timothy 4156</p>
<p>Miletus, being sick (4:20). Possibly, they had begun to accompany Paul on </p>
<p>his nal journey to Rome. Erastus (“beloved”)</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>probably is the same one</p>
<p>mentioned in Acts 19, whom Paul sent ahead with Timothy from Ephesus </p>
<p>to Macedonia. Described as “the ones ministering with” Paul (19:22), Eras-</p>
<p>tus and Timothy are coworkers, Paul sending them ahead to Macedonia to </p>
<p>prepare the churches for the collection for the Jerusalem Christians oer-</p>
<p>ing and to meet Titus there.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Is this Erastus the same mentioned in Romans 16:23, a steward (oiko-</p>
<p>nomos) of a city? A “steward” could be a manager of a household or here of </p>
<p>a city-state, who would oversee the property, receive and pay bills, plan ex-</p>
<p>penditures, apportion food, and oversee people.</p>
<p>150</p>
<p>A good manager would</p>
<p>be trustworthy. If the Erastus of Acts had been in Ephesus with Paul and </p>
<p>was traveling to Macedonia, how could he be functioning about the same </p>
<p>time as manager of another city? Such an ocial would not be able to leave </p>
<p>his city for a long period.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p>If Erastus is the same Erastus discovered in a</p>
<p>rst-century inscription on a marble in Corinth (“Erastus, commissioner </p>
<p>for public works, laid this pavement at his own expense”),</p>
<p>152</p>
<p> then the Eras-</p>
<p>tus mentioned in 2 Timothy 4:20 would have remained in his hometown, </p>
<p>Corinth.</p>
<p>Trophimus and Tychicus were from Asia.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>ey, along with Timothy</p>
<p>and others, had accompanied Paul from Achaia through Macedonia, Troas, </p>
<p>and Miletus to Caesarea and Jerusalem to help guard the collection for the </p>
<p>Jews in Jerusalem and, as well, to represent their churches and provinces </p>
<p>(Rom 15:25–27). Miletus, where he was le sick, is a city right on the Ae-</p>
<p>gean Sea, about thirty miles south from Ephesus (Acts 20:15, 17). Founded </p>
<p>by Cretans, it was one of the oldest and most important cities in Ionia. With </p>
<p>four harbors, it was an active and prominent harbor city. Jews lived there </p>
<p>free to celebrate their festivals. e city had a synagogue.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>148. ayer, 247.</p>
<p>149. Paul then writes 2 Cor together with Timothy from Macedonia (2 Cor 1:1; 9:2 </p>
<p>[AD 56–57]; Spencer 1998b: 63).</p>
<p>150. See Titus 1:7.</p>
<p>151. Possibly Romans was written from Philippi in Macedonia during Acts 20:6 </p>
<p>(Spencer 1998b: 63–65).</p>
<p>152. Craneld 1983: 2:807.</p>

<p>tus and Ephesus are the “most famous” Ionian cities); Josephus, Ant. 14.10.21 (244–46).</p>
