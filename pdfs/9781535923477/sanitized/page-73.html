<p>Live Godly Lives in the World (3:1–8)</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>anoētos, a nonbeliever, as in John 3:36: “Whoever believes in the Son has </p>
<p>eternal life; whoever disobeys the Son will not see life.”</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>It is a characteristic</p>
<p>of those in the Cretan circumcision party (Titus 1:16). Planaō (planē, led </p>
<p>astray) has a basic idea of someone who wanders about aimlessly or roams </p>
<p>hither and thither, without a sense of proper direction,</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> as Joseph did look-</p>
<p>ing for his brothers (Gen 37:15) or as sheep might wander (Matt 18:12). </p>
<p>Metaphorically, it can refer to those who “wander” away from the truth (Jas </p>
<p>5:19) or leave the straight road and go astray (2 Pet 2:15). </p>
<p>Possibly with these words (3:3a) Paul alludes to his previous state as </p>
<p>a Jew who had rejected Jesus as Messiah and therefore persecuted Chris-</p>
<p>tians.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> He was foolish or lacked understanding (anoētos). He was disobe-</p>
<p>dient (apeithēs) to the truth. He was led astray or deceived (planaō) by the </p>
<p>teaching he had gotten. But, he turned his life around when he chose to be </p>
<p>obedient to Jesus in the vision on the road to Damascus (Acts 26:19). </p>
<p>e next phrase (enslaved to passions [epithymia] and manifold </p>
<p>pleasures [ēdonē]; 3:3) hearkens back to earlier references in the letter. Fe-</p>
<p>male elders are encouraged not to be enslaved to much wine (2:3). God’s </p>
<p>grace teaches believers to “deny” alluring passions.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>In the same way that</p>
<p>addictive intoxicating substances, such as wine and beer, can enslave us, </p>
<p>other objects can elicit strong feelings and passions from us, enslaving us </p>
<p>as well. e wrong kind of pleasures can keep people from persevering in </p>
<p>the Christian life. People can receive God’s word, but as time goes on are </p>
<p>overwhelmed by worries and riches and “pleasures of life,” thereby not ma-</p>
<p>turing (Luke 8:14). Pleasures (ēdonē) may be similar to the coveting aspect </p>
<p>of passions (epithymia). Because someone wants something, the person </p>
<p>will quarrel and ght for it and even pray for it. But pleasures are a wrong </p>
<p>basis for prayer (Jas 4:1–3). Pleasures can result in wild and self-indulgent </p>
<p>debauchery (2 Pet 2:13).</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>us, an important aspect of humility (3:2) is</p>
<p>being satised with what one has.</p>
<p>Next, the Cretans are to remember that they used to live in wickedness </p>
<p>(kakia) and envy (3:3). Kakia can refer in a general way to evil intentions </p>
