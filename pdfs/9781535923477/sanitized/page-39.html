<p>and are not ashamed of it” (Philops. 3).</p>

<p>e Jews who were overturning</p>
<p>whole households might have been promoting their Cretan heritage. And, </p>
<p>they did have many things to be proud of, as the earlier advanced Minoan </p>
<p>civilization. Also, the Cretans were famous for their past laws. In Plato’s </p>
<p>dialogue about ideal governments, he includes a representative of Crete </p>
<p>(Clinias, along with a representative of Sparta-Megillus of Lacedaemon, </p>
<p>and, of course, himself as the “Athenian Stranger”). Cretans claimed that </p>
<p>Zeus gave his laws directly to King Minos.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>e laws of the Cretans were</p>
<p>held in “superlatively high repute among all the Hellenes.”</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>Nevertheless,</p>
<p>there was an underside to Crete.</p>
<p>To what is Paul referring when he agrees with the accusation of evil </p>
<p>beasts (thērion) and idle bellies (gastēr [1:12])? For ancient Greeks, thēr </p>
<p>referred to a beast of prey, such as a lion or a monster.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>A thērion (a “little</p>
<p>animal”) oen referred to a “wild animal,” including even elephants.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>the Bible, thērion is used as early as Genesis 1 to refer to animals that were </p>
<p>not four-footed animals (cattle) or reptiles or birds.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>ey were brought</p>
<p>for protection by pairs into the ark (Gen 6:20; 7:14). Some were unclean.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sometimes the word referred to all wild animals (Lev 17:13; Jas 3:7). e </p>
<p>snake was one example (Gen 3:2; Acts 28:4–5). us, thērion generally re-</p>
<p>ferred to animals, especially wild animals. e adjective evil limits the type </p>
<p>of animal. is would be a harmful animal. God mentions four means of </p>
<p>judgment: sword, famine, pestilence, and evil beasts/animals (Ezek 14:21). </p>
<p>us, an evil beast is an animal harmful to humans or domesticated ani-</p>
<p>mals.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>Sometimes, people are described as living like “wild animals,” or</p>
<p>being treated as animals.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>Paul’s reference, of course, is clearly a negative</p>
<p>metaphor. Probably he would understand “evil beasts” in its Old Testament </p>
<p>83. Lucian repeats this illustration in Sacr. 10.</p>
<p>84. Plato, Leg. I.624A, 630B; Diodorus 5.78. 3. </p>
<p>85. Plato, Leg. I.631B; Polybius, Hist. 6.7.43.1. e Cretans also claimed to have dis-</p>
<p>covered the use of re and the metals copper and iron, the domestication of sheep, the </p>
<p>making of honey, the art of shooting with the bow, the making of swords and helmets, </p>
<p>and the war-dance (Diodorus 5.64.5; 65.3–4; 74.5).</p>

<p>might (2 Macc 5:27; 10:6). Some Jewish martyrs were dragged like beasts (3 Macc 4:9).</p>
