<p>he ascribes that same glory back to God (4:18). Jesus has such glory and his </p>
<p>gospel has this glory.</p>

<p>Greetings (4:19–22)</p>
<p>Paul concludes his letter by sending nal greetings to coworkers who are </p>
<p>with or near Timothy. He asks Timothy to Greet Prisca and Aquila and </p>
<p>the household of Onesiphorus (4:19). ese two households are dedi-</p>
<p>cated to promoting God’s reign. Prisca (her nickname in Roman style is </p>
<p>lengthened to Priscilla) and Aquila are mentioned several times in the </p>
<p>New Testament.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p>Aquila is a Jew from Pontus (near the Black Sea). Some</p>
<p>have theorized that Aquila (and probably Prisca) had been in Jerusalem </p>
<p>for Pentecost (Acts 2:9–10).</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>ey had been living in Rome, Italy, and</p>
<p>when Emperor Claudius in AD 49 had thrown the Jews out of Rome for </p>
<p>their quarrels about the Christ,</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>they brought their tentmaking business</p>
<p>to Corinth in Achaia, an important trade center. Paul stayed with them over </p>
<p>a year and a half, becoming partners in tentmaking with them (Acts 18:5). </p>
<p>Together in Corinth in AD 50–51, they joined Paul when he moved on, ar-</p>
<p>riving in Ephesus in Asia around 51–52. Aerwards, Paul traveled back to </p>
<p>his home church in Antioch (Acts 18:18–22). In Ephesus, about a year later, </p>
<p>Prisca and Aquila more accurately expounded to Apollos Christian doc-</p>
<p>trine, in particular about baptism.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>During their stay in Ephesus, Aquila</p>
<p>134. See Titus 1:2; 2:13; 1 Tim 1:11; 3:16. Forty-six percent of the references to doxa </p>
<p>(glory) in the NT are used by Paul. A similar blessing for God also occurs in 1 Tim 1:17; </p>
<p>Rom 11:36; 16:27; Gal 1:5; Phil 4:20.</p>
<p>135. Twice Aquila’s name precedes Priscilla’s and four times Priscilla’s name precedes </p>
<p>Aquila’s. Luke presents Aquila’s name rst in a formal way (Acts 18:2). He always de-</p>
<p>scribes the wife as “Priscilla,” her nickname, showing his aection for her, but aerwards </p>
<p>mentions her name rst as the predominant one in this teaching and pastoring couple </p>
<p>(Acts 18:18–19, 24–28). Paul, like Luke, usually mentions her rst, but calls her the </p>
<p>more formal “Prisca” to give dignity to her as his teaching coworker (1 Cor 16:19; Rom </p>
<p>16:3; 2 Tim 4:19). Some later translations have reversed the order of their names in Acts </p>
<p>18:26 but the earliest best quality Greek manuscripts have “Priscilla and Aquila” (see the </p>
<p>fourth-century codices Sinaiticus and Vaticanus).</p>
<p>136. Some scholars think Prisca was a Gentile. However, unlike Timothy’s parents </p>
<p>who are explicitly named as interreligious, Prisca is not said to be Gentile. Intermarriage </p>
<p>between Jews and Gentiles was highly disproved since it was against Jewish laws and </p>
<p>customs (Josephus, Ant. 18.9.5 [345]). us, if Prisca was a Gentile, I think, Luke would </p>
<p>have mentioned it.</p>
<p>137. Acts 18:2; Suetonius, Claudius 25.4.</p>
<p>138. Acts 18:24–26; Spencer 1985: 107. </p>
