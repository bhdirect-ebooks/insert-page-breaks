<p>and actions,</p>

<p>or it can serve as a synonym for a specic type of evil, a</p>
<p>ramication of a life not serving the Creator.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Paul is not referring to one</p>
<p>sinful act, but to a way of life (diagō, 3:3).</p>
<p>Finally, the result of their former way of life is being hated and hating </p>
<p>one another. Paul uses two synonyms for hatred (stygētos and miseō; 3:3). </p>
<p>A Stygian was “of the nether world,” pertaining to the River Styx, a river </p>
<p>of the underworld, whose waters were thought poisonous.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>For instance,</p>
<p>high priest Jason, who had an unhappy end to his life, accused by King </p>
<p>Aretas, eeing from city to city, pursued by all, an enemy of his country and </p>
<p>countrymen, was “hated as a forsaker of the laws” (2 Macc 5:8). Beginning </p>
<p>with lack of understanding, one chooses not to believe, is led astray, becom-</p>
<p>ing enslaved to passions and pleasures. Such dissolute, addictive masters </p>
<p>lead to a way of life that is wicked and full of jealousy, bringing out hatred </p>
<p>against oneself and hatred of one another (3:3). All this contrasts with God’s </p>
<p>compassionate love, God’s way of life (3:4). Paul’s point is: be empathetic as </p>
<p>you deal with those in the world because you used to act like they do now. </p>
<p>But, what happened to former hateful unbelievers such as Paul and </p>
<p>the Cretans? ey did not change their lives by themselves. Rather, two </p>
<p>characteristics of the Savior God appeared in their lives: And when the </p>
<p>kindness and the love for humanity of our Savior God showed itself, not </p>
<p>out of works, the ones in righteousness, which we ourselves prepared, </p>
<p>but according to his mercy, he saved us through washing of rebirth and </p>
<p>renewal by means of the Holy Spirit, who poured out upon us richly </p>
<p>through Jesus Christ our Savior, in order that, having been justied </p>
<p>by that grace, we might become heirs according to hope of eternal life </p>
<p>(3:4–7). In this one sentence, we have a compact summary of the good </p>
<p>news. e main clause is he saved us (3:5), but Paul places before it an </p>
<p>extended adverbial clause, the subject of which is God’s two attributes </p>
<p>(chrēstotēs, philanthrōpia). God’s actions are driven by his attributes, similar </p>
<p>to human foolishness which drives human actions. Chrēstotēs (kindness, </p>
<p>3:4) and its adjective chrēstos are used many times in the Bible to describe </p>
<p>God’s nature.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>In Titus 3:2, 4, Paul has picked up several words used by</p>
<p>Jesus: “I am gentle (praus) and humble in heart, and you will nd rest for </p>
