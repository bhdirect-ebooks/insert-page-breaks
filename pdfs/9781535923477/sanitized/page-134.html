<p>2 Timothy 3120</p>
<p>Paul continues with two attributes that begin with the same preposi-</p>
<p>tion (pro; “before”).</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>To give or hand over in a treacherous manner is to be</p>
<p>a traitor,</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>such as Judas Iscariot, who betrayed even Jesus, God incarnate</p>
<p>(Luke 6:16), and those who betrayed the prophets who foretold the coming </p>
<p>of Jesus, the Righteous One (Acts 7:52). Alexander, the metal worker, ap-</p>
<p>pears to have been such a person betraying Paul (2 Tim 4:14–15). Propetēs, </p>
<p>literally, is “falling forwards” or “down” and thus a precipitous or reckless </p>
<p>act.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Not loving goodness, people will fall down and act recklessly (without</p>
<p>thought). e end result is their brain is clouded with smoke, making their </p>
<p>mind unclear. ey are deluded,</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>loving pleasure (philēdonos) more than</p>
<p>loving God (philotheos; 3:4).</p>
<p>Unlike Romans 1:18–32, where Paul depicts those who do not claim </p>
<p>to be believers, these similar qualities in 2 Timothy 3:2–4 describe actions </p>
<p>of those who claim to live in a godly manner (eusebeia; 3:5). In genuine </p>
<p>godliness one dedicates oneself to please God in one’s words and actions. </p>
<p>One’s life is oered as worship of God.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Morphōsis and its cognates morphē</p>
<p>and morphoō refer to an outward form of godliness seen by the eye that </p>
<p>reects an inward nature or essential attribute.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>For example, when Jesus</p>
<p>was transgured (metamorphoō), his outer glory represented his true in-</p>
<p>ward nature as God.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>In contrast, the external or outward visible form of</p>
<p>godliness of the behavior Paul describes (3:5) is not authentic. Probably, </p>
<p>this description is similar to the ascetic behavior described in 1 Timothy </p>
<p>4:3 and the Jewish heresy described in Titus 1:16. Paul had written about </p>
<p>not denying one’s faith,</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>but denying ungodliness (Titus 2:12), but here,</p>
<p>he writes of denying the power of godliness. What could be the power of </p>
<p>godliness? Most likely, it refers to having the authentic “form” (morphōsis), </p>
<p>where the outward piety reects an inward piety.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Genuine godliness has</p>
<p>power or strength, which is the antithesis of fear (1:7). at power comes </p>
<p>from God who saves and calls according to the purpose and grace mani-</p>
