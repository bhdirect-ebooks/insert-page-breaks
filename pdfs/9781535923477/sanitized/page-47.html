<p>TITUS 2</p>
<p>Teach What Is Consistent with Healthy Doctrine (2:1—3:11)</p>
<p>But you are speaking what is appropriate to healthy teaching (2:1). But </p>
<p>(de) is a strong adversative here. Titus is emphasized.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> He, unlike the op-</p>
<p>ponents (1:9), should be speaking what is appropriate to healthy teaching,</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>described in 2:1—3:8, not the unhealthy teaching described earlier (1:10–</p>
<p>16). Chapter 2 begins the second major section of the letter. e rst major </p>
<p>section is more negative, dealing with setting straight what was remaining </p>
<p>to be done (1:5–16). is next major section is more positive, dealing with </p>
<p>teaching what is consistent with healthy doctrine (2:1—3:11). e rst sub-</p>
<p>section deals with specic groups in the churches, the second subsection </p>
<p>deals with the churches as a whole, and the third subsection deals with Titus </p>
<p>specically. </p>
<p>Godly Behavior among the Elders, Youth, and Slaves (2:1–15) </p>
<p>Paul recommends Titus speak to ve groups: male and female elders, fe-</p>
<p>male and male youth, and slaves: (Encourage) elders (males) to be sober, </p>
<p>honorable, wise, healthy in faith, in love, in perseverance; (encourage) </p>
<p>elders (females), likewise, to be in demeanor holy, not slanderous, and not </p>
<p>enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good, in order that they exhort </p>
<p>the young (females) to be loving their husbands, loving their children, </p>
<p>wise, pure, working at home, good, being subject to their own husbands, </p>
<p>in order that God’s word not be blasphemed (2:2–5).</p>
<p>What is the relationship between the male (presbytēs [2:2]) and female </p>
<p>(presbytis [2:3]) elders to the “elders” of chapter one (presbyteros [1:5<span class="ws61">])? All </span></p>
<p>terms go back to the root presbys (an old person or elder). Presbyteros is </p>
<p>the comparative of presbys,</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>literally, “the older one” or “elder of two,” as in</p>
<p>Luke 15:25. Presbytēs and presbytis are the masculine and feminine prose </p>
<p>forms of presbys. Do the forms in Titus 2 refer to church leadership posi-</p>
<p>1. “You” begins the sentence.</p>
<p>2. See Titus 1:13.</p>
