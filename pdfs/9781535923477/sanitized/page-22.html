<p>Titus 18</p>
<p>Sōtēr is a frequent and an interesting word in Titus.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Whenever God</p>
<p>is referred to as our Savior, a second reference soon follows to Christ Jesus </p>
<p>as “our Savior” (1:3–4; 2:10–13; 3:4–6). us, Paul emphasizes by juxtapo-</p>
<p>sition that both persons of the Trinity are “our Savior.” Moreover, in one </p>
<p>passage Jesus Christ is even called “God” (2:13). e “Savior” commands, </p>
<p>gives grace and peace (1:3–4), teaches (2:10), has glory (2:13), is kind, lov-</p>
<p>ing, and pours out salvation (3:4, 6). “Savior” is also an important politi-</p>
<p>cal word during this era. Caesar was acclaimed as “savior” of the people. </p>
<p>From AD 66–68 Nero was ocially described as “lord and saviour of the </p>
<p>w or ld .”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> Although the emperor could command and have temporal glory,</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p>in contrast to the eternal God, Nero certainly did not exhibit grace, peace, </p>
<p>kindness, love, and salvation.</p>
<p>Titus, like Timothy, is described as a genuine child (1:4; 1 Tim 1:2). </p>
<p>Possibly Jews at Crete might “criticize” Titus (2:15) because he was an un-</p>
<p>circumcised Greek (Gal 2:3). Unlike Timothy, whose mother was Jewish </p>
<p>but father was Gentile, Titus was not compelled by the leaders in Jerusalem </p>
<p>to be circumcised (Acts 16:1–3). us, Paul uses genuine or “legitimate” </p>
<p>as a word play. As a Gentile, Titus’ faith, held in common with Jews, made </p>
<p>him a “legitimate or genuine” child. Titus also demonstrated a “genuine” </p>
<p>faith. Titus rst appears from Antioch in Syria accompanying Paul with </p>
<p>a relief visit to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> Titus is gied in organization. He helped ar-</p>
<p>range the relief collection for the poor in Judea (2 Cor 2:13; 7:7; 8:17). As </p>
<p>Paul’s coworker and partner, he is “urged,” but not “sent,” to go to Corinth </p>
<p>as Paul’s representative (2 Cor 8:6, 17, 23; 12:18). At Corinth he functions </p>
<p>as a peacemaker, also representing the Corinthians to Paul (2 Cor 7:7, 15). </p>
<p>At Crete, Titus will again use his organizational and peacemaking gis with </p>
<p>the church to put in order what remained to be done (e.g., Titus 1:5).</p>
<p>6. Six of twenty-four NT instances, which comprise 25 percent of the NT references, </p>
<p>although Titus is about 0.5 percent of the NT. In fact, ten or 41.6 percent of all NT refer-</p>
<p>ences of sōtēr occur in the Pastoral Letters.</p>
<p>7. Hanson 1982: 186.</p>
<p>8. Once when Nero entered Rome, for example, he came in Augustus’s chariot wear-</p>
<p>ing a purple robe and a Greek cloak adorned with golden stars with the Olympic crown </p>
on his head (Suetonius, 6. Nero 25.1). Gaius Caligula and Nero took their divine status
<p>seriously (Alan Richardson, “Salvation, Savior,” IDB 4:177).</p>
<p>9. Gal 2:1–3, which probably refers to the mission described in Acts 11:29–30, but </p>
<p>could refer to the one mentioned in Acts 15:2–4.</p>
