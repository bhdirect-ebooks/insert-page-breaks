<p>TITUS 1</p>
<p>Address (1:1–4)</p>
<p>All the components of the letter are present in microcosm in the intro-</p>
<p>duction. In the letterhead, Paul has an introduction second in length only </p>
<p>to that of Romans (46 vs. 71 Greek words). His self-description contains </p>
<p>themes he will develop in the letter, such as “knowledge of the truth” and </p>
<p>God and Jesus as “our Savior.” Like most ancient letters, the rst sentence </p>
<p>presents the author, the reader, and the greeting (Paul, God’s slave, and </p>
<p>Jesus Christ’s apostle, Titus, grace and peace). Paul adds, though, two </p>
<p>lengthy prepositional phrases to describe his apostleship: (1) according </p>
<p>to faith of God’s elect ones and knowledge of truth, the one according </p>
<p>to godliness; and (2) upon hope of eternal life, which the truthful God </p>
<p>promised before eternal time and revealed, in [God’s] own time, his </p>
<p>word in proclamation, which I myself was entrusted according to the </p>
<p>command of God our Savior (1:1–3). is is a dense synopsis of the Chris-</p>
<p>tian message. Paul reminds Titus rst of the importance of one’s calling </p>
<p>resting upon faith, that God elects, that God’s revelation is true, and it af-</p>
<p>fects one’s way of life (eusebeia). Paul then reminds Titus of the second basis </p>
<p>of his apostleship: hope of eternal life. God, who is described as “truthful” </p>
<p>did two actions in regard to “eternal life”: promised and revealed. Both </p>
<p>relate to time: eternal life was promised before eternal time, eternal life was </p>
<p>revealed in God’s own time by means of proclamation. Paul then reiterates </p>
<p>that he was entrusted with this proclamation by command of God.</p>
<p>Paul normally describes himself as a “slave of Christ” (e.g., Rom 1:1; </p>
<p>Phil 1:1; Gal 1:10). Here in contrast he calls himself a slave of God. Possibly, </p>
<p>his reason is that in this letter he will clarify that Jesus Christ is indeed </p>
<p>“God.” Later in the letter, as a “slave of God,” he will also give directions to </p>
<p>slaves of human masters (2:9–10). </p>
<p>e content of faith and its demonstration in one’s lifestyle are impor-</p>
<p>tant themes for this letter. Titus is a genuine child according to the faith </p>
<p>held in common (1:4). A “healthy or sound” faith is important to have in </p>
<p>contrast to those who have an unhealthy or unsound faith (1:14). Slaves </p>
