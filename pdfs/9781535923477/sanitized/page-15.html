<p>Introduction to Pastoral Letters</p>
<p>When Luke the evangelist wrote his Gospel, he highlighted for eophi-</p>
<p>lus, his reader, some of the features he oered, while arming the Gospels </p>
<p>already written (Luke 1:1–4). Following the model of this wonderful histo-</p>
<p>rian, I, too, would like to arm the many wonderful commentaries written </p>
<p>on the Pastoral Epistles, which are Pastor Paul’s instructions and admoni-</p>
<p>tions to two young pastors. Like the other commentary writers of the New </p>
<p>Covenant Commentary Series, I come from an international background, </p>
<p>born and reared in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and later in New </p>
<p>Jersey in the United States, my mother from Puerto Rico and my father </p>
<p>from e Netherlands. Like others in the series, I have focused on the ow </p>
<p>of argument. My own translation is an attempt to illustrate the literal text as </p>
<p>a basis for interpretation and stylistic analysis. I have studied the meaning </p>
<p>of the text in light of its immediate and larger literary, biblical, historical, </p>
<p>social, and cultural contexts. In particular, I have asked myself, how might </p>
<p>these ancient communities have understood and received these teachings? </p>
<p>To enrich my study, I traveled to Crete, Ephesus, Rome, and Greece, visiting </p>
<p>many key ancient Greco-Roman sites. ese were wonderful trips, which </p>
<p>were accomplished with the help and companionship of my husband and </p>
<p>son, Rev. Dr. William David Spencer and Mr. Stephen William Spencer.</p>
<p>In addition, I have always thought that scholarship would be advanced </p>
<p>if more women were to study and publish on these letters that relate fre-</p>
<p>quently to women and to church life. us, as a female Presbyterian min-</p>
<p>ister ordained for over forty years (October 1973), I have paid consistent </p>
<p>attention to any issues that relate to women and their role in the church. It </p>
<p>is not, however, a commentary solely focused on “women’s issues.” As an </p>
<p>active minister, who has taught New Testament theology for ministry for </p>
<p>many years, I have also highlighted Paul’s ministry strategies, his cowork-</p>
<p>ers, and their community. My own initial training was in stylistics, and, </p>
<p>thus, when appropriate, I have also highlighted Paul’s rhetorical strategies.</p>
<p>Even though I have focused on the ow of argument, paragraphs and </p>
<p>sentences are constructed from words and phrases. erefore, in order to </p>
<p>study the thoughts, I have also paid attention to semantics and grammar. </p>
