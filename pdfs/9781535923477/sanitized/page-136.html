<p>ey</p>
<p>are not motivated by love of God (3:4), but by love of themselves, money, </p>
<p>or pleasure (3:2, 4). Who does the imprisoning? ey are described by the </p>
<p>generic anthrōpos (people; 3:2) or the generic masculine plural (these, tou-</p>
<p>tous; the ones, hoi; <span class="_ _1" />3:5–6<span class="ws56">). <span class="_ _1" />us, the false teachers pro<span class="_ _1" />bably incl<span class="_ _1" />ude wom<span class="_ _1" />en </span></p>
<p>as well as men.</p>

<p>Some younger widows would be likely dispersers of these</p>
<p>falsehoods (1 Tim 5:13, 15). In conservative wealthy homes, the women </p>
<p>might live in gynaikeia, the part of the house belonging to women, and only </p>
<p>women could enter that section.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> Some women in particular are the victims.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Paul uses the diminutive</p>
<p>for women (gynaikarion; 3:6).</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>Most commentators think “little women”</p>
<p>is a derogatory term,</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> but it is not necessarily.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> e rst-century (AD 50–</p>
<p>120) Stoic philosopher Epictetus used gynaikarion as a positive term for an </p>
<p>attractive woman. Wars arise to win her, he writes (Diatr. 2.22 [23]). Men </p>
<p>wish to please her (3:1[32]). Attractive women capture the “citadel (acropo-</p>
<p>lis)” of fever within men (4.1[86]).</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>It is also a term of endearment for “a</p>
<p>little wife and child” (Ench. 7). ese women are described in three ways: </p>
<p>(1) overwhelmed with sins, (2) being led by manifold passions, and (3) </p>
<p>always learning and never being able to come into knowledge of truth </p>
<p>(3:6–7). Overwhelmed (sōreuō) is a metaphor, literally signifying “to heap </p>
<p>together” or “to heap up.”</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>In Romans 12:20, Paul refers to Proverb 25:22,</p>
<p>heaping up burning coals on an enemy’s head. Hospitality for one’s enemies </p>
<p>results in a judgment against them, but a reward from God, whereas, in 2 </p>

<p>35. Obviously not Prisca (4:19). Irenaeus cites the example of the magician Marcus </p>
<p>who emphasized deceiving and seducing wealthy women by attery (Haer. 1.13.3).</p>
<p>36. LSJ, 363; BDAG, 208; Robertson 1931: 624. e diminutive is used by Marcus </p>
<p>Aurelius Antoninus 5.11.</p>
<p>37. BDAG, 208; Robertson 1934: 155; Fee 1988: 272; “silly women” (NTME, REB, </p>
<p>KJV, NRSV, NIRV, YLT); “weak women” (TEV, NASB, ESV); “weak-willed women” (NIV </p>
<p>1984); “weak-minded women” (GW); “gullible women” (TNIV, NIV 2011); “immature </p>
<p>women” (CEB); “foolish women” (NLT).</p>
<p>38. MM (133): “society ladies borne by caprices in various directions and full of idle </p>
<p>curiosity”; “little women” (WYC); Bassler (1996: 160): “the term is not as pejorative as </p>
<p>the NRSV translation”; “vulnerable women” (NLT); in Spanish, “mujercillas” (RV, BA).</p>
<p>39. See also Epictetus, Diatr. 2.18 (18); 3.22 (36–37). Witherington III (2006: 353) </p>
