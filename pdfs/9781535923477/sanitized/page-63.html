<p>Teach What Is Consistent with Healthy Doctrine (2:1—3:11)</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>not stealing, but showing oneself trustworthy, the Christian slave “makes </p>
<p>attractive” or honors the teachings of God, encouraging salvation for the </p>
<p>slave, the master, and for others.</p>
<p>All the principles for the slaves, as well as all the other groups, are for </p>
<p>the nal purpose of encouraging salvation for all humans: For God’s grace </p>
<p>illuminated with saving power all humans, instructing us, in order that, </p>
<p>having denied for ourselves the ungodliness and the alluring passions, </p>
<p>wisely and uprightly and in a godly manner we might live in the now </p>
<p>age, waiting for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great </p>
<p>God and our Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself in behalf of us, in or-</p>
<p>der that he might ransom us from every lawlessness and he might purify </p>
<p>for himself a chosen people, an enthusiast of good works (2:11–14). Paul </p>
<p>wants Titus to “set straight what was remaining” at the church in Crete, </p>
<p>rst, by appointing godly elders and rebuking ungodly people (1:5–16) and, </p>
<p>second, by teaching what is consistent with healthy doctrine (2:1—3:11). </p>
<p>Paul wants Titus to promote healthy teaching by encouraging godly be-</p>
<p>havior among the elders, youth, and slaves (2:1–15) so God’s word is not </p>
<p>slandered. And now Paul digs down to the positive foundational principle: </p>
<p>God’s grace illuminated with saving power all humans.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>As the sun and</p>
<p>the stars illuminate (epiphainō) the darkness (Acts 27:20), so too God’s </p>
<p>grace illuminates those living in spiritual darkness because of their sins </p>
<p>(Luke 1:76–79). Paul (like John the Baptist [Luke 3:3–6]) may be allud-</p>
<p>ing to Isaiah 40:1–6 in Titus 2:11–13. ese passages include reference to </p>
<p>the forgiveness of sins (Isa 40:1–2; Luke 3:3; Titus 2:14), making “straight” </p>
<p>(Isa 40:3–4; Titus 2:12; 1:5; Luke 3:4), the salvic nature of God’s work (Isa </p>
<p>40:5; Luke 3:6; Titus 2:11), and the appearance of God’s glory (Isa 40:5–10; </p>
<p>Titus 2:13) to all humans (Isa 40:5; Luke 3:6; Titus 2:11). Humans have seen </p>
<p>the appearance of God’s grace in order that they be instructed. Paideuō </p>
<p>(2:12) has to do with the daily instruction and supervision of conduct of a </p>
<p>minor.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>e Cretans too were “minors” in the faith and needed to become</p>
<p>more mature. Grace is the name of their pedagogue or tutor or governess. </p>
<p>e limitations (or “laws”) in Titus are not ends in themselves but means </p>
<p>to a better life. </p>
<p>ey should live in ve ways: having denied, wisely, uprightly, in </p>
<p>a godly manner, waiting (2:12–13). Negative behavior needs to end be-</p>
<p>fore positive behavior begins (e.g., Eph 4:22–24; Col 3:5–17). Oen deny </p>
<p>63. “Saving power” is a helpful translation by Towner 2006: 745.</p>
