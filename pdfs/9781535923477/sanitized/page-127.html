<p>Avoid Ungodly Talking, BecomeaVesselforGoodWorks(2:14–26)</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>Paul now warns Timothy to continue to beware of specic tempta-</p>
<p>tions: But keep on eeing the youthful passions and keep on pursuing </p>
<p>righteousness, faith, love, peace, accompanied by the act of calling upon </p>
<p>the Lord from a clean heart (2:22). Passions (epithymia) or “desires” are </p>
<p>strong feelings turned upon something.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>ey can be good or harmful.</p>
<p>ey can refer to coveting what belongs to another,</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>such as wealth, but</p>
<p>since in this verse they are modied by youthful, and Timothy himself was </p>
<p>probably in his late twenties or early thirties,</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>what belongs to another is</p>
<p>probably sexual.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>Similar language is used in 1 essalonians 4 to exhort</p>
<p>Christians to control their “vessel.”</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>e same verb ee (pheugō) is used in</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 6:18 (“ee sexual immorality”).</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>In the same way as sheep</p>
<p>will ee from strangers (John 10:5), Timothy should ee from youthful pas-</p>
<p>sions. But, he should not leave a vacuum in his being. e same active in-</p>
<p>tensity should be directed to keep on pursuing righteousness, faith, love, </p>
<p>peace (2:22). e rst three of these attributes were mentioned in Paul’s </p>
<p>personal exhortation to Timothy in 1 Timothy, attributes Timothy was to </p>
<p>keep pursuing.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p> Faith and love are two key concerns at Ephesus.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>Later,</p>
<p>Paul will explain that Scripture helps in training in righteousness and faith </p>
<p>(3:15–16).</p>
<p>111</p>
<p> Peace was included in the opening greetings,</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>but here is</p>
<p>reiterated because, if Timothy pursues peace, he will be able to be gentle </p>
<p>with his opponents (2:24–25).</p>
<p>Timothy is to keep pursuing these four virtues while calling upon the </p>
<p>Lord from a clean heart (2:22b). In this letter consistently, human action </p>
<p>and God’s action occur concurrently. While Timothy ees from harmful </p>
<p>103. See 1 Tim 6:9 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>104. Exod 20:17; Deut 5:21.</p>
<p>105. See 1 Tim 4:12 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>106. Passions can also be interpreted in a more general way to refer to any general </p>
<p>desires characteristic of youth contrary to righteousness, faith, love, peace, especially </p>
<p>those which would lessen patience toward opponents, such as impulses to impatience, </p>
<p>love of disputation, self-assertion, self-indulgence, headstrong passions (Lock 1924: 101; </p>
<p>Towner 2006: 544; Fee 1988: 262 vs. 274). See also 3:6.</p>
<p>107. Epithymia, hagiasmos, timē, skeuos (1 ess 4:4–7).</p>
<p>108. Sexual immorality, like disunity and heresy, aects the whole body of believers as </p>
<p>God’s sanctuary (1 Cor 3:16–17; 6:18–19; 2 Cor 6:14–17; Spencer 2001: 114–15).</p>
<p>109. See 1 Tim 6:11 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>110. 1 Tim 1:5, 14; 2 Tim 1:13.</p>
<p>111. See 1 Tim 1:5, 14, 19 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>112. 1 Tim 1:2; 2 Tim 1:2; Titus 1:4.</p>
