<p>Titus 112</p>
<p>look upon or over.”</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>In Acts 20:28, “to oversee” includes the function of</p>
<p>overseeing doctrine and is synonymous with shepherding (also 1 Pet 5:2).</p>
<p>As in Acts (14:23; 20:17), every church in each city should have more </p>
<p>than one elder (1:5). In Crete, historically, the cities were notorious for </p>
<p>their disputes with one another. Willetts summarizes their relationship as </p>
<p>“almost perpetual warfare.”</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>e two most powerful city states, Knossos in</p>
<p>the north and Gortyn in the south, were repeatedly in conict.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>But, nally,</p>
<p>in 67 BC, Crete became a Roman province and Gortyn its capital.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>us,</p>
<p>Paul, by directing Titus to set up elders in every city, was beginning where </p>
<p>the people were, blending the Christian organization with the indigenous </p>
<p>one. </p>
<p>Paul does not clarify how Titus was to go about the process of setting </p>
<p>up elders, except to make specic their moral qualities. However, Moses </p>
<p>certainly had encouraged the Hebrew tribes to select their own leaders </p>
<p>(Deut 1:13), and Paul appears to allow the local Christians to select their </p>
<p>elders.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>What Paul did not require is instructive. Paul did not require that</p>
<p>the elders be Jewish, or circumcised, as the circumcision party might have </p>
<p>required. Paul did not require that the elders be aristocrats, as the Minoans </p>
<p>might have required.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Paul did not require that the elders be free citizens,</p>
<p>as the Romans or Greeks required.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>Paul did not require that the elders be</p>
<p>wealthy, men of leisure, as the rabbis required (m. Meg. 1:3; 4:3). ere is no </p>
<p>mention of ethnic or class or political or economic status. e term elder </p>
<p>probably implied a certain age. Some early rabbis said thirty was the age for </p>
<p>21. ayer, 242. Robertson (Word Pictures, 1930: 3:217) suggests “<span class="_ _3" />elder” was the Jew<span class="ws1">-</span></p>
<p>ish name and “overseer” the Greek name for the same oce.</p>
<p>22. Willetts 1965: 152.</p>
<p>23. “Aer Cnossus, the city of the Gortynians seems to have ranked second in power; </p>
<p>for when these two co-operated they held in subjection all the rest of the inhabitants, </p>
<p>and when they had a quarrel there was dissension throughout the island” (Strabo, Geogr. </p>
<p>10.4 [478]). </p>
<p>24. Willetts 1965: 152–57.</p>
<p>25. ayer, 668; LSJ, 1986. Acts 14:23, cheirotoneō, literally means “<span class="_ _1" />to v<span class="_ _1" />ote by s<span class="_ _1" />tretch<span class="ws1">-</span></p>
<p>ing out the hand.” According to John Calvin, Paul and Barnabas “suer the matter to </p>
<p>be decided by the consent of them all. erefore, in ordaining pastors the people had </p>
<p>their free election, but lest there should any tumult arise, Paul and Barnabas sit as chief </p>
<p>moderators” (Calvin’s Commentaries John-Acts: 1168).</p>
<p>26. Among the Minoans in Crete, only the aristocrats (not the serfs) could carry arms </p>
<p>and exercise in the gym. At “manhood,” aer years of training, Cretan youths wore the </p>
<p>mature citizen warrior’s dress (Willetts 1965: 87, 95–96, 117).</p>
<p>27. e political leadership in Greece was done by adult free male citizens (Willetts </p>
<p>1965: 149).</p>
