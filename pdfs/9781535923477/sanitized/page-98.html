<p>tears, remembered (hypomnēsis) Timothy’s faith, and now he calls to re-</p>
<p>membrance or reminds (anamimnēskō)</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Timothy to act on this “genuine</p>
<p>faith” that he has. If in 1 Timothy 4:14, Paul exhorts Timothy not to neglect </p>
<p>his spiritual gi, now he tells him to keep lighting it up again, stirring into </p>
<p>ame or causing to blaze again</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>God’s gi (1:6) of evangelism (2 Tim 4:5).</p>
<p>Anazōpyreō is a concrete image. Zōpyron is an ember of a re or a hot coal</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> </p>
<p>that is used to kindle a re. Paul repeats the preposition ana- (anamimnēsko </p>
<p>. . . anazōpyreō; 1:6). Ana- implies repetition or “motion upwards.”</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>As</p>
<p>long as a re has hot coals, it can be easily stirred up into a blaze of re. </p>
<p>Spiritual gis from God can become dormant.</p>
<p>Why would evangelism be such a dicult gi to heighten at this </p>
<p>time? Timothy only has to see Paul’s situation to become cautious before </p>
<p>he reaches out aggressively with the good news into his society. Paul is in </p>
<p>prison again and this time the circumstances are less hopeful for release </p>
<p>(1:8; 4:7, 16). No wonder Paul explains: for God did not give to you a </p>
<p>spirit of fear but of power and of love and self-control (1:7). In English, </p>
<p>“Timothy” and “timid” form a quotable word-play, but not in Greek (Timo-</p>
<p>theos vs. deilia). Timothy might become fearful not because of his own </p>
<p>personal nature, but more because of the dangerous situation in which the </p>
<p>Christians nd themselves, suering persecution for their faith (1:8). For a </p>
<p>good reason, Timothy might be fearful since he himself will eventually be </p>
<p>imprisoned in Rome as well (Heb 13:23). If Timothy indeed was a former </p>
<p>soldier,</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>he might very well appreciate the rst two adjectives: fear and</p>
<p>power (1:7). Fear describes the disciples when their boat was swamped by </p>
<p>waves from a erce storm (Matt 8:24–26). Spicq explains: Paul “stirs up ‘the </p>
<p>good soldier of Jesus Christ’ (2 Tim 2:3) to undertake and pursue combat </p>
<p>(1 Tim 1:18), according to the traditional military maxim, dating back to </p>
<p>Deuteronomy: ‘Conquer…fear not and be not disheartened.’”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>31</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Power (dynamis) or “strength” is the antithesis of fear (1:7). Courage </p>
<p>takes strength. e best strength comes from God (1:8). A soldier must </p>
