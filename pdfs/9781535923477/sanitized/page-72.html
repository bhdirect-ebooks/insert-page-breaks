<p>Titus 358</p>
<p>“so” voice or a reasonable, fair, mild, not angry or contentious, manner.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In the Old and New Testaments, we learn that the “meek shall inherit the </p>
<p>earth” (Ps 36:11; Matt 5:5). In Psalm 36, the “meek” are those who may be </p>
<p>envious of the worldly success of sinners and even may be unjustly treated </p>
<p>by evil-doers, but, if the “meek” persist in doing the good that God re-</p>
<p>quires, they will be rewarded by God and will live in peace. Moses was </p>
<p>known as more “meek” than all the people living on the earth during his </p>
<p>lifetime (Num 12:3). us, when Paul calls the church at Crete to exhibit </p>
<p>humility, he is exhorting them to be gentle, humble, noncontentious, good, </p>
<p>and to rely on the Lord’s care. </p>
<p>How might the Cretans react to such commands? Cretans were </p>
<p>known for their military upbringing. During the Hellenistic period, “Cre-</p>
<p>tan mercenaries became as familiar as Cretan pirates.”</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>e cities in Crete</p>
<p>were in “almost perpetual warfare.”</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Polybius remarked that the Cretans</p>
<p>“are involved in constant broils both public and private, and in murders </p>
<p>and civil wars” (Polybius, Hist. 6.46.9). ey might well understand the ne-</p>
<p>cessity to obey their military superiors (Titus 3:1). However, the emphasis </p>
<p>on gentleness and peacemaking (3:2) would be more dicult to act on. </p>
<p>Would the aristocracy be able to be gentle with the peasantry and slaves? </p>
<p>Now the Christian Cretans would have to redirect their values to those of </p>
<p>peacemaking.</p>
<p>Paul explains his rationale for cooperating with ruling authorities in </p>
<p>Titus 3:3–7: For we once also ourselves were foolish, disobedient, being </p>
<p>led astray, enslaved to passions and manifold pleasures, living in wick-</p>
<p>edness and envy, hated, hating one another (3:3).</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Anoētos (foolish) has</p>
<p>the basic idea of slow to understand, as humans who are thinking like cattle </p>
<p>to which human words are unintelligible (Ps 48: 12, 20; 4 Macc 5:8–9). is </p>
<p>state can come from lack of education (Rom 1:14) or from being deceived </p>
<p>or lack of belief (Gal 3:1; Luke 24:25). e New Testament speaks of those </p>
<p>who obey (or are persuaded by) the good news (the word) as opposed to </p>
<p>those who disobey (or are not persuaded).</p>

<p>15. Paul uses asyndeton (the omission of conjunctions between a series of two or </p>
<p>more words, phrases, or clauses) to list a series of negative qualities, emphasizing we by </p>
<p>including the pronoun (Spencer 1998b: 188).</p>
<p>16. Disobedient (apeithēs) literally is “not persuadable” (1 Pet 2:8; 3:20; 4:17).</p>
