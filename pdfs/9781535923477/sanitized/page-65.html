<p>Teach What Is Consistent with Healthy Doctrine (2:1—3:11)</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>While Christians refuse to keep behaving as non-Christians and in-</p>
<p>stead live in ways pleasing to God, they wait expectantly. Such faithful liv-</p>
<p>ing should aect their perspective toward the past and the present and the </p>
<p>future (2:12–13). Prosdechomai can signify “looking forward” to an event, </p>
<p>such as God’s kingdom (Mark 15:43), or the resurrection (Acts 24:15), or </p>
<p>to a person, so as to “welcome” them (Luke 12:36).</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>Jesus would eat with</p>
<p>sinners to “welcome” them into the kingdom (Luke 15:2). Paul wanted his </p>
<p>readers to welcome Phoebe and Epaphroditus (Rom 16:2; Phil 2:29). In </p>
<p>the same way as devoted slaves would look forward to serve their master, </p>
<p>Christians should look forward to serve their Master, Jesus Christ. e way </p>
<p>to wait for Christ is to avoid behavior that displeases Jesus and proactively </p>
<p>live in ways pleasing to Christ (Titus 2:12). In this way, the now age aects </p>
<p>the age to come (2:12–13). </p>
<p>God’s grace illuminated humans with saving power because of the </p>
<p>incarnation and return of Jesus Christ. Only God can save humans eter-</p>
<p>nally. at is why humans should be living in a way to welcome Jesus’ sec-</p>
<p>ond appearing (Acts 1:11). We have seen</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>how both God (1:3; 2:10; 3:4)</p>
<p>and Jesus Christ (1:4; 2:13; 3:6) are called savior. In 2:13, Jesus is called </p>
<p>God and Savior.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>By a Gentile, such a title might be possible, but a devout</p>
<p>monotheistic Jew as Paul would have undergone a great transformation to </p>
<p>arm one God in three Persons. As the Jewish philosopher Philo explains: </p>
<p>the “most grievous” of all sins for Jews is “when the created and corruptible </p>
<p>nature” of humanity was made to appear “uncreated and incorruptible…</p>
<p>since sooner could God change into a human than a human into God” </p>
<p>(Embassy 16 [118]).</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jesus is our Savior because he gave himself in behalf of us (2:14). </p>
<p>Titus 2:14 alludes to Jesus’ words about himself to his disciples: “e Son </p>
<p>of Humanity did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life </p>
<p>70. Examples are Joseph of Arimathea, Simeon, and Anna, who looked forward to </p>
<p>God’s work in the world (Mark 15:43; Luke 2:25, 38; 23:51).</p>
<p>71. See Titus 1:3–4.</p>
<p>72. According to Granville Sharp’s grammar rule, when “the copulative kai connects </p>
<p>two nouns of the same case, if the article precedes the rst noun and is not repeated </p>
<p>before the second noun, the latter always refers to the same person that is expressed or </p>
<p>described by the rst noun” (Metzger 1953: 79). A similar phrase occurs in 2 Pet 1:1. </p>
<p>Jesus is also explicitly named as God in Matt 1:23; Mark 2:7; Luke 9:42–43; John 1:1, </p>
<p>18; 5:17–18; 8:56–59; 10:30; 20:28; Rom 9:5; Phil 2:5–6; Col 2:8–9; 2 ess 1:12; 1 Tim </p>
<p>3:15–16; Heb 1:8; 1 John 5:20. See also Harris 1992.</p>
<p>73. See 1 Tim 3:16.</p>
