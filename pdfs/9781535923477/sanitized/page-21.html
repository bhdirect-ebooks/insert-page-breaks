<p>need to demonstrate their “good” faith in their actions (2:10) and love is </p>
<p>done in the sphere of faith (3:15). </p>
<p>Truth (1:1, 2) (or its opposite) is not a frequent word-family in Titus </p>
<p>but it is important since it sets an overarching theme. God does not lie </p>
<p>(1:2). erefore, God’s message is truth (1:1). Paul’s testimony is also true </p>
<p>(1:13). Heterodoxy leads people away from the truth (1:14).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Eusebeia (godliness; 1:1) literally refers to “good reverence or wor-</p>
<p>ship.” It is an important word-family in the Pastoral Letters,</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>where “godly</p>
<p>living” is an important topic. Orthodoxy aects orthopraxy. One way to live </p>
<p>is in a “godly manner” (2:12).</p>
<p>e object of hope is eternal life, both in 1:2 and 3:7. us, eternal life </p>
<p>is something to which we aspire. at is why the “now age” (2:12) aects </p>
<p>the eternal age. In 2:13, hope more specically refers to the reappearance </p>
<p>of Jesus Christ. Eternal life is a term frequently used in the Gospels.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Aiōn</p>
<p>may be connected to aēmi (“to breathe, blow, as to denote properly that </p>
<p>which causes life, vital force”).</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>us, “eternal life” may be considered to be</p>
<p>“a life that is alive.” Understanding that “life” is a central aspect of “eternal” </p>
<p>helps us understand the “now,” but “not yet” aspect of “eternal life” (1:2). </p>
<p>In Titus and for Paul and for the lawyer and ruler who asked Jesus, “What </p>
<p>must I do to inherit eternal life?” (Luke 10:25; 18:18), eternal life is some-</p>
<p>thing to obtain and to which one aspires (e.g., 1 Tim 6:12). Jesus and his </p>
<p>disciple John bring out that it is also something one now has. Eternal life, </p>
<p>according to Jesus’ prayer, is to know the only true God and Jesus Christ </p>
<p>whom he sent (John 17:3). e goal or end is eternal life, but also it is a free </p>
<p>gi from God in Christ Jesus. In eect, when one decides to keep or lose </p>
<p>one’s life, one begins a trajectory in either the direction of eternal life or </p>
<p>eternal punishment.</p>

<p>In this introduction, we nd clear examples of the archetypal uses of </p>
<p>chronos and kairos. Chronos has to do with duration: God’s eternal time </p>
<p>(1:2). In contrast, kairos has to do with changeableness: human specic </p>
<p>time (1:3).</p>
<p>1. For a letter that claims to be about truth, ironically some contemporary scholars </p>
<p>claim that it was written neither by Paul nor to Titus nor were either of them in Crete: </p>
<p>“e Pastoral Epistles practiced their deception with great success and inuence for </p>
<p>nearly two thousand years” (Marshall 2008: 799). </p>
<p>2. irteen of twenty-two NT occurrences, 59 percent. See also 1 Tim 4:8.</p>
<p>3. Twenty-ve times vs. nine times by Paul, eight times elsewhere in the NT.</p>
<p>4. ayer, 18, 20.</p>
<p>5. John 12:25; Matt 25:46; Rom 6:22–23; 2 Cor 2:15.</p>
