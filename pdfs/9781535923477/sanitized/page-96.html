<p>2 Timothy 182</p>
<p>the spiritual parent, Paul, was reciprocated by the child, Timothy (1:4). </p>
<p>Paul in his prayers remembered Timothy’s tears. Dakryō/dakryon refer “to </p>
<p>shed tears, weep silently.”</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Tears may express outwardly inward concerns.</p>
<p>Timothy is concerned for Paul. Did Timothy cry when Paul was arrested in </p>
<p>Rome again?</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Timothy was like his mentor Paul, who had told the elders</p>
<p>from Ephesus how he had served the Lord “with all humility and tears,” </p>
<p>and, as a father, he exhorted them with tears (Acts 20:19, 31). Tears were </p>
<p>an aspect of Paul’s love for the Corinthians (2 Cor 2:4). Both Timothy and </p>
<p>Paul modeled on Jesus himself, God incarnate, who prayed with both silent </p>
<p>tears and loud shouts (Heb 5:7) and wept upon seeing the grief expressed </p>
<p>by humans mourning the death of Lazarus, even though he knew he would </p>
<p>resurrect him from the dead (John 11:25–26, 32–44). God’s compassion </p>
<p>may be demonstrated in tears, but these types of tears from this suering </p>
<p>world will all be wiped away by God when God dwells with humans in the </p>
<p>new earth (Rev 7:17; 21:4). Somehow the end of the prayers and longing </p>
<p>to see Timothy, remembering his tears, will result in Paul being lled with </p>
<p>joy, if he indeed sees Timothy. And, indeed, he will ask Timothy to come </p>
<p>soon (2 Tim 4:9, 21).</p>
<p>Paul remembers Timothy’s tears and Timothy’s genuine faith (1:5). </p>
<p>To remember is an important act in the Bible (e.g., 1 Cor 11:2) and here </p>
<p>particularly as Paul faces his own death. Later, he will ask Timothy to cause </p>
<p>other believers to remember (“remind”; 2:14).</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Peter, too, in his last letter,</p>
<p>focuses on reminding his readers.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Paul’s joy is not only to see Timothy, but</p>
<p>to see Timothy in light of his genuine faith. His faith is without hypocrisy.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Faith is described metaphorically as a friend who dwells within </p>
<p>(enoikeō) someone, even as the Holy Spirit dwells within the church.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>the three daily oerings in the temple in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>to grief ”), thrēneō (“to give formal expression to grief”), alalazō (“to wail in oriental </p>
<p>style”) or stenazō (“to express grief by inarticulate or semi-articulate sounds, to groan”) </p>
