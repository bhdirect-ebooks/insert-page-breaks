<p>Introduction to 2 Timothy</p>
<p>Introduction </p>
<p>Occasion</p>
<p>Unlike Titus and 1 Timothy, in 2 Timothy,</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Paul is now in prison. Paul is the</p>
<p>Lord’s “prisoner” who is “suering for the gospel” (1:8, 12). Paul mentions </p>
<p>his own suering many times (he suers hardship for the gospel, “even to </p>
<p>the point of being chained like a criminal,” while, in contrast, “the word of </p>
<p>God is not chained” [2:9] and he quotes a “saying” that encourages Chris-</p>
<p>tians who suer [2:11]). Paul summarizes his life (3:10–11; 4:7–8) and the </p>
<p>inevitability of persecution for a Christian (3:12). He discusses “death,” </p>
<p>which has been “abolished” by Christ Jesus (1:10). Unlike the situation in </p>
<p>the other prison epistles (Phil 1:14; Col 4:7–14), all in Asia “have turned </p>
<p>away” from or le Paul, including Phygelus and Hermogenes (1:15), Demas </p>
<p>(4:10), Crescens, Titus (4:10), and Alexander (4:14). At his rst defense, </p>
<p>all “deserted” him (4:16). In contrast, Onesiphorus’ household was “not </p>
<p>ashamed” of Paul’s “chain.” Instead, when Onesiphorus’ household arrived </p>
<p>in Rome from Ephesus, he eagerly searched for Paul and found him (1:16–</p>
<p>18). In this context, Paul’s main message to Timothy is not to be ashamed of </p>
<p>his imprisonment, but rather to “share in suering” (2:3; 4:5).</p>
<p>Similar problems continue to occur at Ephesus as had been occurring </p>
<p>earlier in Ephesus and Crete: “wrangling over words” (2:14), “stupid and </p>
<p>senseless controversies” (2:23), women who do not know the “knowledge </p>
<p>of the truth” (3:7), false teachers (3:7; 4:3), and myths (4:4).</p>
<p>Instead of expecting release (Phlm 2:2; Phil 2:24; 1:25–26), Paul de-</p>
<p>scribes impending death (4:6; cf. Phil 2:17). At his rst defense, he was </p>
<p>rescued from “the lion’s mouth” (4:17). Yet he still expects to write (4:13), </p>
<p>and he expects to see Timothy before winter impedes transportation (4:21). </p>
<p>According to tradition, to avoid arrest, Paul had rented a villa or room </p>
<p>1. See Spencer 2013, Introduction to Pastoral Letters. Authorship of Pastoral Letters.</p>
