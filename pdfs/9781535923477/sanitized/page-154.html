<p>is the very essence of athletics and the real prize is the honor of victory.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul has exerted eort as a believer and he looked forward to his prize, </p>
<p>the “righteous crown” (4:8). A ght (or athletics) is a general term, a race </p>
<p>course now indicates a specic type of sport. Paul had previously described </p>
<p>his life to the elders from Ephesus as running in a race course. His goal was </p>
<p>to “complete his race course and the ministry” that he received from the </p>
<p>Lord Jesus (Acts 20:24). Ancient foot races were not run in curved tracks </p>
<p>but in straight ones where runners xed their eyes on a post at the end of </p>
<p>the track, the goal.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>Paul’s goal was “to testify to the good news of God’s</p>
<p>grace” (Acts 20:24). He was seeking an imperishable prize. His running was </p>
<p>purposeful.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>Now, Paul was stating that he had nished the race course.</p>
<p>e last clause describes the completion of his goal: Paul has kept the faith </p>
<p>(4:7). Tēreō literally signies “to guard.”</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>It was oen used as a synonym</p>
<p>for “to obey,” as in 1 Timothy 6:14, “to keep (obey) the commandment(s).”</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul had lived consistently in obedience to the mandates of the faith. He </p>
<p>had exhorted Timothy to “keep” himself pure (1 Tim 5:22), as Paul kept </p>
<p>the faith pure. Following Jesus who asked the Father to “guard” or protect </p>
<p>from the evil one the people that he had given him (John 17:15), Paul had </p>
<p>protected the faith, the gospel he preached, from the falsehoods promoted </p>
<p>by the evil one.</p>
<p>To what does Paul look forward? Henceforth, the righteous crown is </p>
<p>laid up for me, which the Lord will grant to me in that day, the righteous </p>
<p>judge, and, not only to me, but also to all the ones having loved his ap-</p>
<p>pearing (4:8). Paul continues the athletic imagery, referring again to the </p>
<p>crown.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>In 2:5, the focus was how one competes. In 4:7–8, Paul’s focus is</p>
<p>the completion of the race. Every city-state had its athletic festival, includ-</p>
<p>ing Ephesus, which had its annual athletic games (the Ephesia).</p>
