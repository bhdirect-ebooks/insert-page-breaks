<p>2 Timothy 4154</p>
<p>and Prisca greet the believers in Corinth. ey are pastoring and teaching </p>
<p>a church which met in their home (1 Cor 16:19). Aer Emperor Claudius </p>
<p>dies in AD 54, they return to Rome. Paul describes them as coworkers, </p>
<p>colleagues in ministry who prepare believers for ministry and to whom </p>
<p>the churches were to be subject.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>In Rome, by AD 57, again they have a</p>
<p>church in their home (Rom 16:3–5). Paul reports they risked their own </p>
<p>“neck” on behalf of his life (Rom 16:4), using the image of an execution </p>
<p>where the prisoner “places” his/her neck “under” the sword.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>Like Paul,</p>
<p>they emphasized their ministry outreach to the Gentiles.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p> Aer Paul’s re-</p>
<p>lease from imprisonment in Rome, they had returned to Ephesus (almost </p>
<p>ten years aer Romans was written), most likely, with Timothy, to continue </p>
<p>their teaching ministry among the Gentiles.</p>
<p>Prisca and Aquila are remarkable for their ministering as a couple to-</p>
<p>gether and as equals. Even in a patriarchal culture, Priscilla was honored for </p>
<p>her teaching abilities. ey are always mentioned together and are always </p>
<p>ministering together. Both were tentmakers by trade, both oered hospital-</p>
<p>ity to Paul and to others, both were teachers, both traveled together, both </p>
<p>were church overseers, and both risked their lives for Paul. ey scheduled </p>
<p>their business so that they could take church leadership positions wher-</p>
<p>ever they went and oered their economic resources to other believers. </p>
<p>eir time, money, and lives were given over to the promotion of God’s </p>
<p>reign. Possibly they informed Paul of the spiritual condition of the Roman </p>
<p>churches before he wrote to the Romans. Paul had a special relationship </p>
<p>with them. ey are the rst people whom he greets in his letter to Rome. </p>
<p>ey have the most extensive description in Romans 16:3–15. Prisca and </p>
<p>Aquila ministered to many and were appreciated by many. ey are a won-</p>
<p>derful illustration of a couple who have taken seriously God’s mandate for a </p>
<p>married couple together to subdue the earth and have dominion over it.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remains of the homes of Prisca and Aquila are still recognized today </p>
<p>in Rome. Near the Tiber River, the Church of Saint Prisca, in the area of </p>
<p>Aventino, was built over the house of Prisca and Aquila. Archaeological </p>
<p>excavations have unearthed an early Roman Christian place of worship </p>
<p>139. See 2 Tim 4:11.</p>
<p>140. Hypotithēmi; Trachēlos refers to “the whole neck and throat, the back part of the </p>
<p>neck in human beings” (LSJ, 1811).</p>
<p>141. 2 Tim 4:17; Rom 16:4. Aquila and Prisca, as Jews, are partners with the Gentiles, </p>
<p>symbolizing the ideal of a united, mutually loving Jewish and Gentile church which Paul </p>
<p>extols to the Romans (Rom 1:16; 11:17–24; 15:7–16; Zahn 1953: 1:391).</p>
<p>142. Gen 1:28; Spencer 2009: 22–24.</p>
