<p>Introduction to Pastoral Letters2</p>
<p>I have done a close reading of the text. Like Luke, I have attempted to do </p>
<p>a thorough investigation, but one understandable to my readers. My hus-</p>
<p>band, as a theologian and a grammarian, graciously read the entire com-</p>
<p>mentary. I am a “scholar,” but I am also a believer with the simple faith of a </p>
<p>child (Luke 18:16–17). ese words, although those of the Apostle Paul, are </p>
<p>also God-breathed, I have, therefore, not read these letters as a skeptic, but </p>
<p>as someone who is in love with God, who inspired the words and thoughts, </p>
<p>and in sympathy with Paul, as a friend and colleague in ministry, who was </p>
<p>mentoring other ministers in very dicult situations.</p>
