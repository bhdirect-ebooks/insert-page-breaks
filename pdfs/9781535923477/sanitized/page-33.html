<p>elder also appear in other ancient literature. Philo concludes that the law-</p>
<p>giver should especially have four virtues: love of humanity (philanthrōpos), </p>
<p>love of justice (philodikaios), love of good (philagathos), and hatred of evil </p>
<p>(misoponēros).</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Two additional key characteristics of God are righteousness and ho-</p>
<p>liness. As early as the Pentateuch, Moses summarizes God’s character as </p>
<p>great: “God is trustworthy (pistos) and has no unrighteousness; righteous </p>
<p>(dikaios) and holy (hosios) is the Lord” (Deut 32:4), and, as late as Revela-</p>
<p>tion, an angel describes God as “righteous, the One who is and the One </p>
<p>who was, the Holy One” (Rev 16:5). Jesus too is described as “holy and </p>
<p>righteous” (Acts 3:14).</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>In the rst century, dikaios could refer to people</p>
<p>who observe societal rules.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>In the Bible, it refers to people who observe</p>
<p>God’s rules, like Noah, a “righteous human,” pleasing to God (Gen 6:10) or </p>
<p>Zechariah and Elizabeth “righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all </p>
<p>the commandments and regulations of the Lord” (Luke 1:6). </p>
<p>e opposite of righteous (1:8) is lawless and disobedient, godless, </p>
<p>sinful, and unholy (Titus 2:12; 1 Tim 1:9), as the wild and disobedient child </p>
<p>(Titus 1:6). Righteousness is a characteristic people may have and yet will </p>
<p>pursue but never perfect (1 Tim 6:11; 2 Tim 3:16). Human works of righ-</p>
<p>teousness cannot save; only Jesus, the perfect Righteous One, can die for </p>
<p>the unrighteous to bring them to God (Titus 3:5–7; 1 Pet 3:18). Neverthe-</p>
<p>less, the new believer is instructed to live according to God’s likeness in </p>
<p>“true righteousness and holiness” (Eph 4:24). </p>
<p>How is anyone to avoid self-pleasure, anger, drunkenness, ghts, </p>
<p>shameful gain but to pursue hospitality, loving what is good, acting wisely, </p>
<p>righteously, and in a holy manner? Self-control is the key. Self-control </p>
<p>(1:8), to have power over oneself,</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>is one of the fruits of the Spirit, which is</p>
<p>made possible by crucifying the esh with its passions while being guided </p>
<p>by the Spirit (Gal 5:23–25). It is a characteristic of winning athletes (1 </p>
<p>Cor 9:25). e persons with power over themselves are guided by holding </p>

<p>most just . . . who is reputed to have been the rst to civilize the island by establishing </p>
<p>laws . . . and by setting up constitutions.” In ancient times, according to Strabo, Crete had </p>
<p>“good laws,” but later “it changed very much for the worse” when it began piracy (Strabo, </p>
<p>Geogr. 10.4.8–9 [C476-C477]; Plato, Leg. I.624–25A, 631B); TLNT 3:438. See also Titus </p>
