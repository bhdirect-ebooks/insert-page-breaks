<p>2 Timothy 188</p>
<p>us from God’s love has been abolished (Rom 8:38–39). But, death, the last </p>
<p>enemy, will be completely made inoperative at the very end of time (1 Cor </p>
<p>15:24–26; Rev 20:14).</p>
<p>Paul has just presented a synopsis of the gospel, which has to do </p>
<p>with life and immortality, rather than death (1:9–10). Paul now ends this </p>
<p>extended main clause (1:8–11) with an adjectival clause, for this gospel </p>
<p>I myself was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher (1:11). </p>
<p>Previously mentioned in 1 Timothy 2:7,</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>these three roles also follow a</p>
<p>synopsis of the good news (1 Tim 2:4–6). is gospel (2 Tim 1:9–10) is so </p>
<p>marvelous, it is worthy of Paul’s appointment (1:11) and it is worth suer-</p>
<p>ing for (1:12). Consequently, Paul says he is not ashamed—he is a prisoner </p>
<p>(1:12)—as he had exhorted Timothy not to be ashamed.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>Paul reiterates</p>
<p>why he is not ashamed, because he knows two things: for I know in whom </p>
<p>I trusted and I am persuaded that he is powerful to guard my deposit </p>
<p>into that day (1:12). In the past, Paul has trusted and continues to trust </p>
<p>the Savior Christ Jesus who appeared, made death ineective, and brought </p>
<p>life and immortality (1:10). How appropriate to trust someone victorious </p>
<p>over death as one faces one’s own death! Jesus is trustworthy. Jesus is also </p>
<p>powerful (1:12). He is powerful to guard until the second coming (that </p>
<p>day) Paul’s deposit (1:12). Elsewhere, Paul exhorts Timothy to guard “the </p>
<p>deposit” (1 Tim 6:20), which appears to be the order of love from a clean </p>
<p>heart and a good conscience and a genuine faith (1 Tim 1:5, 18).</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>In light</p>
<p>of the historical context and the theme of suering, Paul may be saying </p>
<p>that his gospel message will not be imprisoned, even though he is.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>message that has been given to him (my deposit) is also guarded by Jesus </p>
<p>himself.</p>
<p>51. See 1 Tim 2:7 (Spencer 2013). </p>
<p>52. See 1 Tim 1:8 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>53. See 1 Tim 6:20 (Spencer 2013). Is the deposit the gospel? Does Jesus guard the </p>
<p>gospel, which God entrusted to Paul, who in turn entrusted it to Timothy, who will in </p>
<p>turn entrust it to others (2:2)? E.g., Dibelius and Conzelmann 1972: 105. Or, is “deposit” </p>
<p>a metaphor for Paul’s own life or Paul’s own commitment to Christ and his gospel? E.g., </p>
<p>Fee 1988: 232; Mounce 2000: 488. Witherington III suggests “my deposit” might refer to </p>
<p>people in Paul’s charge (2006: 320). Any of these interpretations is possible.</p>
<p>54. See also Acts 28:31.</p>
