<p>Titus 118</p>
<p>a companion to a person given to anger can encourage one to be irascible </p>
<p>too (Prov 22:24–25).</p>
<p>56</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e components of aischrokerdēs (1:7) occur later in Titus (1:11, </p>
<p>aischros kerdos) to describe those of the circumcision party who overturn </p>
<p>whole households because of shameful gain. Aischrokerdēs is also used for </p>
<p>“deacons” in 1 Timothy 3:8. Aphilargyros (the quality for an overseer in 1 </p>
<p>Tim 3:3 and any believer in Heb 13:5) clearly refers to “not loving money.”</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Aischrokerdēs is a broader term.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p> Josephus uses aischrokerdeia for deceit-</p>
<p>ful nancial gain (Life 13 [75]). Polybius sees the love for “shameful gain” </p>
<p>(aischrokerdeia) and lust for wealth to prevail among the Cretans. ey are </p>
<p>“the only people in the world in whose eyes no gain is disgraceful” (Hist. </p>
<p>6.46.3–4). Because the state allows them to acquire as much land as they </p>
<p>want, he accuses them of having an “ingrained lust of wealth” that causes </p>
<p>“constant broils both public and private, and in murders and civil wars” </p>
<p>(Hist. 6.46.9; 47.5). us, Paul’s requirement for an elder/overseer not to </p>
<p>desire “shameful gain” would especially be signicant in Crete. In contrast, </p>
<p>for God’s stewards to be trustworthy, they must not shamelessly and deceit-</p>
<p>fully seek their own gain or prot. </p>
<p>Sitting long drinking wine (not given to getting drunk; paroinos)</p>

<p> </p>
<p>and ghting (not pugnacious; plēktēs, 1:7) are r<span class="_ _1" />elated w<span class="_ _1" />ords, becau<span class="_ _1" />se s<span class="_ _2" />ome<span class="ws1">-</span></p>
<p>times excessive drinking can lessen inhibitions that cover more hidden ag-</p>
<p>gressive emotions, especially if a person is prone to anger anyway (orgilos). </p>
<p>If the overseer begins with a foundation of pleasing oneself, instead of God, </p>
<p>and to this foundation is added a tendency to be angry without good cause, </p>
<p>impelled by intoxication and readiness to ght, no wonder the end would </p>
<p>be shameless self-gain (aischrokerdēs). </p>
<p>In contrast, the trustworthy household manager is hospitable (philox-</p>
<p>enos), loving what is good (philagathos) (not intoxicants or self-gain), is </p>
<p>wise (sōphrōn), righteous (dikaios, dikaia), holy (hosios, hosia), and cer-</p>
<p>tainly self-controlled (1:8). Some of these positive qualities for an overseer/</p>
<p>56. See 1 Tim 3:2–3 for explanation of paroinos (“given to getting drunk”), plēktēs </p>
<p>(“not pugnacious”), philoxenos (“hospitable”), and sōphrōn (“wise”) (Spencer 2013). </p>
<p>57 Literally, “not [a] loving [philos] silver [argyros] .”</p>
<p>58. Literally, “shameful gain” (aischros + kerdos) or “sordidly greedy of gain.” e verb </p>
<p>kerdainō can refer to nancial prot (e.g., Jas 4:13). </p>
<p>59. A typical Minoan touch in harvest festival vases is “the celebrant who has had too </p>
<p>much to drink and has fallen almost at on his face” (Gordon 1987: 333). e Cretans </p>
<p>claimed that Dionysus, the wine god, was born in Crete (Diodorys 5. 75. 4–5). Xenophon </p>
<p>points out that drink makes estate managers “forget everything they ought to do” (Oec. </p>
<p>12.11).</p>
