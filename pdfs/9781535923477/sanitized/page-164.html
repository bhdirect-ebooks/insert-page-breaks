<p>e historian Tacitus mentions the conviction of “vast numbers” </p>
<p>of Christians who were arrested and, “on their disclosures,” convicted to </p>
<p>squelch the rumor that Nero had ordered the re in Rome (Ann. 15.44). In </p>
<p>addition, Tacitus adds that their convictions were not so much because of </p>
<p>the charge of “arson as for hatred of the human race.” Suetonius mentions </p>
<p>the punishment of Christians as a permanent practice. Ramsay explains </p>
<p>that Suetonius “considered Nero to have maintained a steady prosecution </p>
<p>of a mischievous class of persons, in virtue of his duty to maintain peace </p>
<p>and order in the city, and to have intended that this persecution should </p>
<p>be permanent.”</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>e Romans felt that the Christians were turning them</p>
<p>from their ancestral ways, Roman manners and laws, customs, and reli-</p>
<p>gious beliefs. Christians “were bent on relaxing the bonds that held society </p>
together; they introduced divisions into families, and set children against
<p>their parents.”</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>Christianity greatly inuenced its converts, resulting in</p>
<p>marvelous reformations, enthusiastic devotion, and unbending resolu-</p>
<p>tions. To be able to have such changes implied to some the practice of </p>
magic. e persecution of Nero began by diverting popular attention, but
<p>it “continued as a permanent police measure under the form of a general </p>
<p>prosecution of Christians as a sect dangerous to the public safety.”</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>Active</p>
<p>persecution of Christians persisted between AD 64–66 but became spo-</p>
<p>radic between 66–68. Sulpicius Severus wrote that Nero’s persecution in 64 </p>
<p>was “the beginning of severe measures against the Christians. Aerwards </p>
<p>the religion was forbidden by formal laws.”</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>Even when Nero le Rome</p>
<p>in AD 66, the prefect of the city would still be bound to follow the example </p>
<p>set by the Emperor. Moreover, Nero’s action served as a precedent to guide </p>
<p>the actions of all Roman ocials in every province toward the Christians. </p>
<p>ere would be no need for a general edict or a formal law. In contrast, in </p>

<p>Tim 4:16 refers to the rst imprisonment (Hist. eccl. 2.22) but why would all desert him </p>
<p>since the procurators had said his case was excellent?</p>
