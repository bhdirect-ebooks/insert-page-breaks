<p>Fusing the Horizons: Coworkers</p>
<p>The Pastorals are letters that illustrate the work of team ministers and co-</p>
<p>workers, including not only Paul, Timothy, and Titus, but also Onesiphorus’ </p>
<p>household, Demas, Crescens, Luke, Mark, Tychicus, Carpus, Prisca, Aquila, </p>
<p>Erastus, Trophimus, Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, Claudia, Artemas, Zenas, and </p>
<p>Apollos. Paul has worked with his coworkers in a variety of ways. Some serve </p>
<p>as avant garde; others follow-up; some are replaced (Tychicus and Timothy). </p>
<p>Some travel Paul commissions (sends or designates). Other travel is uncom-</p>
<p>missioned (Crescens, Titus) and some is desertion (Demas). Thus, some co-</p>
<p>workers are faithful (Luke), others unfaithful. </p>
<p>Even as God is triune and a “team,” so is ministry in God’s name a team </p>
effort. Ministry teams have diverse people, in diverse stages of availability
<p>(e.g., illness limited Trophimus) and married and single people can take part </p>
<p>and they should all have one purpose: to promote the good news. Team mem-</p>
<p>bers can encourage each other in difﬁcult as well as daily situations, since no </p>
<p>one is too mature not to need a team.</p>
<p>Here are summarized some basic principles: </p>
<p>1. We need to know other Christians in order that their gifts can be discerned </p>
<p>and then used in a cooperative ministry.</p>
<p>2. We need a structure ﬂexible enough to allow different persons to come </p>
<p>into a church periodically as they are needed.</p>
<p>3. Team ministry is biblical. The lone-ranger minister is not a biblical </p>
<p>model. (Although even the Lone Ranger had Tonto.) Two is a minimum. </p>
<p>However, not all Christians have to be under our own authority or in our </p>
<p>program to be worth supporting or cooperating with.</p>
<p>4. Concern for a person and assistance in a ministry should be demonstrated </p>
<p>in material as well as emotional terms. Presence is important. </p>
