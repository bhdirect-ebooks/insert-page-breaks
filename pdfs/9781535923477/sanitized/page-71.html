<p>ships with Caesar’s household and the Praetorium Guard (Phil 1:13; 4:22). </p>
<p>At Ephesus, Paul was assisted by the Asiarchs, leaders in the province, and </p>
<p>the city clerk, the chief executive ocer (Acts 19:31, 35).</p>

<p> </p>
<p>en, the Cretans are to be, in other words, maintain good character. </p>
<p>ey are to be ready (or prepared, hetoimos) for every good work (3:1),</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>contrast to some besieged Jews, who were “ready (or prepared) for battle” </p>
<p>(1 Macc. 12:50). Titus 3:1 may be an allusion to Isaiah 40:3–4,</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>John the</p>
<p>Baptist’s call to the nation of Israel: “Prepare the way of the Lord, make </p>
<p>straight his paths” (Luke 3:4). John’s listeners were to prepare for the Lord </p>
<p>by making “straight” their own behavior (Luke 3:7–14). Here the church is </p>
<p>to prepare (be ready) for the Lord (Titus 2:11–13) by being prepared them-</p>
<p>selves to do any good action as necessary. ey were to be “soldiers” ready </p>
<p>to ght with wholesome weapons. Or, as Paul will exhort Timothy, vessels, </p>
<p>cleansed, ready to be used (2 Tim 2:21). Paul has already reminded Titus </p>
<p>that Jesus died so that he “might purify for himself” enthusiastic people of </p>
<p>good works (Titus 2:14).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Now he will elaborate some features of good action (3:2). While the </p>
<p>Christians might be slandered by others, they are not to lie, deceive, or </p>
<p>speak falsely of anyone.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Instead, they are to be people who are peaceable</p>
<p>(amachos) and gentle (epieikēs, 3:2), not “pugnacious” (Titus 1:7; 1 Tim </p>
<p>3:3). ese same qualities are necessary for all Christians (Titus 3:2). To </p>
<p>reinforce his point, Paul uses a synonym for “gentleness” (prautēs; show </p>
<p>humility) and explicitly mentions it should be demonstrated to all people </p>
<p>(3:2). Praus (noun) is a key characteristic of Jesus: “I am gentle (meek) and </p>
<p>humble in heart” (Matt 11:29).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>A gentle person gives rest and loads light</p>
<p>burdens (Matt 11:30). Paul exhorts the Corinthians by these two qualities </p>
<p>of Jesus: “humility and gentleness” (2 Cor 10:1), fruits of the Spirit (Gal </p>
<p>5:23).</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> is is the way to correct sinners (1 Cor 4:21; Gal 6:1) and oppo-</p>
<p>nents (2 Tim 2:25; 1 Pet 3:16). Gentleness might be shown with the use of a </p>

<p>6. Paul emphasizes the prepositional phrase “for every good work” by placing it rst, </p>
<p>in contrast to Clement who reorganizes the phrase into normal Greek word order (1 </p>
<p>Clem. 2:7). According to the TLG (8 April 2010), no one before Paul used this same </p>
<p>combination of three words (ready for every good work).</p>
