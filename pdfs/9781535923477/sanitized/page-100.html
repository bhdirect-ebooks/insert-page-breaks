<p>2 Timothy 186</p>
<p>(Heb 12:2)? Peter reiterates: suering as a Christian is not shameful (1 Pet </p>
<p>4:16). Jesus taught that, if he had been persecuted, so would be his disciples </p>
<p>(John 15:20; 2 Tim 3:12).</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul uses a unique word. Join in suering is one word in Greek </p>
<p>(synkakopatheō).</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>Kakopatheō (“suer”) without the preposition “with” is</p>
<p>also repeated later in the letter to describe Paul’s own suering from his </p>
<p>imprisonment and to challenge Timothy to endure suering (2:9; 4:5; 1:12 </p>
<p>paschō). e use of the preposition sun accentuates to “suer together with </p>
<p>someone.”</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>Paul describes by the preposition (“with”) how a communal</p>
<p>aspect helps the suerer in the midst of suering.</p>
<p>However, Paul and Timothy and other believers are not to “join in suf-</p>
<p>fering” simply for their own interpersonal enrichment, but for the gospel. </p>
<p>Paul invites others to join him because he is inviting them to follow their </p>
<p>crucied Messiah. But, how can Paul and Timothy have the strength to </p>
<p>suer for the gospel? ey can only do so according to God’s power (1:8). </p>
<p>What is that power or strength? Paul describes it in an extended modi-</p>
<p>er: the one having saved us and called us to a holy calling, not accord-</p>
<p>ing to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, the one </p>
<p>having been given to us in Christ Jesus starting from eternal times, on </p>
<p>the one hand, having been revealed now through the appearing of our </p>
<p>Savior Christ Jesus, on the other hand, having abolished death but hav-</p>
<p>ing brought to light life and immortality through the gospel (1:9–10). </p>
<p>God’s power accomplished several things: it saved us and called us to a </p>
<p>holy calling (1:9).</p>
<p>41</p>
<p> at calling is one not based on one’s own works, ac-</p>
<p>complishments or actions (i.e., suering for the gospel in itself does not </p>
<p>save). Rather, it is a calling according to God’s own purpose</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>and grace.</p>
<p>God’s grace contrasts with our works. Paul further describes the grace in </p>
<p>four ways: the one (1) having been given to us in Christ Jesus before eternal </p>
<p>times; (2) having been revealed now through the appearing of our Savior </p>
<p>Christ Jesus; (3) having abolished death; and (4) having brought to light life </p>
<p>and immortality through the gospel. Paul begins and ends this pericope </p>
<p>referring to the gospel (1:8, 10). e calling has four actions in time. First, </p>
