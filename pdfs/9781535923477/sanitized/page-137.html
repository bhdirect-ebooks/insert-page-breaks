<p>Timothy Needs to Continue in Ministry despite Opposition (3:1—4:8) </p>
<p>123</p>
<p>Timothy 3:6, sin has been heaped upon these women. ese women have </p>
<p>never comprehended the nature of the gospel that Christ Jesus came into </p>
<p>the world to save sinners and, therefore, is merciful to every sinner.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>ey</p>
<p>have not been freed. ey continue to sin. ey are led, not by God, but, </p>
<p>by manifold passions. Paul had previously warned Timothy to ee “youth-</p>
<p>ful passions” (2:22), strong feelings and desires turned upon something or </p>
<p>someone inappropriate. Paul does not specify what kind of passions the </p>
<p>women have. It could be sexual or nancial</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>or dierent since they are</p>
<p>manifold, but they are not good desires.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>As a result, despite Paul’s goal</p>
<p>for everyone, but especially women who have not been educated properly</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(i.e., although they learn by study [manthanō]), they have not reached the </p>
<p>goal: knowledge of truth (3:7).</p>
<p>Paul then compares these false teachers to Jannes and Jambres: But </p>
<p>just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, in the same way also they </p>
<p>themselves oppose the truth, humans who corrupted the mind, discred-</p>
<p>ited concerning the faith. But they will not advance any more, for their </p>
<p>folly will be quite plain to all, as also happened to those persons (3:8–9). </p>
<p>Jannes and Jambres were names given to two of the magicians called in by </p>
<p>Pharaoh in Egypt to oppose Moses. Aer Aaron had turned his sta into a </p>
<p>snake, the court magicians were able to do the same, but then Aaron’s ser-</p>
<p>pent swallowed up theirs. Later, with the Lord’s help, when Aaron is able to </p>
<p>turn dust into gnats, the magicians could not copy that act. erefore, they </p>
<p>told Pharaoh: “is is the nger of God” (Exod 7:11–13; 8:18–19).</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>teachers at Ephesus, like Jannes and Jambres, may have appeared impres-</p>
<p>sive to these women, but in reality they were opposing the person(s) chosen </p>
<p>41. 1 Tim 1:13–16; also Titus 3:4–7.</p>
<p>42. See 1 Tim 3:11; 6:9 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>43. Also Titus 3:3.</p>
<p>44. See 1 Tim 2:4, 11 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>45. A number of later Jewish and Christian documents referred to Jannes and Jam-</p>
<p>bres (or Mambres). e Damascus Document (which may be earlier or contemporary </p>
<p>with 2 Tim) notes: “For in ancient times there arose Moses and Aaron, by the hand of the </p>
<p>prince of lights and Belial, with his cunning, raised up Jannes and his brother during the </p>
<p>rst deliverance of Israel” (CD V.17b–19). In the rst century BC/AD Pseudo-Philo wrote </p>
<p>that Jambres sinned in the days of Moses (47.1). In the rst through third centuries AD, </p>
<p>a book was written about Jannes and Jambres. Around the third or fourth century, the T. </p>
<p>Sol. said that Jannes and Jambres called to their aid the demon Abezethibtou when they </p>
<p>opposed Moses in Egypt. It said: “I am the adversary of Moses in (performing) wonders </p>
<p>and signs” (25.4). e Pythagorean philosopher, Numenius, refers to Jannes and Jambres </p>
<p>as “sacred scribes” who practiced “magic” (Eusebius, Praep. ev. 9.7–8).</p>
