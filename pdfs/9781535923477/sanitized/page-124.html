<p>2 Timothy 2110</p>
<p>evil (Acts 17:18, 32). e Sadducees, unlike the Pharisees, believed there </p>
<p>was no resurrection at all.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> Some, at the church in Corinth, like the Saddu-</p>
<p>cees, believed there was no resurrection from the dead (1 Cor 15:12). But, </p>
<p>Paul explains, if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised, </p>
<p>and people’s sins are unforgiven (1 Cor 15:16–17). Paul presents a correct </p>
<p>sequence: Christ is the rst to resurrect, then Christ returns, at which time </p>
<p>those who belong to Christ resurrect (1 Cor 15:23). Jesus and Paul con-</p>
<p>rmed the belief of most ancient Jews that there would be at the judgment </p>
<p>two resurrections: one to life, one to condemnation.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p> is is a foundation-</p>
<p>al doctrine (Heb 6:2), previously mentioned in this letter (2 Tim 2:8, 11). </p>
<p>Now, at Ephesus, Hymenaeus and Philetus had been promoting a dierent </p>
<p>slant on the resurrection claiming at some point in the past the resurrec-</p>
<p>tion occurred and this event has changed the state of aairs. In the ctional </p>
<p>second-century Acts of Paul and ecla, the author has the villains Demas </p>
<p>and Hermogenes hold to a similar view, believing that the resurrection has </p>
<p>already taken place in the children (14). Both cases seem to propose a type </p>
<p>of Gnosticism where “knowledge of the true God” results in resurrection </p>
<p>or reincarnation. We cannot fully understand this heresy of Hymenaeus </p>
<p>and Philetus, but it must have had ramications for human behavior. Pos-</p>
<p>sibly by believing the resurrection is past, they then thought judgment was </p>
<p>past.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> In that case, they might live immoral lives</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>or legalistic, ascetic</p>
<p>ones (1 Tim 1:9; 4:3). Sometimes those who propose excessive legalism are </p>
<p>the very people who live unrighteous or ungodly lives. eir rules are so </p>
<p>excessive, no one could ever obey them, including themselves.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> </p>
<p>us, Paul exhorts all who claim to be Christian, including Timothy: </p>
<p>Nevertheless, the rm foundation of God stands, having this seal: the </p>
<p>Lord has known the ones who are his, and all naming the Lord’s name </p>
<p>92. Matt 22:23; Mark 12:18; Luke 20:27; Acts 4:1–2; 23:6–8.</p>
<p>93. Luke 14:14; John 5:29; 11:24; Acts 24:15; 2 Macc 7:14.</p>
<p>94. 2 Clem 9.1 joins judgment and resurrection.</p>
<p>95. 1 Cor 15:32; 2 Tim 2:19, 22.</p>
<p>96. Also, Col 2:21–23. Commentators suggest that the resurrection already is past </p>
<p>could refer to these believers now living (1) in the resurrection age to come, which re-</p>
<p>quired celibacy and food restrictions, since in the resurrection there was no marriage </p>
<p>and no physical body (1 Tim 4:3; Matt 22:30; Mark 12:25; Luke 20:35–36); or (2) in the </p>
<p>spiritual resurrection stage that began with baptism. e later Menander claimed his </p>
<p>disciples received the resurrection by being baptized into him and thereby no longer </p>
<p>dying but being immortal (Irenaeus, Haer. 1.23.5) (Towner 2006: 527–29; Marshall 1999: </p>
<p>753; Lock 1924: 99; Fee 1988: 256; Bassler 1996: 152; Kelly 1963: 185). </p>
