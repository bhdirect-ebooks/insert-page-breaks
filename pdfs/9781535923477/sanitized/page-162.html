<p>2 Timothy 4148</p>
<p>He writes he le behind the books (4:13). A biblion could be as small </p>
<p>as a document</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> or as large as a complete book.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>In the New Testament,</p>
<p>the emphasis is a literal document one touches.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>A biblion, a strip of byblos</p>
<p>made of Egyptian papyrus, could be a tablet, petition, book, and in the </p>
<p>plural even a library.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>Literary works made into scrolls did not usually</p>
<p>exceed thirty-ve feet. Membrana (a parchment scroll or codex notebook) </p>
<p>were made from the skins of cattle, sheep, and goats. Quality parchment </p>
<p>was developed in Pergamum in Mysia. It was more durable than papyrus </p>
<p>and could be written on both sides of a sheet, washed o, and reused.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many commentators have theorized that the biblia made of papyrus were </p>
<p>copies of the Old Testament and the membrana were copies of Paul’s own </p>
<p>letters. us, the rst collection of Paul’s letters might be Paul’s own pri-</p>
<p>vate collection.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>e phrase can be translated, the books, especially the</p>
<p>parchments, which implies two dierent types of books, those of papyrus </p>
<p>and parchment, or the books, namely, the parchment ones, which implies </p>
<p>one type of books. At a minimum, Timothy had to transport Paul’s library </p>
<p>to the prison in Rome, especially the most durable ones, the ones made of </p>
<p>parchment.</p>
<p>Paul warns Timothy: Alexander, the metalworker, did much evil to </p>
<p>me; the Lord will repay him according to his works; from whom also </p>
<p>keep yourself away, for exceedingly he stood against our words (4:14–</p>
<p>15). e New Testament cites several Alexanders: son of Simon (Mark </p>
<p>15:21), high priest family member (Acts 4:6), a Jew in Ephesus who tried to </p>
<p>make a defense before the mob (Acts 19:33–34), and a person in the church </p>
<p>at Ephesus who by rejecting conscience made a shipwreck of his faith.</p>

100. E.g., a certicate of divorce (Matt 19:7; Mark 10:4).
<p>101. E.g., the Gospel of John (John 20:30; 21:25); the book of Isaiah (Luke 4:17, 20); </p>
<p>the book of Revelation (Rev 1:11; 22:7, 9–10, 18–19).</p>
<p>102. A biblos emphasizes a literary work one reads (MM, 111). A biblos or byblos may </p>
<p>also serve as a synonym for biblion, e.g., the book of Isaiah (Luke 3:4); the book of Psalms </p>
<p>(Luke 20:42; Acts 1:20).</p>

<p>leaf-book made of parchment, widely used for notebooks, account books, and rst dras </p>
<p>of literary works (1963: 216). </p>
