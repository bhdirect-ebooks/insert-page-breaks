<p>Come Soon (4:9–18)</p>
<p>143</p>
<p>disturbing coworker is Demas.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p> Demas, like Luke, was probably a Gen-</p>
<p>tile.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>He, along with Luke, had kept Paul company during the rst Roman</p>
<p>imprisonment, when Paul was under house arrest.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>Paul describes Demas</p>
<p>as: he has abandoned me (4:10). Enkataleipō (abandon) is an intensive </p>
<p>word, signifying “to leave behind in the lurch or in straits” or “leave in the </p>
<p>lurch one who is in straits,” thus, “abandon.”</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>Jesus cried out in Aramaic</p>
<p>when on the cross: “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?”</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul had described his and Timothy’s ministry as “being persecuted but not </p>
<p>abandoned” (2 Cor 4:9). But, now, Paul felt abandoned in Rome by Demas. </p>
<p>In contrast to those who love Jesus’ appearing (4:8), Demas loved the pres-</p>
<p>ent age.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>He would not join Paul in suering. He would not carry his cross</p>
<p>with Jesus. He did not want to take the chance that he be imprisoned along </p>
<p>with Paul. He probably returned home to essalonica in Macedonia.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>When times became dicult, Demas no longer heeded the message </p>
<p>Paul had given the essalonians, that they imitate Paul, Silvanus (Silas), </p>
<p>70. Dēmas is probably a nickname for Dēmētrios, Dēmarchos, Dēmaratos, or </p>
<p>Dēmodokos (Robertson 1934: 172; ayer, 132; BDAG, 222).</p>
<p>71. ey are contrasted with Jews (Col 4:11–14).</p>
<p>72. Col 4:14; Phlm 24. Demas appears to be known by the Colossians although he </p>
<p>was not one of them (Col 4:12–14). Demas, like Luke and Mark, was a “coworker” (syn-</p>
<p>ergos), a colleague in ministry with Paul, to whom the churches were to be subject, who </p>
<p>prepares believers for ministry (1 Cor 16:15–16; Eph 4:11–12; Spencer 1985: 118; Ellis </p>
<p>1971: 437–52). Demas, along with Hermogenes, were included in the ctional second-</p>
<p>century Acts of Paul and ecla as fellow travelers with Paul to Iconium who were jealous </p>
<p>of Onesiphorus and full of hypocrisy and attery. e presbyter of Asia Minor has them </p>
<p>espouse the doctrine that the resurrection has already taken place (Acts of Paul 1, 4, 12, </p>
<p>14; 2 Tim 2:18).</p>
<p>73. ayer, 166; LSJ, 470; MM, 179. Also, 2 Tim 1:15.</p>
<p>74. Matt 27:46; Mark 15:34, citing Ps 22:1.</p>
<p>75. E.g., 1 John 2:15; Titus 2:12.</p>
<p>76. “Demetrius” was a common name in essalonica (Zahn 1953: 1:213, 441).es-</p>
<p>salonica, the capital of the province of Macedonia, was (and still is) a ourishing com-</p>
<p>mercial and political center situated right on the ermaic Gulf. e Via Egnatia crossed </p>
<p>it. It was the most populous city in Macedonia, a “free city” that did not have to pay taxes </p>
<p>to Rome but could levy taxes and conduct its own internal aairs (Strabo, Geogr. 7.7.4 </p>
<p>[C323]; Donaldson 1985: 259–60). Paul visited essalonica in his second and third mis-</p>
<p>sionary journeys (Acts 17:1–9; 20:1–2). Many devout Greek men and women and some </p>
<p>Jews were persuaded. However, a mob tried to harm Paul and Silas, but they escaped to </p>
<p>Beroea. Some unbelieving essalonians even pursued them there (Acts 17:3–5, 10, 13). </p>
<p>Other believing essalonians later accompanied Paul to Jerusalem when he brought the </p>
<p>oering (Acts 20:4). Aristarchus, a essalonian, stayed with Paul during the rst house </p>
<p>arrest (Acts 27:2; Phlm 24).</p>
