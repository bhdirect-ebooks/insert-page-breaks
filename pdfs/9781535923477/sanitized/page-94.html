<p>2 Timothy 180</p>
<p>“beloved” for many specic Christian believers</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> and for many churches,</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Timothy is the only beloved child. Also, “beloved child” presages the ad-</p>
<p>vice Paul will pass on to Timothy in this letter, as father passes advice to a </p>
<p>son.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Moreover, in itself, “beloved” calls out to Timothy to respond because</p>
<p>love evokes love since Paul will exhort Timothy to do some dicult actions </p>
<p>(such as share in suering).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Timothy Should Not Be Ashamed to Suffer (1:3—2:13)</p>
<p>Paul’s main point of the rst section of his letter is to exhort Timothy not to </p>
<p>be ashamed to suer for the gospel, nor of Paul suering (1:3—2:13). Paul </p>
<p>gives three reasons: (a) Timothy should not be ashamed because of his faith </p>
<p>and heritage (1:3–7); (b) Timothy should not be ashamed because of the </p>
<p>gospel and Paul’s own example and teaching (1:8–14); (c) Timothy should </p>
<p>follow the example of those of Onesiphorus’ household, who were ashamed </p>
<p>not of Paul’s chains, instead of others in Asia who turned away from him </p>
<p>(1:15–18). erefore, Timothy also should share in suering (2:1–13).</p>
<p>Paul anks God (1:3–5)</p>
<p>While in 1 Timothy 1:3–4 Paul jumps right into his concern about the her-</p>
<p>esies at Ephesus and the following of his previous directions to Timothy, </p>
<p>in 2 Timothy 1:3–5 Paul begins with an armation of Timothy: I have </p>
<p>gratitude to God, to whom I serve from my parents’ time in a clean con-</p>
<p>science, as I have unceasing remembrance concerning you in my prayers </p>
<p>by night and by day, longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I </p>
<p>might be lled with joy, having remembered the genuine faith in you, </p>
<p>which dwelled rst in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eu-</p>
<p>nice and I am persuaded also in you (1:3–5). </p>

<p>mon (Rom 16:5, 8, 9, 12; Eph 6:21; Col 1:7; 4:7, 9, 14; Phlm 1, 16).</p>
<p>8. Rome, Corinth, Philippi (Rom 1:7; 12:19; 1 Cor 10:14; 15:58; 2 Cor 7:1; 12:19; </p>
<p>Phil 2:12; 4:1).</p>
<p>9. E.g., 1:13–14; 2:22; 3:10–14.</p>
<p>10. Beloved is also a term used to describe all believers in God’s new covenant as </p>
<p>beloved brothers and sisters, not masters and slaves or servants (Rom 11:27–29; 1 Tim </p>
<p>6:2; Phlm 16; Jas 2:5). Grace, mercy, peace from Father-God and Christ Jesus our Lord </p>
<p>(1:2) is the same greeting used in 1 Tim 1:2. See 1 Tim 1:2 (Spencer 2013).</p>
