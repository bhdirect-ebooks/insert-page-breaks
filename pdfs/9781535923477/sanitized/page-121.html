<p>Avoid Ungodly Talking, BecomeaVesselforGoodWorks(2:14–26)</p>

<p>straight paths, as opposed to ungodliness (Prov 11:5). e word of truth is </p>
<p>used for the gospel orally communicated</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>in the New Testament. It may</p>
<p>also be in written form, but when it is correctly interpreted, it directs their </p>
<p>paths in the right direction, so that orthotomeō (“straight-cutting”) then </p>
<p>aects orthopodeō (“straight-walking”).</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>e opposite of falsifying God’s</p>
<p>word by shameful and deceptive means (2 Cor 4:2) is handling it correctly.</p>
<p>Such handling of the word of truth was not occurring in Ephesus. </p>
<p>So, Timothy needs to keep avoiding the godless empty talk; for they will </p>
<p>increase to more ungodliness and their word as a spreading gangrene </p>
<p>will increase, among whom are both Hymenaeus and Philetus, who, </p>
<p>concerning the truth, have deviated, saying, the resurrection already </p>
<p>is past, and they are upsetting the faith of some (2:16–18).</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>All three</p>
<p>Pastoral Letters have similar descriptions of the heresies (see table on the </p>
<p>following page).</p>
<p>e dierence is that 2 Timothy does not specically refer to genealo-</p>
<p>gies, a negative use of the law,</p>
<p>82</p>
<p> deling of the conscience,</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>ascetism, and</p>
<p>the circumcision party. us, either Paul did not repeat in his second letter </p>
<p>to Timothy every aspect of the problems in Ephesus or there have been </p>
<p>improvements in some areas since his previous letter around three to four </p>
<p>years earlier. What does remain consistent are word-battles, empty talk, </p>
<p>heresy, deception, women’s involvement, unhealthy self-serving teaching, </p>
<p>myths, harm, demonic aspects, godless behavior, and false piety.</p>
<p>79. Eph 1:13; Col 1:5; Jas 1:18. LSJ, 1250; ayer, 453.</p>
<p>80. Gal 2:14; Acts 14:10; Heb 12:13.</p>
<p>81. See 1 Tim 1:9; 6:20 (Spencer 2013); Titus 3:9. Godless (bebēlos) acts are unholy </p>
<p>ones that lead to lack of piety and empty talk (kenophōnia) are sounds that are empty or </p>
<p>without a truthful goal and therefore deceive. Titus 3:9 also refers to arguments, conten-</p>
<p>tions, and battles as does 2 Tim 2:14, 16–18. 1 Tim 6:20 also refers to “godless” (bebēlos) </p>
<p>and “empty talk” (kenophōnia).</p>
<p>82. 2 Tim 2:5 vs. 1 Tim 1:8–10; Titus 3:9.</p>
<p>83. Although Paul does refer to his “clean conscience” in 2 Tim 1:3.</p>
