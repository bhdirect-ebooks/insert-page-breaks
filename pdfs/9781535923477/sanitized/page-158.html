<p>and Timothy, a word they had received with joy in spite of persecution (1 </p>
<p>ess 1:6). Paul had warned them that they would suer persecution, as did </p>
<p>Christ Jesus, the prophets, and Paul and Silas (and Jason).</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>Even though</p>
<p>Paul wrote extensively about the future of Jesus’ return,</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>Demas preferred</p>
<p>the present world. Unfortunately, he did not hold fast to what he was taught </p>
<p>(2 ess 2:15). </p>
<p>Crescens</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>and Titus (4:10) are not described as having abandoned</p>
<p>Paul and loving the present age, but they leave to dierent regions, one to </p>
<p>Gaul or Galatia, one to Dalmatia, the southern part of Illyricum. Titus, </p>
<p>like Demas and Luke, was a Gentile.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>He had been in Crete two to ve</p>
<p>years earlier and was to have met Paul at Nicopolis (Titus 3:12). Dalmatia </p>
<p>is not far from Nicopolis. Possibly, Titus felt some urgency in returning </p>
<p>to the area of Illyricum (Rom 15:19). Titus was a coworker of Paul but he </p>
<p>was not in a hierarchical relationship with him. Paul had “le” Titus in </p>
<p>Crete but did not “send” him to Corinth.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> As Titus was a responsible, com-</p>
<p>mitted, mature Christian with the gi of organization and peacemaking, it </p>
<p>is dicult to believe he would abandon Paul, but possibly his strength in </p>
<p>organization might not gi him for the intensive personal support that Paul </p>
<p>needed at this time. </p>
<p>en comes the brief sentence lled with so much pathos: Luke is </p>
<p>only with me (4:11a). Even in suering for Christ’s sake, the follower of </p>
<p>Christ needs support, as Jesus needed support when he asked in Geth-</p>
<p>semane before the crucixion: “Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep </p>
<p>awake one hour?” (Mark 14:37; NRSV). In addition, the imprisoned person </p>
<p>needs material support. When Agrippa was imprisoned by Tiberius, Anto-</p>
<p>nia arranged certain concessions for him: the centurion handcued to him </p>
<p>would be humane, Agrippa would be allowed to bathe every day, receive </p>
<p>77. 1 ess 2:14–15; 3:3–4, 7; 2 ess 1:4–5; Acts 17:3.</p>
<p>78. 1 ess 4:14–17; 5:2–4, 23; 2 ess 1:7–10.</p>
<p>79. e Greek name is rare (BDAG, 566).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No additional information is given in the </p>
<p>NT on Crescens. Later traditions associate Crescens with Chalcedon (as bishop) in </p>
<p>northern Asia Minor, and with the founding of the churches in Vienne and Mayence </p>
<p>(Brownrigg 1971: 92; Baring-Gould 1898: 15:323; Zahn 1953: 2:26; Lock 1924: 117; Kelly </p>
<p>1963: 213; Mounce 2000: 590). Vienne is in Gaul. Gauls also migrated to Galatia. If Cre-</p>
<p>scens did go to Gaul and Titus to Dalmatia, they would be reaching out northwest and </p>
<p>northeast from Rome (Hendricksen 1957: 319; Zahn 1953: 2:11–12, 25). </p>
