<p>sincere faith (1 Tim 1:3–7; Titus 1:7). Mataios in Titus describes the lack </p>
<p>of value in discussing “foolish arguments and genealogies and contentions </p>
<p>and battles pertaining to the law” (3:9). Mataios is used in the New Testa-</p>
<p>ment to describe the pagan gods, like Zeus, who do not have the ability and </p>
<p>force to create the world (Acts 14:15) and the way Gentiles who believe in </p>
<p>such gods live and think.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>Mataios can also refer to lack of truth or value or</p>
<p>force,</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>as faith without the historic resurrection has no value (1 Cor 15:17;</p>
<p>also 1 Cor 3:20; Jas 1:26). In Titus 1:10, Paul describes those people whose </p>
<p>words have no value most likely because their content is not in accordance </p>
<p>with truth. Possibly, they go through a sequence of steps. First, they do </p>
<p>not subject themselves to healthy teaching and teachers (anypotaktos), then </p>
<p>their words become heterodox (mataiologos), and, nally, they deceive oth-</p>
<p>ers (phrenapatēs).</p>
<p>Eve is an illustration of someone who sinned because of deception,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>unlike Adam who sinned knowingly (1 Tim 2:14; 2 Cor 11:3). In Ephe-</p>
<p>sians, Paul warns his readers not to be deceived because of “empty words” </p>
<p>(Eph 5:6). Deception is based on untruthful information. For example, the </p>
<p>serpent misled Eve by suggesting to her that God had told her not to eat </p>
<p>from any tree in the garden, that she would not die, and that eating the </p>
<p>fruit would make her like God (Gen 3:1, 4–5). e serpent made God’s </p>
<p>commands (Gen 2:16–17) more strict and as well contradicted them. e </p>
<p>same process was likely true of the opponents at Crete, and especially “the </p>
<p>ones from the circumcision” (Titus 1:10). e Cretan mercenaries were so </p>
<p>well known for their art of deception, the ancients had a saying, “to play </p>
<p>the Cretan,” which meant to take every precaution and to examine a situ-</p>
<p>ation from every angle in order to deceive and vanquish one’s opponent </p>
<p>(Polybius, Hist. 8.19.5). </p>
<p>e deviation from the truth at Crete has many similarities with the </p>
<p>one at Ephesus. What is implied in Ephesus is explicit in Crete: the presence </p>
<p>of some people from the circumcision party.</p>
<p>69. Eph 4:17; Rom 1:21; 1 Pet 1:18. 2 Pet 2:10–19 describes such a lifestyle as one </p>
<p>that indulges in irrational passions of the esh, such as sexual immorality and greed, and </p>
<p>despises authority.</p>
