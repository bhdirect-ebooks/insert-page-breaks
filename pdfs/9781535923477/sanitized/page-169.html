<p>Greetings (4:19–22)</p>

<p>and Mithras worship. Peter stayed with them for a while.</p>
<p>143</p>
<p>Further outside</p>
<p>Rome, on the Via Salaria, an old Roman road used for commerce, near a </p>
<p>main gate was a villa owned by Prisca and Aquila. e property was later </p>
<p>donated by Prisca to the Christian community for burial (Catacombs of </p>
<p>Saint Priscilla).</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>In one of the oldest areas of the catacombs under the</p>
<p>original villa was found a burial inscription: “M(anio) Acilius c.v. (‘most </p>
<p>illustrious man’) . . . and Priscilla C. (f.) (‘most illustrious woman’).” “C.V.” </p>
<p>indicates that both of them belonged to families of senatorial rank, the fam-</p>
<p>ily of Acilius. Suetonius, in the Life of Domitian mentions that Emperor </p>
<p>Domitian (AD 81–96) condemned to death “many senators, some of whom </p>
<p>had been consuls, among them . . . Acilius Glabrione, the latter having been </p>
<p>exiled. ey were accused of wanting to introduce new things.” is gen-</p>
<p>eral charge, akin to that of atheism, would relate to the practice of calling </p>
<p>Christianity an entirely “new concept,” in contrast with that of idolatry, </p>
<p>“where the brotherhood of all who had been baptized was recognized, with </p>
<p>no discrimination for reasons of social condition or of national origin.” Ma-</p>
<p>nius Acilii Glabriones is a relative of Pudens.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>When Paul thanks Prisca</p>
<p>and Aquila because “they placed their own neck” to help him and also the </p>
<p>church of the Gentiles (Rom 16:3–4), possibly they used their senatorial </p>
<p>rank to speak to proconsul Gallio in Corinth before Paul was brought to </p>
<p>court, despite the danger of being themselves accused and executed (Acts </p>
<p>18:6–16).</p>
<p>146</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e household of Onesiphorus (4:19b), mentioned earlier, who had </p>
<p>visited Paul in Rome, was now in Ephesus.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>Paul mentions two coworkers</p>
<p>about whom Timothy might have been concerned or whom he expected </p>
<p>to be with Paul: Erastus remained in Corinth, and I le Trophimus in </p>
<p>143. e legend appears to confuse Prisca and Priscilla, describing Prisca, the daugh-</p>
<p>ter of Aquila and Priscilla, who accompanied Paul on missionary voyages, and was bap-</p>
<p>tized by Peter. (Roman children were regularly called by the same name as their parents </p>
<p>[Barnes 1933: 29–33; Morton 1937: 471].) In a similar manner, in some translations and </p>
<p>by Latin church father Ambrosiaster (AD 384), “Priscilla” replaces “Prisca” in 1 Cor </p>
<p>16:19 and in Rom 16:3. But, the earliest Greek mss. support “Prisca” in those references. </p>
<p>Peter later stayed on Via Nomentana near the Church of Saint Agnes (Barnes 1903: 34).</p>
<p>144. e pagans used to cremate the dead, but the Christians wanted to retain the </p>
<p>bones of the dead so that they would be ready to be resurrected at the last judgment. Rich </p>
<p>and poor were buried together in an egalitarian spirit.</p>
<p>145. Carletti 2007: 5, 9–11; Barnes 1903: 31–32.</p>
<p>146. Some traditions suggest that Aquila and Prisca went to Spain and were martyred </p>
<p>there (Baring-Gould 1898: 7:183).</p>
<p>147. See 2 Tim 1:16–18.</p>
