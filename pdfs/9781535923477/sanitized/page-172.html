<p>waterfront and nd a vessel scheduled to sail in the direction he wanted to </p>
<p>go, then book a passage with the master of the ship, oen applying for an </p>
<p>exit pass and waiting for the herald’s cry that the vessel was ready to leave.</p>

<p>Paul now closes with greetings from Christians in Rome: Eubulus </p>
<p>greets you and Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers </p>
<p>and sisters (4:21b). Even though many have abandoned Paul, he was not </p>
<p>abandoned by Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, and Claudia, and other believers. </p>
<p>Eubulus literally signies “prudent.”</p>
<p>160</p>
<p>Rome has signicant archaeological</p>
<p>and traditional information on Pudens and Claudia. Pudens was probably </p>
<p>a senator. A church was built over the home of Pudens and Claudia (now </p>
<p>the Basilica of Santa Pudenziana). ey had used their home for worship.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pudens was a member of the Acilii Glabriones family (probably related to </p>
<p>Aquila). His sons (Novatus and Timotheus) ran Roman thermal baths. </p>
<p>Pudens married Claudia, who was British. Aer being captured by Em-</p>
<p>peror Claudius and sent to Rome, the family was set at liberty, eventually </p>
<p>introducing Christianity into Britain.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p>According to a repeated tradition,</p>
<p>Peter lived in their house in AD 64. Pudens and Claudia’s daughters, Pu-</p>
<p>dentiana and Prassede (Praxedes) are remembered today by churches in </p>
<p>their names.</p>
<p>163</p>
<p>Linus, possibly an Italian from Tuscany, lived with Pudens.</p>
<p>He became the second bishop in Rome, aer Peter, and is buried near Peter </p>
<p>in the Vatican under St. Peter’s Basilica, where a con reads “Linus.” e </p>

<p>Testament. ese ve entities are presented in polysyndeton, treating each person or </p>

<p>162. Baring-Gould 1898: 9:82–86; 5:262. In contrast, other scholars conclude that </p>
<p>the Claudia in 2 Tim 4:21 is not this Claudia (Zahn 1953: 2:21). Lightfoot (1890: 77–79) </p>
<p>notes another tradition that considers Pudens’s wife to be Sabinella and mentions a dif-</p>
<p>ferent married Pudens and Claudia in the imperial household.</p>
<p>163. Aer her father Pudens, brother Novatus, and sister Pudentiana died, Prassede </p>
<p>used her wealth to build a church, where she concealed many Christians persecuted by </p>
<p>Emperor Antonius Pius. Pudens, Pudentiana, and eventually Prassede died as Christian </p>
<p>martyrs and were buried in the cemetery of St. Priscilla. However, later the remains of </p>
<p>Prassede and Pudentiana were removed by Pope Paschal I (ninth century) to the Basili-</p>
<p>cas of Saint Prassede and Saint Praxedes in Rome. e Basilica of Saint Praxedes also </p>
<p>honors the mother of Pope Paschal I, bishop (“Episcopa”) eodora.</p>
