<p>context, comparing these false teachers to destructive animals who destroy </p>
<p>people by attacking them and destroying their healthy faith.</p>
<p>Plato, in his dialogue about the ideal government, mentions how the </p>
<p>common meals and gymnasia in Crete (though benecial in many ways) </p>
<p>also could be quite harmful, corrupting “the pleasures of love which are </p>
<p>natural not to humans only but also natural to beasts” (thērion). He men-</p>
<p>tions that these state structures encouraged pleasures “contrary to nature </p>
<p>when male mates with male or female with female, and that those rst </p>
<p>guilty of such enormities were impelled by their slavery to pleasure. And </p>
<p>we all accuse the Cretans of concocting the story about Ganymede” (Leg. </p>
<p>I.636B–C). In this myth, Zeus, disguised as an eagle, takes Ganymede, a </p>
<p>handsome youth, tending his ock, away with him. Plato appears to allude </p>
<p>to a Cretan custom where a young man, with the aid of his friends, abducts </p>
<p>another young man. He is given presents and taken away where for two </p>
<p>months they feast and hunt. e abducted man is honored as “those who </p>
<p>were chosen as stand-bys,” the abductor is called “lover.”</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>However, not all</p>
<p>in the ancient world would see this practice as admirable—certainly Plato </p>
<p>did not (at least in this referral). Paul would not.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>e second descriptive phrase would also remind the reader of eating, </p>
<p>since gastēr refers to the belly or “paunch,” the belly, especially “as craving </p>
<p>food,” or “the womb.”</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the New Testament, gastēr only refers</p>
<p>to the wombs of pregnant women.</p>

<p>Argē, argos is used in 1 Tim 5:13 for</p>
<p>the young widows who do not pray but instead are idle, not having produc-</p>
<p>tive ways to spend their time. is is the same adjective that James uses </p>
<p>to describe faith without action. It is “fallow” (2:20 vs. 1:21 “implanted”). </p>
<p>Jesus uses it for laborers who have no work to do (Matt 20:3). erefore, the </p>
<p>phrase literally refers to “inactive bellies” or “stomachs that do not work” </p>
<p>(people who eat but do not use their energy for work) or “wombs that do </p>
<p>not bear children.” Consequently, evil beasts, idle bellies could allude to </p>
<p>the pleasure-seeking Cretan lifestyle. Polybius describes the Cretan “point </p>
<p>of view” to be one of only self-interest (Hist. 8.16.5–8). No wonder these </p>
<p>opponents were seeking their own shameful gain (1:7, 11).</p>
<p>How is it possible that those in the circumcision party could be </p>
<p>known for pleasure-seeking? Paul apparently thought it possible when </p>
