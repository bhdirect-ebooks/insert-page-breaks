<p>Keep Empowered and Entrust Paul’s Teachings (2:1–2)</p>

<p>eternal life (1:9–10, 13). He also learned from Paul the ramications of the </p>
<p>gospel, that it will entail suering (1:8). Timothy models Paul’s “way of life </p>
<p>in Christ” (1 Cor 4:17), that their diculties as believers demonstrate that </p>
<p>their “extraordinary power” must come from God (2 Cor 4:7).</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other agents that corroborate or support</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>what Timothy heard from</p>
<p>Paul are many witnesses.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Timothy witnessed Christ’s empowering but</p>
<p>dicult work in his travels and even while Paul had been in prison in Rome </p>
<p>previously. A witness might be a legal witness, acceptable in court, some-</p>
<p>one who can verify what he or she has seen or heard or known by any other </p>
<p>means.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Both the Old and New Testaments are founded on the principle</p>
<p>established in Deuteronomy: “By the mouth of two witnesses (not one), or </p>
<p>by the mouth of three witnesses, shall every word be established” (19:15). </p>
<p>is same principle works for historical witnesses.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> Paul had already ex-</p>
<p>horted Timothy in Ephesus to make sure women, not educated previously </p>
<p>in Jewish law, should now be educated (1 Tim 2:11). All were encouraged to </p>
<p>seek leadership positions in the church by becoming godly persons (1 Tim </p>
<p>3:1). Now Paul reiterates that message to Timothy to entrust the gospel </p>
<p>educational process to trustworthy humans. Part of the function of an el-</p>
<p>der is the ability to teach others (1 Tim 3:2). at same function is repeated </p>
<p>here (2 Tim 2:2). Nevertheless, Paul does not require that only elders teach. </p>
<p>Many people may have the gi of teaching (Rom 12:7; 1 Cor 12:28), some </p>
<p>of whom may become elders.</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy, Paul has entrusted the order of “love from a pure heart </p>
<p>and a good conscience and genuine faith” to Timothy (1:5, 18). Now he </p>
<p>wants him to entrust the order to others.</p>

<p>9. Jesus was conscious that he needed two or more witnesses to testify of his person </p>
<p>and life (John 5:31–39; 8:13–18; 10:25, 37–38; 15:26–27; 21:24). e Gospel of Luke </p>
<p>ends with Jesus’ commission to his disciples to testify of his teachings, that the Messiah </p>
<p>suered and rose from the dead and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be </p>
<p>proclaimed to all nations (24:44–48). e disciples testify to Jesus throughout the book </p>
<p>of Acts. In Acts, Paul and his coworkers spend much time discipling the new converts </p>
<p>and appointing elders for each church (e.g., Acts 14:23; 15:36).</p>

<p>when bread and sh are placed before someone to eat (ayer, 486). It is the cognate of </p>
