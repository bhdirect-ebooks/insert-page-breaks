<p>represented Christ as well, because, just as this household visited Paul (“the </p>
<p>least of these”) in prison, they were, in eect, visiting Jesus (Matt 25:40), </p>
<p>and they did so not just once but oen (many times).</p>

<p>from an evil spirit on Saul (1 Sam 16:23; LXX). Peter describes the Lord’s presence as </p>
<p>“refreshing” (Acts 3:20). See also 2 Cor 7:13; Phlm 7, 20.</p>
