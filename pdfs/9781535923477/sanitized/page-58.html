<p>are models for the younger women, Titus is a comparable model for the </p>
<p>younger men. ey are like “brothers” (1 Tim 5:1). Education by model is </p>
<p>a most eective means of communication, especially to those who are one’s </p>
<p>equal.</p>

<p>Comparison of the Models of Timothy and Titus</p>
<p>1 Timothy 4:12 </p>
<p>To all believers</p>
<p>Titus 2:7–8</p>
<p>To believing younger men</p>
<p>in word good works</p>
<p>in conduct in the teaching—pure</p>
<p>in love honorable</p>
<p>in faith beyond reproach in healthy message </p>
<p>in purity</p>
<p>e women at Ephesus were having more diculty with heterodoxy, </p>
<p>thus, Timothy has to be a model for all believers, whereas at Crete, the elder </p>
<p>women can share the educational burden with Titus. e rst priority for </p>
<p>Titus is orthopraxy (right action), in contrast to Timothy’s priority which is </p>
<p>orthodoxy (right doctrine). e opponents in Crete were confessing knowl-</p>
<p>edge of God but their actions did not demonstrate their beliefs (1:16). us, </p>
<p>Titus rst had to work on acting like a Christian. Titus’ good actions do </p>
<p>not save him (3:5), but they are the goal and evidence of salvation (2:14; </p>
<p>3:1, 8, 14). e second priority for Titus is teaching. Doctrine is important </p>
<p>in both Crete and Ephesus at this time. As elders must teach healthy doc-</p>
<p>trine (1:9), so must Titus (2:1, 7). e unhealthy teaching of the opponents </p>
<p>was overturning whole households (1:11). It was destructive. In contrast, </p>
<p>Titus’ teaching was not to be destructive (phtheirō), rather, indestructible </p>
<p>or uncorrupted, sound (2:7, aphthoria).</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>en, Titus was to be honorable</p>
<p>(semnotēs, 2:7), as the male elders (2:2). And, nally, even as his actions are </p>
<p>to be good, so must Titus’ words be healthy (sound) and without basis for </p>
<p>any to condemn (beyond reproach, akatagnōstos; 2:8). Not being open to </p>
<p>40. See 1 Tim 4:12. Elsewhere, models are Paul and Timothy as friends of the cross </p>
<p>of Christ (Phil 3:17); the church at essalonica for receiving the word with joy inspired </p>
<p>by the Holy Spirit in spite of persecution (1 ess 1:7); Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy for </p>
<p>working and not being idle (2 ess 3:9). Paul himself is a model (hypotypōsis) in 1 Tim </p>
<p>1:16.</p>
