<p>120</p>
<p>us, it appears as if Alexander’s accusation resulted in Paul’s arrest. </p>
<p>Despite the accusation and the lack of support, Paul was not convicted, but </p>
<p>neither was he freed. As a Roman citizen, he continued to appeal to the </p>
<p>Emperor’s tribunal.</p>
<p>Paul had reminded Timothy that the Lord had rescued him from all </p>
<p>the persecutions in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>Even though Paul had</p>
<p>at this rst trial been le abandoned (4:16), the Lord stood by</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>Paul and</p>
<p>strengthened him (4:17). Unlike humans, the Lord never abandons be-</p>
<p>cause God is a faithful, covenant-keeping God.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>God not only was present</p>
<p>with Paul but also strengthened or empowered him.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p> </p>
<p>God’s presence and strengthening had a goal: in order that through </p>
<p>me the proclamation might be fullled and all the Gentiles might hear </p>
<p>(4:17b). is was Paul’s ministry (cf. 4:5), to bring God’s name before Gen-</p>
<p>tiles and kings and the people of Israel.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p> As a result of the Lord’s empow-</p>
<p>erment, Paul was rescued out of the lion’s mouth (4:17c). e lion was a </p>
<p>symbol of strength</p>
<p>126</p>
<p> and condence,</p>
<p>127</p>
<p> but also death and destruction,</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>in, “[T]he people rise up like a lioness and they rouse themselves like a lion </p>
<p>that does not rest till it devours its prey and drinks the blood of its victims” </p>
<p>(Num 23:24; TNIV). e lion’s mouth would be the penultimate point of </p>
<p>destruction. In the Messianic Psalm 22, David describes his enemies: “ey </p>
<p>open wide their mouths at me, like a ravening and roaring lion” and cries </p>
<p>out, “Save me from the mouth of the lion” (vv. 13, 21)! Some rulers were </p>
<p>compared to roaring lions: “tearing the prey, they have devoured human </p>
<p>lives.”</p>
