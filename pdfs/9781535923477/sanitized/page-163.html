<p>Come Soon (4:9–18)</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>Some scholars have suggested that the Alexanders in Acts 19 and 2 Timo-</p>
<p>thy 4 were all the same person: “e character of this Alexander appears to </p>
<p>have been all too consistent with that of the other two references.”</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>scholars have suggested that only the Alexanders in the Pastorals are the </p>
<p>same. Paul describes “the same person in a dierent setting, and his expul-</p>
<p>sion from the church may have been the cause of his relocation to another </p>
<p>place where he continued to oppose the apostle.”</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>However, Paul may have</p>
<p>used the modier the metalworker to distinguish this Alexander from the </p>
<p>other two, especially the Alexander Paul had previously mentioned in 1 </p>
<p>Timothy 1:19–20.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>A chalkeus was a smith who worked in metal, such as</p>
<p>copper, iron, bronze, and brass.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>e smith’s trade was widespread in the</p>
<p>countryside. Smiths worked in tool rooms, temples, stables, on boats, and </p>
<p>irrigating machines.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p> e name Alexandros means “defender of men,”</p>
<p>112</p>
<p> </p>
<p>but he was no defender of Paul. Probably at Troas,</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>he harmed Paul. Paul</p>
<p>does not specify what evil Alexander manifested, but possibly he accused </p>
<p>Paul, thereby getting him arrested. is Alexander is so antagonistic to the </p>
<p>Christian teaching (our words), Paul warns Timothy to be on guard against </p>
<p>him (keep yourself away; 4:15). us, if Demas had been a passive oppo-</p>
<p>nent (4:9), Alexander was an active opponent (4:14–15).</p>
<p>Paul then concludes this section of his letter (4:9–18) by explaining </p>
<p>his legal situation: In my rst defense no one came to my aid, rather all </p>
<p>abandoned me; may it not be counted against them; but the Lord stood </p>
<p>by me and he strengthened me, in order that through me the proclama-</p>
<p>tion might be fullled and all the Gentiles might hear, and I was rescued </p>
<p>out of the lion’s mouth (4:16–17). Paul describes his legal defense, the rst </p>
<p>stage in his trial, the prima actio, a preliminary hearing before the emperor </p>
<p>or a magistrate that precedes the actual trial, secunda actio. e previous </p>
<p>time he had had a two-year delay aer the preliminary hearing (Acts 24:27; </p>
<p>107. Brownrigg 1971: 23.</p>
<p>108. Towner 2006: 631; Zahn 1953: 2:21–22; Kelly 1963: 216.</p>
<p>109. See also Hendricksen 1957: 324–25.</p>
<p>110. LSJ, 1973; BDAG, 1076; ayer, 664. Chalkeus is a dierent term than silver-</p>
<p>smith (Acts 19:24) and contrasts with gold and silver in the NT (Matt 10:9; Rev 18:12).</p>
<p>111. TLNT 3:497.</p>
<p>112. ayer, 26.</p>
<p>113. If Alexander was where Timothy was, why would Paul have to warn Timothy? </p>
<p>If Alexander was in Rome, why would Paul warn Timothy now rather than wait until he </p>
<p>arrived in Rome? (Zahn 1953: 2:16–17, 22). Also, an association of metalworkers existed </p>
<p>at Troas (Towner 2006: 631).</p>
