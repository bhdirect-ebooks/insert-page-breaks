<p>Proclaim the Word (4:1–6) </p>
<p>135</p>
<p>forgiveness of sins to all nations.”</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Jesus himself proclaimed, “Repent, for</p>
<p>the kingdom of heaven is near.”</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Timothy too will be proclaiming Jesus’</p>
<p>kingdom (4:1).</p>
<p>In this dicult time, the next key action is to take a stand in season, </p>
<p>out of season (4:2). Literally, take a stand means “to stand” (histēmi) “over” </p>
<p>(epi) or make a stand. Sometimes simply standing and waiting is enough, as </p>
<p>Cornelius’ emissaries were waiting at the gate</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> or someone may be stand-</p>
<p>ing, arming an action, as Paul armed the condemnation of Stephen </p>
<p>(Acts 22:20). But, Timothy is charged to remain rm in season (at good </p>
<p>times) and out of season (at bad times).</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> Timothy is to proclaim the gos-</p>
<p>pel, that is, take his stand, whether it is convenient or inconvenient, oppor-</p>
<p>tune or inopportune.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> And, he has no leisure to wait; he must be urgent.</p>
<p>In the same way as the Scripture reproves (3:16), Timothy too is to </p>
<p>bring deeds and thoughts out into the open for the sake of truth (Eph 5:11) </p>
<p>since proclamation of the word claries for hearers what is sin. A synonym </p>
<p>of reprove (elenchō) is rebuke (epitimaō). Epitamaō in the New Testament </p>
<p>oen means to order something or someone not to do something, to speak </p>
<p>or to act in a certain way.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>For example, Jesus told his disciples, if believers</p>
<p>sin, order them not to do so (rebuke, censure severely) but, if they repent, </p>
<p>forgive them (Luke 17:3). us, if sinful deeds are brought out in the open </p>
<p>(reprove or reveal), then the next step is to order the listener not to do them </p>
<p>(rebuke).</p>
<p>16. Luke 24:47. See 1 Tim 1:15 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>17. Matt 4:17, 23; 9:35; Luke 8:1.</p>
<p>18. Acts 10:17; 11:11.</p>
<p>19. Good versus bad times is a subjective decision. For instance, Judas Iscariot sought </p>
<p>a “good time” to betray Jesus (Matt 26:16; Mark 14:11; Luke 22:6). For Apollos to come </p>
<p>to Corinth during the midst of the arguments there was not a “good time” (1 Cor 16:12). </p>
<p>e disciples were so busy they could not nd an opportunity to eat (Mark 6:31). In </p>
<p>contrast, the Philippians took a while before they could arrange to send Paul money; </p>
<p>there had been no good time (Phil 4:10).</p>
<p>20. BDAG, 407; ayer, 259.</p>
<p>21. E.g., the disciples ordered adults not to bring their children to be blessed by Jesus </p>
<p>(Matt 19:13; Mark 10:13; Luke 18:15. Peter ordered Jesus not to say he would suer (Matt </p>
<p>16:21–22; Mark 8:31–32). Jesus ordered demons not to stay within people but to leave </p>
<p>(Matt 17:18; Mark 1:25–26; 9:25; Luke 4:35, 41; 9:42). He also ordered the winds and </p>
<p>waves not to be rough but to be calm and a fever to leave (Matt 8:26; Mark 4:39; Luke </p>
<p>4:39; 8:24).</p>
