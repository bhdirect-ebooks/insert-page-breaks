<p>visits from friends, have a bed, and other bodily comforts.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>Paul was in</p>
<p>prison and Luke visited and supported him (Matt 25:36). </p>
<p>Luke had felt called by God, along with Paul, Timothy, and Silas at </p>
<p>Troas in Asia Minor, by the Macedonian appealing in a vision. Luke, tak-</p>
<p>ing leadership in maintaining the newly established church, remained in </p>
<p>Philippi and returned with the large group that accompanied Paul with the </p>
<p>oering for the Jerusalem Christians.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>e Macedonian church had many</p>
<p>strong Christian women and Luke’s Gospel also emphasizes Jesus’ ministry </p>
<p>to women. us, Luke too must have been sympathetic to the leadership </p>
<p>of women in the church. Along with Aristarchus, Luke accompanied Paul </p>
<p>from Caesarea when he was sent to Rome and stayed with him during the </p>
<p>house arrest.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul describes Loukas, probably a nickname for Loukanos, as “the </p>
<p>beloved physician” (Col 4:14), one of his coworkers.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>“Beloved” indicates</p>
<p>Paul and Luke had a close and aectionate relationship. Possibly Luke as-</p>
<p>sisted Paul with his eye diculties.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p> Luke may have been a freed slave, be-</p>
<p>cause slaves were oen physicians. Sometimes physicians were generously </p>
<p>paid.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p> Luke shows his education by his use of good literary Koine style</p>
<p>88</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and his interest in detailed, comprehensive, orderly, truthful history in his </p>
<p>two writings sent to eophilus.</p>

<p>82. Josephus, Ant. 18.6.7 (203–4).</p>
<p>83. Acts 16:9–17; 20:5—21:18.</p>
<p>84. Acts 27:1—28:16. Barclay (1966: 251) suggests that, when traveling to Rome un-</p>
<p>der arrest, a prisoner was allowed to take two slaves with him as personal attendants. </p>
<p>Luke and Aristarchus were willing to accompany Paul in those circumstances. Most </p>
<p>likely, Luke completed the book of Acts during Paul’s earlier imprisonment. I think likely </p>
<p>that Luke researched his Gospel during Paul’s two-year imprisonment in Caesarea (Acts </p>
<p>23:31—26:32). See also Zahn 1953: 3:128. Paul quotes Luke’s Gospel in 1 Tim 5:18. Eu-</p>
<p>sebius relates that Luke was Antiochene by birth (Hist. eccl. 3.4). Some Latin texts have </p>
<p>“we” in Acts 11:27 (Zahn 1953: 3:2, 4–5, 51).</p>
<p>85. Phlm 24. Some early church fathers thought Paul referred to Luke’s Gospel in 2 </p>
<p>Cor 8:18 (e.g., Eusebius, Hist. eccl. 3.4; 5.8; 6.25; Zahn 1953: 3:6–7, 56).</p>
<p>86. Gal 4:13–15; 6:11; 2 Cor 12:7. Paul may have had ophthalmia (Reiter’s condition </p>
<p>or intermittent glaucoma). </p>
<p>87. E.g., a physician is paid twenty drachmas, the equivalent of twenty days work for </p>
<p>a laborer (BDAG, 465).</p>
<p>88. E.g., Robertson 1934: 50, 57–58, 86, 106–7, 121–23, 1064–65, 1084, 1106. </p>
<p>89. See prefaces. Luke was buried in Constantinople in AD 357 (Zahn 1953: 3:7; </p>
<p>Brownrigg 1971: 262). About Luke, Brownrigg summarizes: his character “emerges . . . as </p>
<p>that of a highly sensitive and sympathetic person of wide interests and perception” (260).</p>
