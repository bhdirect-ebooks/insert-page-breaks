<p>Teach What Is Consistent with Healthy Doctrine (2:1—3:11)</p>

<p>and indoors (Prov 31:13–27).</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>According to Xenophon, the landed Greek</p>
<p>wife is responsible to supervise and care for all the household workers, </p>
<p>manage the budget, oversee the making of clothes and the quality of the </p>
<p>raw food, teach spinning and housekeeping to the workers, and organize </p>
<p>storage of supplies.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>A Jewish wife was required to grind our, bake bread,</p>
<p>wash clothes, cook food, nurse their child, make ready the husband’s bed, </p>
<p>and work in wool unless she could aord household workers to help (m. </p>
<p>Ketub. 5:5). Moreover, women would oen participate in a joint business </p>
<p>with their husbands (e.g., Prisca and Aquila—tentmakers, Acts 18:3). e </p>
<p>women were rulers of the household (1 Tim 5:14) and thus could not be </p>
<p>idle (1 Tim 5:13). e rabbis agreed “idleness leads to unchastity” and </p>
<p>“idleness leads to lowness of spirit” (m. Ketub. 5:5). eir basis may be King </p>
<p>Lemuel’s mother, who said: the capable wife “does not eat the bread of idle-</p>
<p>ness” (Prov 31:27). </p>
<p>Early Christians, like Christians today, were concerned that God’s rev-</p>
<p>elation not be treated in a disrespectful way. Blaspheme (2:5) can be used </p>
<p>for disrespectful language about God (e.g., Rev 13:6) or about other human </p>
<p>beings.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>With respect to the young women being loving toward husband</p>
<p>and children, wise, pure, active, good, and respectful to husbands (Titus </p>
<p>2:5), Paul was trying to stem opposition to the faith.</p>
<p>Paul now nally claries what action Titus is to do: encourage: the </p>
<p>younger ones (probably males),</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>likewise, to be wise concerning all,</p>
<p>showing yourself a model of good works, in the teaching—pure, hon-</p>
<p>orable, beyond reproach, with a healthy message, in order that the op-</p>
<p>ponent might be ashamed, not having evil to say concerning us (2:6–8). </p>
<p>If the female elders are compared to the male elders by the use of likewise </p>
<p>(2:3), now the male youth are compared to the female youth (2:6). e </p>
<p>young men, like the young women, as well as the elders, are to be wise</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> </p>
<p>concerning all (2:7). Concerning all appears to summarize all the previ-</p>
<p>ous lists: young men, in every area of your life implement everything that </p>
<p>applies to you which I have already stated to the others. If the elder women </p>
<p>35. e Shulammite also is a vineyard keeper (Song 1:6) and, as well, Rachel was a </p>
<p>shepherd (Gen 29:9).</p>
<p>36. Oec. 7.33–41; 8.18–19; 9.6.</p>
<p>37. BDAG, 178. E.g., Acts 13:45; 18:6. See also 1 Tim 1:13 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>38. e masculine plural can also serve as the generic, but since younger women </p>
<p>were earlier mentioned (2:5), younger males are probably intended in 2:6.</p>
<p>39. 2:6, 2, 5; 1:8. See Titus 2:2.</p>
