<p>world.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>Now, he presents some specic illustrations of diculties Timothy</p>
<p>had learned about early in their acquaintance from Paul’s ministry at An-</p>
<p>tioch, Iconium, and Lystra. He picks three cities in the province of Galatia, </p>
<p>the governing center of Phrygia, Antioch in Pisidia, nearby Iconium, and </p>
<p>Timothy’s own home town, Lystra, in the region of Lycaonia.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>At rst at the synagogue in Antioch of Pisidia, the message of Paul </p>
<p>and Barnabas was enthusiastically received. But some Jews, lled with </p>
<p>jealousy at the large crowds, slandered them and contradicted their words, </p>
<p>eventually stirring up so much persecution against them they had to leave </p>
<p>the region.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>At Iconium, also at rst in the synagogue, many believed. But</p>
<p>again the unbelieving Jews stirred up persecution against them and tried </p>
<p>to stone them (Acts 14:1–5). us, Paul and Barnabas arrived in Lystra </p>
<p>just having been persecuted extensively for their faith. At Lystra, Paul and </p>
<p>Barnabas were again well received aer they healed a crippled man. How-</p>
<p>ever, Jews from the earlier cities followed Paul and Barnabas to Lystra (Acts </p>
<p>14:8–19). ey persuaded the crowds to stone Paul and dragged him out of </p>
<p>the city, thinking he was dead. When Paul returned to Lystra, what did he </p>
<p>emphasize in his teaching? “It is through many persecutions that we must </p>
<p>enter the kingdom of God” (Acts 14:22). Paul reminds Timothy of this very </p>
<p>message: what persecutions I endured (3:11). And yet the Lord rescued </p>
<p>him from them all. Even in Lystra, he got up and traveled by foot the next </p>
<p>day (Acts 14:20).</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From these illustrations, Paul concludes: Likewise</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> all the ones wish-</p>
<p>ing in a godly manner to live in Christ Jesus will be persecuted (3:12). </p>
<p>Being an apostle, Paul is not in a unique position when it comes to suer-</p>
<p>ing: All . . . will be persecuted.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>Why? ey will be persecuted because</p>
<p>they desire to live in Christ Jesus in a godly manner (eusebōs). In a world </p>
<p>that is not genuinely godly, not dedicating itself to please God in its words </p>
<p>and actions,</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>godly living can become an indirect judgment, and those</p>

<p>64. Ramsay 2001: 95–96, 99–101; Hansen 1994: 378–79.</p>
<p>65. Acts 13:14–50. It is probable that the persecution in Antioch and hinted at in </p>
<p>Lystra included beating by lictors according to Ramsay (2001: 97–98).</p>
<p>66. See 1 Tim 4:12 (Spencer 2013). David also describes the Lord as rescuing the </p>
<p>righteous from all their aictions (Ps 33:19; LXX) (Fee 1988: 277).</p>
<p>67. De kai together signify heightened emphasis: “but also” (BDAG, 213).</p>
