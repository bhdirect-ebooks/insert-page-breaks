<p>2 Timothy 2112</p>
<p>own use of it for an honorable or dishonorable purpose, sexual holiness or </p>
<p>impurity (vv. 4–7). us, the reference to eeing youthful passions (2:22) </p>
<p>follows naturally from the earlier reference to vessels.</p>
<p>Timothy, and others in the church, can make themselves into ves-</p>
<p>sels for honorable uses. is result is dependent on the condition: if some </p>
<p>might purify themselves from these things (2:21). These things appears </p>
<p>to refer to all the negative behavior previously mentioned: disputing about </p>
<p>words that are useless and destructive, engaging in godless empty talk, </p>
<p>and unrighteousness (2:14–19). But, he will also apply unrighteousness to </p>
<p>youthful passions and foolish and non-instructive arguments (2:22–23). </p>
<p>e subjunctive tense (might purify) indicates that purication is a pos-</p>
<p>sible but not an accomplished goal. A vessel of honor is further dened in </p>
<p>three ways: (1) consecrated, (2) useful to the master, and (3) prepared </p>
<p>for every good work (2:21). e vessel is consecrated or made holy. In 1 </p>
<p>Timothy, Paul described everything created by God, including marriage </p>
<p>and all foods, as “rendered holy” or “sanctied” (hagiazō) by God’s word </p>
<p>and prayer.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>As Jesus prayed, believers are sent into the world but they are</p>
<p>not from the world (John 17:14–19). ey too are to work on being holy de </p>
<p>facto in an unholy world.</p>
<p>An honorable vessel, like a household servant, is available for service </p>
<p>by the master of the household, by implication, the Lord (2:19). is vessel </p>
<p>has been prepared ready for use for every good work (2:21). Every good </p>
<p>work has a double meaning, literally, for its intended use in the household, </p>
<p>and, metaphorically, for holy or good behavior.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p> </p>
<p>101. See 1 Tim 4:5 (Spencer 2013). In the OT, hagiazō refers to something or someone </p>
<p>set apart for God. For example, the rst born son is set apart for God (Exod 13:2). Priests </p>
<p>must undergo a lengthy process of oerings, washing, putting on special garments, be-</p>
<p>ing anointed with oil, and sprinkled with blood in order to be able to minister in the </p>
<p>sanctuary (Exod 19:22–23; 28:37; 29:1–46). at lengthy process has been superseded </p>
<p>by Jesus’ perfect oering (Heb 9:13–14; 10:10, 14, 29: 13:12) so that now faith in Christ </p>
<p>Jesus sancties (Acts 26:18; 1 Cor 1:2; 6:11.) Nevertheless, each believer now works to </p>
<p>make actual in their own lives and in other lives what Christ has accomplished in God’s </p>
<p>sight (e.g., Eph 5:26–27).</p>
<p>102. Also 3:17. If a vessel for honor has clearly positive connotations, then a vessel for </p>
<p>dishonor would have negative connotations. Dishonor appears to refer to the negative </p>
<p>behavior Timothy is to avoid. But, could the dierence in 2:20–21 between a vessel of </p>
<p>honor and a vessel of dishonor simply refer to “special/valued” vs. “ordinary/everyday/</p>
<p>cheap” use (NRSV, NLT, REB), instead of “noble/honour” vs. “ignoble/dishonour” (NIV, </p>
<p>KJV, NTME) (2:20–21)? Probably not, in this case, because “noble” vs. “ignoble” ts bet-</p>
<p>ter in the context. In Rom 9:21–22, similar terminology of “dishonor” refers to objects </p>
<p>made for destruction, while in 1 Cor 12:23 the opposite of “honor” is not “dishonor,” but </p>
<p>what “we think” has less honor. </p>
