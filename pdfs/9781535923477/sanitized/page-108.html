<p>2 TIMOTHY 2</p>
<p>Keep Empowered and Entrust Paul’s Teachings (2:1–2)</p>
<p>Paul, having mentioned his attitude to his imprisonment, the power of Je-</p>
<p>sus (1:12), the soundness and importance of Paul’s own words (1:12–13), </p>
<p>the receptiveness of Timothy (1:13), the presence of the Holy Spirit (1:14), </p>
<p>the negative example of some believers (1:15), and the positive example </p>
<p>of others (1:16–18), returns again to exhort Timothy: erefore, you, my </p>
<p>child, keep on being empowered in the grace, the one in Christ Jesus, </p>
<p>and what you heard from me through many witnesses, entrust these </p>
<p>things to trustworthy humans, who are able also to teach others (2:1–2). </p>
<p>Paul has given many reasons how and why Timothy can continue to be </p>
<p>empowered. By using the pronoun you, Paul exhorts Timothy in particular </p>
<p>to be like Onesiphorus’ household and not like Phygelus and Hermogenes. </p>
<p>He calls Timothy again my child to remind him of their special spiritual </p>
<p>parent-child relationship.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> Timothy’s power</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>comes from Jesus to guard the</p>
<p>message entrusted to him (1:12). Somehow, Timothy himself should make </p>
<p>an eort, but yet that eort is done in Christ Jesus’ grace (2:1).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Christ’s</p>
<p>grace has already accomplished many marvelous actions.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Yet, Timothy</p>
<p>himself needs to participate in an ongoing process to allow Christ Jesus’ </p>
<p>strength to come into his life.</p>
<p>Timothy has to guard his own walk with Jesus and develop an army </p>
<p>with which to ght. As Paul realizes his own death is imminent, he wants </p>
<p>to strengthen Timothy and strengthen the church, thus Paul begins 2:2 de-</p>
<p>scribing what it is that Timothy needs to entrust to others: what you heard </p>
<p>from me through many witnesses. e content of the education is of para-</p>
<p>mount importance. is content is validated by two sources: (1) me (i.e., </p>
<p>Paul) and (2) many witnesses. Timothy directly heard from Paul about Jesus </p>
<p>being the Christ and the Savior, having abolished death and having brought </p>
<p>1. See 1 Tim 1:2 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>2. Even when Paul was deserted by humans, he still could be strengthened by the </p>
<p>Lord (4:17). See also Rom 4:16–21; Phil 4:12–13.</p>
<p>3. See also 2 Tim 1:8, 12, 14. </p>
<p>4. See 2 Tim 2:9–10.</p>
