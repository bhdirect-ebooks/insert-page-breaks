<p>Avoid Ungodly Talking, BecomeaVesselforGoodWorks(2:14–26)</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>Godless empty talk has two basic results: (1) they will increase to </p>
<p>more ungodliness and (2) their word as a spreading gangrene will in-</p>
<p>crease (2:16–17). Ungodliness is the negation of worship (sebeia). Godless </p>
<p>empty talk is not static, it increases. Its ramications increase, while genu-</p>
<p>ine worship decreases.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>Paul then repeats the same concept using a simile:</p>
<p>as a spreading gangrene (2:17). Gaggraina is “a disease involving severe </p>
<p>inammation, which if le unchecked can become a destructive ulcerous </p>
<p>condition, gangrene, cancer.”</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>is illness is spreading and is destructive</p>
<p>(nomē).</p>
<p>88</p>
<p> Not all growth is healthy.</p>
<p>Gangrene is gradual and painful. It is massive death of tissue, an </p>
<p>infection that may be caused by overly tight bandaging or the growth of </p>
<p>bacteria that live without oxygen but enter the body through a wound. e </p>
<p>bacteria produce a toxin that spreads into the surrounding tissues and kills </p>
<p>them. e cure is removal of the dead tissues.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>What does gangrene have</p>
<p>in common with godless empty talk (2:16)? An outside source causes spir-</p>
<p>itual death and unhealthy growth, spreads, and eventually results in people </p>
<p>losing, not gaining, their salvation (2:19). Paul then gives an example of </p>
<p>two people: among whom are both</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>Hymenaeus and Philetus, who,</p>
<p>concerning the truth, have deviated, saying, the resurrection already </p>
<p>is past, and they are upsetting the faith of some (2:17–18). Hymenaeus </p>
<p>(mentioned in 1 Tim 1:20) apparently has won over a coworker, Philetus. </p>
<p>Along with Alexander, Hymenaeus had abandoned the conscience, the in-</p>
<p>terior faculty for the personal discernment of good and evil, as guided by </p>
<p>faith or trust in God for an external law structure.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>Both Hymenaeus and</p>
<p>Alexander had been acting in a diabolical manner: deceiving and speaking </p>
<p>falsely instead of furthering truth, peace, righteousness, and love. </p>
<p>Wrong teaching about the resurrection (anastasis) has been men-</p>
<p>tioned elsewhere in the New Testament. Some Greeks might not want to </p>
<p>believe in a bodily resurrection because the body or matter was considered </p>
<p>86. See Titus 2:12; 1 Tim 4:15 (Spencer 2013). Asebeia (“ungodliness”) is a synonym </p>
<p>of bebēlos (godless; 2:16). Paul had previously exhorted Timothy to progress in his spiri-</p>
<p>tual life, but in 2 Tim he describes a negative progression, of ungodliness and deception </p>
<p>(2:16; 3:13).</p>
