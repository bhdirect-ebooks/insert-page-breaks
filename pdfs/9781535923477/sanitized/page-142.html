<p>2 Timothy 3128</p>
<p>Timothy had a two part process: he learned and then he was rmly </p>
<p>persuaded (3:14). Over an extended period of time Timothy learned.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Manthanō may refer to the acquisition of knowledge or skill gained by </p>
<p>instruction and, as well, to the thoughtful pondering for further under-</p>
<p>standing of the signicance of something or someone.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>Both aspects are</p>
<p>pertinent here. e content of the learning is the holy writings. Timothy’s </p>
<p>learning contrasts with the learning of some women in the church, who </p>
<p>never arrive at the “knowledge of truth” (3:7 vs. 1 Tim 2:4). Timothy has </p>
<p>come to the knowledge of truth because he is now rmly persuaded. </p>
<p>Pistoō</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>is a signicant concept in the Old Testament. It can refer to God</p>
<p>establishing or conrming a truth or a promise</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>or to humans conrming</p>
<p>a truth.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p> Faithfulness is included.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>us, Paul has observed that Timothy</p>
<p>has moved from learning to commitment, conrming the truth of what he </p>
<p>was taught by word and action.</p>
<p>Timothy’s acquaintance with and regard for his teachers, which in-</p>
<p>clude Paul and many others, helps him persist.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>His teachers included Lois</p>
<p>and Eunice, who taught Timothy from infancy (3:15).</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>Lois and Eunice</p>
<p>taught this man (Timothy) and were armed in it, and, now, Timothy is </p>
<p>commanded to remember them. Infancy (brephos) can refer to a fetus still </p>
<p>in the womb</p>
<p>83</p>
<p> or to a newborn child or nursing baby.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>Timothy’s mother</p>
<p>Eunice and grandmother Lois began to teach Timothy at the earliest age </p>
<p>possible!</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>Apparently, they did not even wait for ve years of age (m. Abot’</p>
<p>5:21). e content of their education was the holy writings or Scriptures </p>
<p>(3:15). A pious Jew of that time would consider the holy writings to refer to </p>
<p>75. Remain is in the present imperative showing an ongoing process. Learning and </p>
<p>being rmly persuaded are in the aorist tense. Paul treats each of the two actions as a </p>
<p>single whole, with emphasis on the completion of the actions (Robertson 1934: 832, 835).</p>
<p>76. See 1 Tim 2:11 (Spencer 2013).</p>
<p>77. Pistoō is related to pistos (“faithful”) and pisteuō (“to trust or believe”). E.g., 1Tim </p>
<p>1:16; Titus 3:8.</p>
<p>78. E.g., 2 Sam 7:16; 1 Kings 1:36; 8:26, LXX.</p>
<p>79. E.g., 1 Chr 17:24; 2 Chr 1:9; Ps 77:8, 37, LXX.</p>
<p>80. Sir 27:17; 29:3.</p>
<p>81. See 2 Tim 2:2.</p>
<p>82. Manthanō in 2 Tim 3:14 is the same verb used in 1 Tim 2:11.</p>
<p>83. Luke 1:41, 44; Sir 19:11.</p>
<p>84. Luke 2:12, 16; 1 Pet 2:2; 3 Macc 5:49.</p>
<p>85. See 2 Tim 1:5.</p>
