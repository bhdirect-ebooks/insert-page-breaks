<p>Titus 110</p>
<p>47:4). Caphtor is a Hebrew name for Crete. Caphtorites and Kerethites were </p>
<p>names used for descendants from Crete. </p>
<p>us, we cannot be sure when the Christian community began in </p>
<p>Crete, but, most likely some Jews returned to it from Jerusalem aer Pen-</p>
<p>tecost to live as disciples of the Messiah Jesus. However, the church needed </p>
<p>better organization, doctrine, and moral standards.</p>
<p>Paul regularly works with a team of coworkers, picking them up as </p>
<p>he comes to their city, and leaving them behind to handle specic prob-</p>
<p>lems.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Paul now describes the twofold purpose of Titus’ ministry: (1) that</p>
<p>you yourself might set straight further the things remaining; (2) and </p>
<p>you might set up in each city elders, as I myself directed to you (1:5). </p>
<p>Epidiorthoō (set straight), like orthotomeō (“to cut straight”; 2 Tim 2:15) </p>
<p>is built on the root orthos (“straight”). Even as the physically crippled man </p>
<p>Paul healed at Lystra was able to stand straight (Acts 14:10), those spiritual-</p>
<p>ly “crippled” need to “stand” straight (Heb 12:12–13). Diorthōsis (“making </p>
<p>straight”) could refer to restoring a broken or misshapen limb.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>us, the</p>
<p>implication is that some restoring or making straight had been done when </p>
<p>Paul was in Crete, but it had not been completed, and that Titus himself </p>
<p>had to make the eort to nish it. One way to set straight is by appointing </p>
<p>elders. However, the church at Crete had more than leadership that was </p>
<p>not “straight.” It also had ungodliness and worldly passion (2:11), includ-</p>
<p>ing dissipation, pleasing only oneself, quick tempers, bullying, shameful </p>
<p>gain, empty and deceptive talk, turning to lies from the truth, corruption, </p>
unfaithfulness, disobedience, slander, quarreling about the law, and divi-
<p>siveness. e elders could help, but ultimately every believer had to decide </p>
<p>if he or she wanted to walk straight. And, while Titus was there, he had to </p>
<p>encourage good choices by his teaching and exhortation (2:15; 3:14).</p>
<p>What did the elders do (1:5)? eir function is only suggested in the </p>
<p>letter. eir role had similarities to Titus’. e same verb (set up; kathistēmi) </p>
<p>is used elsewhere in the New Testament of those placed in charge of small </p>
<p>or large households, such as a slave or manager who feeds and oversees the </p>
<p>other workers and makes investments,</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> judges over disputers,</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>exemplied</p>
<p>13. For example, in Paul’s second missionary journey, Timothy joins Paul and Silas </p>
<p>at Lystra (Acts 16:1–5), Luke joins them at Troas (Acts 16:8–10), then Luke stays behind </p>
<p>to minister in Philippi (Acts 16:12–17; 20:5–6), while Timothy and Silas stay behind to </p>
<p>minister in Beroea (Acts 17:14–16; 18:5).</p>
