<p>Jesus’ Self-Revelation as the Life-Giving Bread</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>blood symbolize the response of human beings for Jesus’ giving himself on </p>
<p>the cross in terms of coming to him to satisfy their hunger and believing in </p>
<p>him to quench their thirst (cf. 6:35). ey signify “the believing appropria-</p>
<p>tion—by the mouth of faith—of Jesus’ self-oering in death.”</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>ough the</p>
<p>terms cannot be interpreted in terms of eating and drinking in the Eucha-</p>
<p>rist, Christians in the late rst century possibly understood the signicance </p>
<p>of the Eucharist by reading 6:53–58.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>e title “the Son of Man” is mainly used to denote Jesus’ glorication </p>
<p>on the cross (cf. 3:14; 8:28; 12:23, 32–34), and in 6:53 also it indicates Jesus’ </p>
<p>self-sacrice on the cross, which leads those who eat his esh and drink </p>
<p>his blood to partake in his life. e present tense “has eternal life” and the </p>
<p>future “I will raise him up at the last day” are put together in 6:54 to convey </p>
<p>the idea that believing in Jesus as the bread of life leads the believer to pos-</p>
<p>sess eternal life now (6:47; 3:36; 5:24) and to participate in the future life of </p>
<p>resurrection even aer physical death (cf. 5:29). e adverb “truly” (6:55) </p>
<p>shows that Jesus’ esh as food and blood as drink are authentic, since they </p>
<p>belong to the heavenly sphere.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ose who absorb the life of the Son of Man by faith abide in him and </p>
<p>he in them in the sense that they mutually dwell within one another (6:56). </p>
<p>is means that the believers absorb Jesus’ life by being knit together with </p>
<p>him by faith and bear fruit for the glory of the Father (15:1–11). Both the </p>
<p>Father and the Son are in one another (14:10–11) and so the one who is </p>
<p>united with Jesus actually abides in the Father through Jesus.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> us, mu-</p>
<p>tual union with Jesus enables one to receive God’s life even now (cf. the </p>
<p>present tense “abides”). is union becomes possible by the Holy Spirit, an </p>
<p>idea implied in 6:56 (cf. 6:63). e interrelation between believers, Jesus, </p>
<p>and God through the Spirit is a life-sharing relationship (6:57) without the </p>
<p>notion of deication. ose who come into union with Jesus will live be-</p>
<p>cause of him, as the Son lives by sharing in the Father’s life (5:21, 26). </p>
<p>In 6:58 Jesus sums up his discourse by referring back to the people’s </p>
<p>indirect question in 6:31. He reveals himself again as the bread that came </p>
<p>down from heaven so that those who eat of it may live forever even aer </p>
<p>sacraments; Blomberg 2001: 126–27.</p>
