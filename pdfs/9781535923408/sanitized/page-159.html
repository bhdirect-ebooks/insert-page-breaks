<p>John 12:37–50</p>

<p>believe in him, and others, by hardening their hearts, do not believe. Such a </p>
<p>double response is inevitable whenever God’s words are preached and signs </p>
<p>performed.</p>
<p>Isaiah uttered such words because he saw his glory and spoke of him </p>
<p>(John 12:41; cf. Acts 2:31). “His glory” indicates Jesus’ glory (cf. 12:37, 42). </p>
<p>Obviously, 12:41 looks back to Isaiah’s vision in the temple (Isa 6:1–7) and </p>
<p>reinterprets the “glory of Yahweh” (Tg. Isa. 6:1) as the glory of Jesus. Isaiah, </p>
<p>who ministered in the eighth/seventh century BCE, saw the pre-existent </p>
<p>Christ who was with God (1:1; 5:46; 8:56, 58) and proclaimed him. In this </p>
<p>context, the citation from Isa 6:9–10 in John 12:40 proves that although </p>
<p>Jesus, who was foreseen by Isaiah and who existed before Abraham, per-</p>
<p>formed several signs, many did not believe in him. Nevertheless, many, </p>
<p>even of the Jewish authorities, believed in Jesus, although they were not </p>
<p>bold enough to publicly confess their faith, because they feared that the </p>
<p>Pharisees would put them out of the synagogue (12:42; cf. 9:22). ose who </p>
<p>feared excommunication treated it as humiliation rather than an opportu-</p>
<p>nity to bear witness to Jesus. ey loved to have reputation from human </p>
<p>beings rather than the praise from God (12:43).</p>
<p>Jesus “cried out”—a verb used to indicate Jesus’ identity or origin or </p>
<p>his gi to humans (cf. 1:15; 7:28, 37; 12:44)—that he is the reection of the </p>
<p>Father who sent him, because they are one (10:30, 38; 14:10–11). erefore </p>
<p>those who believe in him believe in God and those who see Jesus can see </p>
<p>God, who sent him into the world (12:44–45). e Jewish shaliah principle </p>
<p>says that an agent represents the one who sends him (m. Ber. 5:5). is </p>
<p>principle does not imply that Jesus is an emissary of the Father.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Jesus’</p>
<p>statements show that the Son manifests God, the Sender, not as his emis-</p>
<p>sary, but as the one who pre-existed with him and as the one who shares </p>
<p>equality with him.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Jesus’ reminder, “I have come as light into the world”</p>
<p>(12:46a), recalls the coming of the Logos-Light into the world and of the </p>
<p>need to believe in him (1:9–12; 8:12; 9:5). He came to free those who be-</p>
<p>lieve in Jesus from their attachment with darkness, the realm of evil that </p>
<p>leads to nal condemnation (12:46b; 35–36; 3:18–19).</p>
<p>“Believing” involves hearing Jesus’ words and obeying them. Reject-</p>
<p>ing Jesus means not believing in him and hence not receiving his sayings. </p>
<p>Jesus warns those who disobey his sayings now that they will be judged on </p>
<p>the last day by the same word spoken by him, although he himself did not </p>
