<p>John 19:31–37</p>
<p>191</p>
<p>Jesus’ life, particularly his suering and death, took place in human </p>
<p>history in fulllment of God’s will written in Scripture (19:24, 28, 36, 37). </p>
<p>John summarizes the passion story by citing two OT prophecies that Jesus </p>
<p>fullled. “ese things,” which includes the suering and death of Jesus </p>
<p>before his legs were broken, happened to fulll the scripture, “Not a bone </p>
<p>of him shall be broken” (19:36). e quotation alludes to Ps 34:20, which </p>
<p>mentions that not one of the righteous person’s bones will be broken. is </p>
<p>proves that Jesus suered and died as a righteous man. Jesus’ death echoes, </p>
<p>more than anything, the Passover statute according to which the Passover </p>
<p>lamb should be eaten without breaking any of its bones and without leaving </p>
<p>any part of it until the morning (Exod 12:46; Num 9:12). If Jesus was killed </p>
<p>as a paschal lamb, then lawfully his legs were not to be broken and his body </p>
<p>should be removed before the next day, the “high day,” that is, Sabbath.</p>
<p>e crucied Jesus fullled “another scripture,” Zech 12:10, which </p>
<p>predicts that when the Lord pours upon Judeans a spirit of grace and pleas </p>
<p>for mercy, they shall look on him whom they have pierced. Jesus fullled </p>
<p>the role of Yahweh who will be pierced by the evil deeds of Jewish nation, </p>
<p>but on whom the nation will look with mourning for their evil (19:37). </p>
<p>Since a Roman soldier pierced Jesus’ side on behalf of “the Jews,” it is they </p>
<p>who pierced him. e prophecy “they shall look on him” predicts that those </p>
<p>who pierced Jesus would come to know through the witness of the church </p>
<p>that Jesus is the Messiah who came to deliver them from their wickedness </p>
<p>(cf. 8:28). “Piercing” symbolizes the opening of the fountain on the cross to </p>
<p>cleanse people of their sin (cf. Zech 13:1) and give them heavenly life (cf. </p>
<p>3:14–15; 7:37–38).</p>
<p>Jesus’ Burial (19:38–42) </p>
<p>As per the Roman custom, the bodies of executed criminals were le to </p>
<p>be devoured by vultures without burial. However, the Jews used to bury </p>
<p>criminals’ bodies in a common grave provided by the Sanhedrin (m. Sanh. </p>
<p>6:5).</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>In John, however, Jesus was buried as a king. Aer he died, Joseph</p>
<p>of Arimathea, a secret disciple of Jesus for fear of “the Jews,” asked Pilate to </p>
<p>hand over Jesus’ body to him. With Pilate’s permission, he came to the place </p>
<p>of crucixion and took away Jesus’ body (19:38). Joseph of Arimathea, </p>
<p>mentioned in all four Gospels, was from a Jewish town called Arimathea </p>
<p>(Luke 23:50), which was in the northwestern part of Judea at its border </p>
<p>30. Kruse 2008: 367.</p>
