<p>Jesus’ Injunction on His Disciples’ Mission</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>e woman’s encounter with Christ gave her courage to invite others </p>
<p>to come to Jesus. In Greek her question, “Can this be the Christ?,” begins </p>
<p>with a negative particle mēti, expecting the answer “no.” However, this par-</p>
<p>ticle, in 4:29, “puts a suggestion in the most tentative and hesitating way.”</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before she believes in Jesus fully along with other Samaritans (4:42), she </p>
<p>wanted them to ensure whether Jesus could be the long-awaited Christ. e </p>
<p>fact that many of them came to believe in Jesus through the woman’s word </p>
<p>of testimony (4:39) shows that her faith in Jesus was genuine.</p>
<p>While the Samaritans were coming to Jesus (4:30), the disciples were </p>
<p>persuading him to eat the food they had brought (4:31). Just like Jesus did </p>
<p>not drink the earthly water from the woman, so also he did not eat the </p>
<p>earthly food. In conformity with the non-understanding of Nicodemus and </p>
<p>of the Samaritan, his disciples too did not understand the spiritual truth in </p>
<p>Jesus’ statement, “I have food to eat of which you do not know” (4:32). ey </p>
<p>understood it at the human level and therefore questioned among them-</p>
<p>selves, “Did anyone bring him food to eat?” (4:33). John’s literary pattern </p>
<p>where Jesus makes a statement, which is misunderstood, prompting him to </p>
<p>speak further for clarication, becomes visible again.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Jesus now claries</p>
<p>by saying, “My food is that I may do the will of him who sent me and may </p>
<p>accomplish his work” (4:34). His source of life was in the accomplishment </p>
<p>of the Father’s work.</p>
<p>e sending of the Son by the Father into the world is a familiar theme </p>
<p>in John. e Father sent his Son (cf. 3:17, 34; 6:38; 7:18; 9:4). at is, the </p>
<p>Son was sent from heaven (6:38) to save the world. However, John par-</p>
<p>ticularizes Jesus’ suering and death on the cross as the means by which </p>
<p>he accomplished the work of the Father (cf. 5:36; 17:4; 19:28, 30). Just like </p>
<p>food nourishes all living beings, so also accomplishing his Father’s plan of </p>
<p>salvation gives nourishment to Jesus (cf. Deut 8:3). </p>
<p>Jesus now unveils to his disciples the present possibility for them to </p>
<p>fulll God’s mission of bringing many into God’s new society (4:35; cf. </p>
<p>20:21). He does this by reminding them of a common saying that there are </p>
<p>yet four months for the harvest to come (4:35a).</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Normally it took four</p>
<p>months from the end of sowing to the beginning of harvest.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>However, in</p>

<p>17. e question in the form “Do you not say . . . ?” expects the answer “yes.” e term </p>
<p>“you” denotes generally the society to which his disciples belong.</p>
