<p>Jesus, the Self-Giving Shepherd</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>“I came” in 10:10 is a missiological term that denotes Jesus’ mission in </p>
<p>the world to give heavenly life in abundance to those who become his sheep </p>
<p>by receiving him. In contrast, the “thief ” comes to steal the faith of Jesus’ </p>
<p>sheep, to kill and to lead humanity to nal destruction. e singular “the </p>
<p>thief ” is a collective term that denotes Jesus’ opponents, whose purpose is </p>
<p>to snatch away those who confess Jesus as the Christ from him and from </p>
<p>the synagogue fellowship (9:22, 34). eir murderous act and the (10:12) </p>
<p>are stressed in the purpose clause with a double negative in Greek (10:10). </p>
<p>eir purpose is in contrast to Jesus’ purpose of coming into the world to </p>
<p>give his life as a sacrice to remove human sin, fullling thus the temple </p>
<p>sacrice of sheep.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>erefore Jesus claims himself as the good shepherd by</p>
<p>using God’s self-revelatory name “I am” (10:11). It shows himself as the </p>
<p>shepherd in the line of David, the Davidic Messiah (2 Sam 5:2; Ps 78:70–72; </p>
<p>Jer 3:15; Ezek 34:23–24; 37:24; Mic 5:2, 4; cf. Pss. Sol. 17:40–42), who will </p>
<p>sacrice his life for the welfare of others (Isa 53:12; Zech 12:10; 13:7–9).</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jesus is “good” because he is the model of what a shepherd should </p>
<p>be.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> erefore we may call him the “noble shepherd.”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Jesus again contrasts</p>
<p>himself with the false religious leaders, who are guratively and collectively </p>
<p>called a “hireling.” Like a hireling, they forsake Jesus’ sheep to be snatched </p>
<p>and scattered by “the wolf” and ee to save their own life (10:12–13; cf. </p>
<p>Ezek 22:27). “e wolf,” in a church context, implies collectively the false </p>
<p>apostles and teachers (Acts 20:29–30). In the OT, Yahweh is portrayed as </p>
<p>the caring shepherd over against the shepherds of Israel who were destroy-</p>
<p>ing and scattering the sheep of his pasture (Jer 23:1–4; Ezek 34:11–16). In </p>
<p>John, Jesus takes up the role of Yahweh to be a loving shepherd and to have </p>
<p>intimate relationship with his sheep, because what belonged to God are </p>
<p>now “his own” sheep (10:14; cf. 6:37, 39–40). Jesus knows his sheep as the </p>
<p>ones who were given to him by God in order to communicate God’s words </p>
<p>to them, to consecrate them in truth and to keep them one (17:6–19). e </p>
<p>4. e idea of sacrice is known from the phrase “laying down his life for the sheep” </p>
<p>(John 10:11; cf. Zech 13:7–9; Isa 53:10) and by the Greek term thyein, “to kill” (10:10), </p>
<p>which anticipates “the Jews” who would kill Jesus.</p>

<p>ses’ prayer for a good shepherd (Agr. 10.44; cf. Agr. 12.49) and ascribes shepherding, in </p>
<p>the context of God’s “I Am” statement, to God and his rstborn Son, the true Word (Agr. </p>
<p>12.50–52).</p>
