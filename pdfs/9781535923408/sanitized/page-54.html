<p>Jesus’ Public Ministry</p>

<p>animal sacrice is at hand.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>In this act of Jesus, one can see the shadow of</p>
<p>the cross again.</p>
<p>is is conrmed in 2:20–22. e temple authorities misunderstood </p>
<p>Jesus’ statement that he was boasting himself of rebuilding the destroyed </p>
<p>temple in three days, while it took originally forty-six years to build </p>
<p>(2:19–20).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> ey ridiculed him for saying so (cf. Matt 27:40) without un-</p>
<p>derstanding that Jesus would give up his body to be destroyed on the cross </p>
<p>and would raise it up in three days (2:21) to restore true spiritual worship </p>
<p>for which the Jerusalem temple stood. Even his disciples only understood </p>
<p>this aer Jesus’ resurrection. John displays his literary device of non-under-</p>
<p>standing to lead his readers to a higher level of understanding.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>e resurrection of Jesus opened the eyes of Jesus’ community to see </p>
<p>the reality behind his signs and symbolic acts. e comment “his disciples </p>
<p>remembered” (2:17, 22) means an unveiling of truth by the Spirit aer the </p>
<p>death and resurrection of Jesus (14:26; 16:14) so that they might believe the </p>
<p>Scripture that testies to Jesus (cf. 1:45; 5:39). Such a new vision of Jesus is </p>
<p>a partial fulllment of “greater things” to be seen by his disciples (1:50–51).</p>
<p>Supernatural knowledge of Jesus (2:23–25)</p>
<p>Jesus was participating in the Passover feast (2:23a). John does not describe </p>
<p>how the Passover was celebrated in the temple; his focus is always on Jesus </p>
<p>and his deeds and on people’s response to him. Many believed in Jesus’ </p>
<p>name by looking at the signs he performed (2:23b). e plural “signs” in-</p>
<p>forms us that Jesus could have done other signs besides what is narrated in </p>
<p>John 2. ese could include his healing of many blind and lame people who </p>
<p>came to him when he was in the temple (cf. Matt 21:14). ough many be-</p>
<p>lieved in Jesus, they did so because they saw signs. is kind of supercial </p>
<p>faith springs up from common human nature. ose who saw Jesus’ signs </p>
<p>were amazed and appreciated him probably as a wonder-worker without </p>
<p>making a faith commitment to him.</p>

<p>16. Neither the temple repaired by Herod the Great nor the second temple, built </p>
<p>under the leadership of Zerubbabel, took forty-six years to construct. It is probable that </p>
<p>the specication of forty-six years includes the whole period of Persian kings, Cyrus and </p>
<p>Darius (559–513 BCE), in whose time the second temple was built; see Kanagaraj 2005: </p>
<p>110, 113 n. 34.</p>
