<p>Jesus’ Prayer for His Disciples</p>
<p>168</p>
<p>Jesus has sought the fullness of his joy to be within his disciples (15:11; </p>
<p>16:24) by speaking “these things” in the world (17:13b). “ese things” </p>
<p>does not refer to what he speaks in his prayer alone, but to Jesus’ message in </p>
<p>toto given to his disciples thus far.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jesus relates both God’s word given to his disciples and the world’s </p>
<p>hatred of them (17:14). e total message of Jesus is from God and the </p>
<p>disciples have received them and believed in Jesus as the one sent by God </p>
<p>(17:8). Consequently, their lifestyle is dierent from the worldly standard </p>
<p>of life that is dominated by the evil one and thus they do not belong to the </p>
<p>world, as Jesus is not of this world. erefore the world has hated them. Je-</p>
<p>sus makes this point in his prayer not with the desire that the Father should </p>
<p>take them out of the world, but that he should protect them from the evil </p>
<p>one (17:15; cf. 17:11–12). e “evil” mentioned is the personication of </p>
<p>cosmic evil, known as “the ruler of this world” (12:31; 14:30; 16:11).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>He</p>
<p>has been tempting Jesus’ adherents to follow the selsh nature of the world. </p>
<p>ere is a danger for Jesus’ followers to fall as a prey to him and perish (e.g., </p>
<p>6:70; 13:2, 27). erefore, Jesus prays the Father to protect them from this </p>
<p>evil one.</p>
<p>Keeping oneself away from evil leads to “sanctication” or “holiness,” </p>
<p>which denotes God’s character of moral purity and a life separated from </p>
<p>the world (Lev 11:44–45). God’s word, communicated through Jesus, is </p>
<p>the heavenly truth that has power to sanctify the disciples. erefore Jesus </p>
<p>prays, “Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth” (17:17). e dis-</p>
<p>ciples’ consecration is inseparable from their mission to the world, for aer </p>
<p>beseeching the Father to sanctify his followers, Jesus states, “As you sent </p>
<p>me into the world, I also sent them into the world” (17:18). Sanctifying </p>
<p>believers is God’s work and doing God’s mission is the work of the church </p>
<p>sent by Jesus. </p>
<p>Jesus declares, “And I consecrate myself for them so that they also may </p>
<p>be consecrated in truth” (17:19). e phrase “for them,” in John, conveys </p>
<p>the idea of dying for the welfare of others (10:11, 15, 17–18; 11:51; 15:13), </p>
<p>echoing the Lord’s Servant who poured out his soul to death bearing the sin </p>
<p>of many (Isa 53:10, 12). Jesus’ self-consecration involves oering himself </p>
<p>for taking away human sin (cf. Isa 53:4–10). Jesus consecrates himself for </p>
<p>the benet of his disciples so that they also may be consecrated by the word </p>
<p>of truth in Jesus (17:17; cf. 10:36).</p>
