<p>Jesus, the Light of the World</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>these lights were extinguished, and Jesus declared, “I am the Light of the </p>
<p>world” (8:12a), meaning that this Light shines in the darkness (1:5) and </p>
<p>replaces the ritual lights. e feast of Tabernacles commemorated God’s </p>
<p>presence in the pillar of re and cloud that saved the Israelites from their </p>
<p>enemies and led them in the wilderness (Exod 13:21–22; 14:19–25; 40:38). </p>
<p>Similarly, Jesus, the Light of the world, reveals God in his dazzling light and </p>
<p>saves from danger all those who follow him.</p>
<p>Each “I am” saying with a predicate in John demands some form of </p>
<p>human response: Just like Jesus as the bread of life is to be “eaten,” as the </p>
<p>Light he is to be followed (8:12b). e verb “to follow” in Judaism, means </p>
<p>“leading an ethical life in accordance with the Law.” In Jesus’ time, it had </p>
<p>an added notion of becoming a disciple. e one who would follow Jesus, </p>
<p>the Light, will become his disciple and obey his words. e life in the Word </p>
<p>(1:4), now incarnate, is the Light of humankind. It enlightens every one </p>
<p>who believes and obeys him (1:9, 12–13; 12:36, 46). In this sense, those </p>
who follow Jesus can have even now the “light of life,” the divine life be-
<p>lieved to be given at the end-time (1QS 3.7). ey will reect the light of </p>
<p>God in their works (3:21) and know their goal in life, unlike those who </p>
<p>remain in wickedness (3:20; 12:35).</p>
<p>For the Jews, any claim of a crime should be attested by two or three </p>
<p>witnesses (Num 35:30; Deut 17:6; 19:15; cf. 8:17). Later they applied the </p>
<p>same rule for other legal cases also (m. Ketub. 2:9; cf. m. Roš Haš. 3:1).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ignoring that Jesus’ claims have already been attested by at least four wit-</p>
<p>nesses (5:31–47), the Pharisees took Jesus’ declaration of himself as the </p>
<p>Light to be a self-witness and accused him that his testimony (to himself) </p>
<p>is not trustworthy (8:13). As Jesus does the works of God in oneness with </p>
<p>him, both the Father and the Son witness together (5:19–20; 8:18). ere-</p>
<p>fore, even if it seems outwardly that Jesus alone bears witness to himself, his </p>
<p>witness is genuine and trustworthy (8:14a). He attacked the Pharisees that </p>
<p>they did not understand that he came from the Father and that he goes back </p>
<p>to the Father (8:14b). at is why they did not perceive that Jesus’ testimony </p>
<p>to himself as the Light of the world is genuine, for Jesus testies to what he </p>
<p>has seen and heard from the Father (3:31–32; 6:46; 8:26).</p>
<p>Jesus charged the leaders that they judge according to the esh (8:15). </p>
<p>Flesh belongs to the earth, and those who belong to the earthly domain </p>
<p>cannot grasp spiritual things (3:6; 6:63) and they judge only by appearances </p>
<p>(7:24), in contrast to Jesus, who does not judge anyone according to the </p>
