<p>e Baptist’s testimony to Jesus</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>Why should Jesus’ disciples baptize people, when the Baptist was al-</p>
<p>ready giving baptism at Aenon near Salim where there was much water </p>
<p>(3:23)?</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Probably the crowd, which followed Jesus in larger number than</p>
<p>that which followed the Baptist (3:26; 4:1), asked for baptism similar to that </p>
<p>given by the Baptist. e disciples gave baptism with Jesus’ approval and in </p>
<p>his name. e narrator comments that John the Baptist had not yet been </p>
<p>put in prison (3:24). is comment means that Jesus’ ministry in Judea </p>
<p>began before the arrest of the Baptist, whereas his ministry in Galilee began </p>
<p>aer his imprisonment (Mark 1:14). </p>
<p>ere arose a controversy over the rite of purication between the </p>
<p>Baptist’s disciples and a Jew, who might have been one of “the Jews” (3:25). </p>
<p>Since baptism was treated as a rite of purication in Judaism, the Jew might </p>
<p>have questioned the credibility of the Baptist’s baptism compared to the </p>
<p>baptism given by Jesus’ disciples, which attracted more people. Because the </p>
<p>Baptist’s disciples, at least some of them, were provoked to jealousy, they </p>
<p>came to their master and complained that many were going to Jesus to be </p>
<p>baptized.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> Without rightly understanding Jesus in spite of the Baptist’s ear-</p>
<p>lier witness (1:29–34), they refer to Jesus in the third person, “He who was </p>
<p>with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testied” (3:26a). ey con-</p>
<p>sidered Jesus as a rival to the Baptist, whom they mistook as the Christ. is </p>
<p>setting gives an occasion for the Baptist to intensify his witness to Jesus.</p>
<p>e Baptist speaks rst proverbially by saying that no human can re-</p>
<p>ceive even one thing unless it is given from heaven (3:27), that is, “from </p>
<p>God who dwells above in heaven” (cf. 3:3; 8:23; 19:11). Jesus was involved </p>
<p>in God’s mission with the authority that comes from God. en the Bap-</p>
<p>tist speaks factually by reminding them of his witness that he was not the </p>
<p>Christ, although he was sent chronologically before Jesus (3:28; cf. 1:20, </p>
<p>23, 30). e phrase “you yourself bear me witness” shows that when the </p>
<p>Baptist was being probed by the “Jews” on his identity, his disciples had </p>
<p>heard his testimony (cf. 1:19–28). e Baptist conrms the greatness of </p>
<p>Jesus by speaking metaphorically that Jesus is a bridegroom and he himself </p>
<p>is the “friend” or the “best man,” whose function is to stand and hear the </p>
<p>bridegroom’s voice on the joyful occasion of the wedding (3:29). e bride-</p>
<p>groom is naturally more signicant than the best man. In the OT the word </p>
<p>8. e name “Aenon” may come from the Hebrew word ‘ayin, “spring,” implying that </p>
<p>there were more springs of water; Kruse 2008: 121.</p>
<p>9. e complaint that “all are going to him” (3:26b) is an exaggeration, meaning that </p>
<p>many people are going to Jesus (cf. 4:1; 11:48; 12:19).</p>
