<p>John 19:1–16</p>

<p>e instigation to crucify Jesus comes from “the Jews,” who are altogether </p>
<p>responsible for having crucied Jesus. However, Pilate makes his last at-</p>
<p>tempt to release Jesus by asking, “Shall I crucify your king?” (19:15b) in </p>
<p>which “your king” is emphasized in Greek. e chief priests, on behalf of </p>
<p>all accusers, answer, “We have no king except Caesar” (19:15c). In fact, </p>
<p>Yahweh alone is the King of Israel (e.g., Judg 8:2; 1 Sam 8:7). e eleventh </p>
<p>of the “eighteen benedictions” prays, “May you [i.e., God] be our King, you </p>
<p>alone!,” for the Jews expected God’s kingdom to be set up through his Mes-</p>
<p>siah, the King of Israel (12:13). By confessing Caesar alone as their king, </p>
<p>“the Jews” deny in practice God’s kingship over them and their messianic </p>
<p>hope. Politically, they do not accept Caesar’s kingship over them. However, </p>
<p>they confess him as king hypocritically to get Jesus crucied. Pilate nally </p>
<p>surrenders to the demands of “the Jews” and hands over Jesus to them to be </p>
<p>crucied. ey then receive Jesus from the Roman court. For Pilate, Jesus is </p>
<p>the King of the Jews who deserves no death penalty. us Jesus wins in the </p>
<p>trial by witnessing to truth.</p>
<p>Jesus’ reign from the cross (19:17–30) </p>
<p>Although “the Jews” received Jesus in their custody and possibly handed </p>
<p>him over to the soldiers (19:18, 23), it was Jesus who voluntarily “went out” </p>
<p>of the praetorium. He carried his “own cross,” the cross on which he was </p>
<p>to be crucied, and went to the place called Golgotha, or gulgoltā, which </p>
<p>means in Aramaic “a skull” (John19:17; cf. Matt 27:33 par.). e place was </p>
<p>called so because it looked like the top of a skull.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>By carrying the cross,</p>
<p>Jesus was carrying the sins of the world to put them to death (John 1:29; cf. </p>
<p>Rom 3:23–26). On Golgotha, a higher place outside Jerusalem, they (i.e., </p>
<p>the Roman soldiers) crucied him on behalf of “the Jews.” at is, they </p>
<p>nailed Jesus’ forearms stretched on both sides and his feet held together on </p>
<p>the cross. Normally crucixion nails were driven higher up on the arms to </p>
<p>enable the crucied ones to keep hanging on the cross.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Crucixion was</p>
<p>the most shameful and physically agonizing form of death sanctioned by the </p>
<p>emperor himself for slaves, bandits, prisoners of war, and revolutionaries.</p>

<p>ion is widely known as “Calvary.”</p>
