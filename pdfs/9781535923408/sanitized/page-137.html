<p>sheep, in turn, will know their shepherd by receiving his words and believ-</p>
<p>ing that he is from God and that he was sent by God (17:8).</p>
<p>As they know each other mutually, their mutual relationship gives </p>
<p>Jesus, the owner, a claim on the sheep that no hireling can make.</p>

<p>intimacy is essentially the same as that of the Son with the Father, and Jesus </p>
<p>sacrices his life for the prosperity of the sheep out of his relationship es-</p>
<p>tablished by a new covenant (10:15). </p>
<p>e shepherd’s goodness is also reected in his remembrance of “other </p>
<p>sheep,” the non-Jews, to bring them into his sheepfold. ey also will be-</p>
<p>come his own sheep who will recognize and obey his voice. In Jesus, the </p>
<p>eschatological ingathering of Jews and Gentiles is dawned (cf. Isa 56:6–8; </p>
<p>66:18–21; Zech 14:16). Eventually, the ock will have both Jews and non-</p>
<p>Jews who believe in Jesus and they all will become “one ock” having “one </p>
<p>shepherd” (10:16). Jesus’ love and care are not limited to Jews alone, but </p>
<p>they include the Gentiles also. is oneness goes beyond “one stick/nation” </p>
<p>and “one king/shepherd,” which refer to the unity of Israelites alone (Ezek </p>
<p>37:15–24; cf. Zech 14:9), to all nationalities. e oneness, created by the </p>
<p>sacricial death of Jesus, is the hallmark of God’s new community, which </p>
<p>progresses under “one shepherd,” Jesus.</p>
<p>e declaration “Because of this the Father loves me, because I lay </p>
<p>down my life” (10:17) does not mean that the Father’s love for the Son is </p>
<p>conditioned by Son’s obedience to sacrice his life. It is entirely the Son’s </p>
<p>voluntary act (“I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take </p>
<p>it again”; 10:18), which is anchored on the Father’s love for him (3:16). e </p>
<p>idea of taking back the life laid down, which occurs twice (10:17–18), antic-</p>
<p>ipates Jesus’ resurrection. His death, followed by his resurrection, is indeed </p>
<p>a command received from the Father out of his love (10:18b). Where there </p>
<p>is love relationship, there is a command to obey to preserve intimacy (cf. </p>
<p>Gen 3; Rom 5:12–21).</p>
Jesus’ words cause division among the Jewish people (10:19; cf. 7:43;
<p>9:16). Without understanding the imagery used by Jesus, many of them </p>
<p>accuse, “He has a demon and he is mad” (cf. 7:20; 8:48), and therefore they </p>
<p>need not listen to his words (10:20). Both the accusations, “he has a demon” </p>
<p>and “he is mad,” are interrelated, meaning, “he is out of his mind” (Mark </p>
<p>3:21–22). Others, however, do not accept Jesus’ words as those of a demo-</p>
<p>niac, because a demon could not have opened the eyes of the blind (10:21; </p>
<p>9:32). </p>
