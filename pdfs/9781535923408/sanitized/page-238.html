<p>Final Reference to Peter and the Beloved Disciple</p>
<p>210</p>
<p>same question a third time. Peter is grieved because Jesus asked him the </p>
<p>third time, “Do you love me?” Now Peter responds with grief, “Lord, you </p>
<p>know all things; you know that I love you” (21:17).</p>
<p>Jesus’ three times repeated question would have reminded Peter of </p>
<p>his denial of Jesus three times and of his vain boasting (13:37–38). Peter </p>
<p>pledged his loyalty without realizing his human weakness. Aer he denied </p>
<p>Jesus three times, he was grieved realizing that he miserably failed to follow </p>
<p>Jesus at any cost. e Synoptic Gospels record that Peter expressed his grief </p>
<p>by weeping bitterly (Matt 26:75 par.). In John, Peter’s desperate answer, </p>
<p>“Lord, you know all things . . . ,” acknowledges humbly his past failure. </p>
<p>Jesus knows that Peter loves him in spite of his vulnerability. Soon aer </p>
<p>Peter’s acknowledgment of his failure to follow Jesus, Jesus commands him </p>
<p>the third time, “Feed my sheep” (21:17b), a combination of “feed” in 21:15 </p>
<p>and “sheep” in 21:16. Jesus’ three-time injunction conrms his call for Peter </p>
<p>to give pastoral care and nourishment to his new community. is charge, </p>
<p>however, does not make Peter superior to the beloved disciple or to any </p>
<p>other disciples. ere is a cost involved in this call. at is, as a shepherd, </p>
<p>he has to surrender himself to death (21:18–19).</p>
<p>Jesus discloses to Peter the conrmed heavenly truth regarding his </p>
<p>future destiny by using his “truly, truly, I say to you” formula. When Peter </p>
<p>was young, he girded himself by a towel or belt and walked around freely </p>
<p>wherever he liked to go. However, when he becomes old, he will voluntarily </p>
<p>submit his hands, by stretching them out, to be bound and executed.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> An-</p>
<p>other will gird him, perhaps by a chain, and carry him to a place where he </p>
<p>does not want to go. Peter needs to give up his own will and follow Jesus, </p>
<p>the good shepherd, in suering and death. e narrator rightly comments </p>
<p>that Jesus predicted it to show by what death Peter will glorify God (21:19; </p>
<p>cf. 12:33; 18:32). As Jesus revealed God’s glory in his death on the cross, so </p>
<p>also his follower Peter will glorify Jesus through his martyrdom.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>Peter cannot face this destiny unless he depends on Jesus and therefore </p>
<p>Jesus exhorts him to keep following him. </p>

<p>15. Later tradition says that Peter was bound to the cross, as someone else girded him </p>
<p>(Tertullian in ca. 212 CE), and that Peter requested to be crucied upside down (Hist. </p>
<p>eccl. 3.1; Acts of Peter 37–39). </p>
