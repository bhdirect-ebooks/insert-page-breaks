<p>John 1:1–5</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>the Father and the Light projected from it are essentially the same and they </p>
<p>were one in existence eternally.</p>
<p>While narrating creation, John’s special attention falls on “human-</p>
<p>kind” (1:4), God’s main focus in creation. e community he envisaged is </p>
<p>a community of human beings, while other creatures were subject to them </p>
<p>(Gen 1:28–30; Rom 8:19–22). As Light, the life in the Logos is the guiding </p>
<p>principle for human life (cf. Ps 27:1; Ps 36:9; Hos 10:12 LXX; Wis 7:26, 27; </p>
<p>Sir 17:11). For John the essence of the Logos is life, which gives light to </p>
<p>human beings enabling them to experience end-time salvation both now </p>
<p>and in future. is idea anticipates the later reference to Jesus as the Light </p>
<p>and life (8:12). </p>
<p>e nature of light is to constantly shine and stand against “darkness” </p>
<p>(1:5). Light and darkness in John are symbols of good and bad qualities </p>
<p>of life, respectively, and they engage in combat against each other. Where </p>
<p>there is light there is no darkness and vice versa. Such dualism is reected </p>
<p>in Qumran writings written in the second and rst centuries BCE (e.g., </p>
<p>1QS 3.19–22; 1QM 13.5–6, 14–15). ese writings use “day” guratively </p>
<p>with “light,” and “night” with “darkness” (1QS 10.1–2), and so also John. </p>
<p>e nature of the Light in 1:5 is in the present tense, “shines,” but that of </p>
<p>darkness is in the past tense, “did not overcome.” is means that the Light </p>
<p>keeps on shining. It exposes evil, guides human beings, illuminates and </p>
<p>transforms human life, and judges human works (3:19–21). e nature of </p>
<p>darkness, however, is to strive to overcome the Light, but the Light won </p>
<p>over darkness once and for all. </p>
<p>Witness of John the Baptist to the Logos (1:6–8, 15)</p>
<p>Following the pre-existence of the Logos-Light, John traces the beginning </p>
<p>of salvation history in John the Baptist, who was sent by God to bear wit-</p>
<p>ness to the Light (1:6–8; cf. Mark 1:1–5; Acts 1:22; 10:37; 13:23–25). </p>
<p>e Greek verb egeneto introduces the Baptist in the statement, “ere </p>
<p>was a man,” and the same word is used to introduce the Word who “became” </p>
<p>esh (1:14a). is sets both Jesus and John the Baptist in the same mission </p>
<p>of bringing God’s salvation to humankind. e task of John the Baptist, </p>
<p>however, is limited only to bearing witness to Jesus so that people may be-</p>
<p>lieve in Jesus as the Light. e task of bearing witness to the Logos-Light is </p>
<p>repeated in 1:8 with an emphatic denial that John the Baptist himself was </p>
<p>the Light. e Baptist was only a lamp whose witness was temporary (5:35). </p>
