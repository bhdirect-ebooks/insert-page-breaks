<p>Introduction</p>
<p>xx</p>
<p>not merely by verbal proclamation, but also by putting the Jesus tradition </p>
<p>in writing. What this disciple spoke and wrote is categorically attested by a </p>
<p>community as “true” (21:24). </p>
<p>e epithet “e Gospel According to John” appears in the papyri </p>
<p>manuscripts P</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> (second century CE) and P</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>(ca. third century CE). Who</p>
<p>is this John? Is he “the disciple whom Jesus loved,” who is traditionally iden-</p>
<p>tied as John the Son of Zebedee? Was he one of the Twelve or a disciple </p>
<p>outside the Twelve? Was he a historical gure or a symbolic gure created </p>
<p>by the writer? Why does he appear only in the later part of the Gospel </p>
<p>(13:23; 19:26–27; 20:2–5, 8; 21:7, 20–24)? Some accept “the disciple whom </p>
<p>Jesus loved” as both a historical and symbolic gure from Judea and as one </p>
<p>of Jesus’ disciples, but not as one of the Twelve.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>ere is little doubt about</p>
<p>the Beloved Disciple as an eyewitness who wrote the Gospel. But scholars </p>
<p>are not sure of the identity of this disciple. </p>
<p>e fact that this unnamed disciple was lying close to the breast of </p>
<p>Jesus during the Passover meal (13:23) gives us the clue that he must have </p>
<p>been one of the twelve disciples of Jesus. Otherwise, John’s use of the phrase </p>
<p>“having loved his own” in the context of Jesus’ supper with them (13:1–2); </p>
<p>the presence of Judas Iscariot (13:2, 27), Simon Peter (13:6, 24, 36, 37), </p>
<p>omas (14:5), Philip (14:8–9), and Judas (not Iscariot; 14:22); Jesus’ exem-</p>
<p>plary act before those who called him “Teacher and Lord” (13:13–15); the </p>
<p>whole “farewell discourse” aer the Supper (13:31–16:33); and Jesus’ sub-</p>
<p>sequent prayer for the men whom God had given to him (17:1–26) would </p>
<p>all be inexplicable. e Synoptic tradition shows that the Twelve alone were </p>
<p>eating the Passover with Jesus (Matt 26:20; Mark 14:17–18; cf. Luke 22:11, </p>
<p>14). e intimate relationship between the Beloved Disciple and Peter and </p>
<p>their complementary roles in the community, as drawn from John (e.g., </p>
<p>13:23; 20:1–10), show that the Beloved Disciple is likely John the Son of Ze-</p>
<p>bedee (cf. Acts 1:13; 3:1, 3, 4, 11; 4:13, 19; 8:14; see also comment on 13:23). </p>
<p>e arguments against the view that the Beloved Disciple is John the Son of </p>
<p>Zebedee</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>depend mainly on the fact that John’s name is plainly mentioned</p>
<p>in the Synoptic Gospels but not in John’s Gospel. is observation ignores </p>
<p>the fact that John uses the Synoptic tradition freely in combination with his </p>
<p>own tradition.</p>
