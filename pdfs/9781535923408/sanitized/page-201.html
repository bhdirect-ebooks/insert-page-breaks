<p>John 18:1–11</p>
<p>173</p>
<p>the events that would happen to him, for “the hour” had come. erefore </p>
<p>instead of leaving the place, he came forward to ask, “Whom do you seek?” </p>
<p>(18:4). ey answered him, “Jesus, the Nazarene,” that is, “Jesus who comes </p>
<p>from Nazareth” (cf. Matt 2:23). Without reservation, Jesus said, “I am he,” </p>
<p>(literally “I, I am”) meaning that he is the presence and revealer of God </p>
<p>whose name is “I Am at I Am” (18:5a). is is conrmed by the captors’ </p>
<p>reaction of drawing back and falling to the ground (18:6), a common reac-</p>
<p>tion to God’s appearance. John’s specic comment that Judas, who betrayed </p>
<p>him, was standing with them (18:5b) shows that Judas has shied himself </p>
<p>from the love of Jesus to the hatred of the world. is nal reference in John </p>
<p>to Judas puts him along with those who rejected and crucied Jesus!</p>
<p>When the soldiers and ocials remained speechless, Jesus takes the </p>
<p>initiative to ask them again, “Whom do you seek?,” and the same response, </p>
<p>“Jesus, the Nazarene,” comes from them (18:7). Jesus uses the same words of </p>
<p>self-revelation, “I am he,” but with the emphatic statement “I told you.” He </p>
<p>takes control of the situation and voluntarily surrenders himself to God’s </p>
<p>will to be arrested (cf. 16:31–32), rather than by Judas’ betrayal of Jesus by </p>
<p>a kiss (Matt 26:48–50 par.). erefore he told them, “If you seek me, allow </p>
<p>these men go” (18:8). Jesus thus proves himself as the good shepherd who </p>
<p>would save the lives of his sheep by voluntarily oering his life (10:11–15, </p>
<p>28; cf. 17:12). Jesus said so to fulll his own saying, “Of those whom you </p>
<p>have given me, I lost no one” (18:9; cf. 17:12; 6:39). Jesus omits the phrase </p>
<p>“except the son of perdition” because Judas is already lost by taking the </p>
<p>side of Jesus’ enemies. e fulllment of Jesus’ words is found only in 18:9, </p>
<p>32, whereas in other places Jesus’ life events and words were in fulllment </p>
<p>of the Scriptures. at is, both the Scriptures’ words and Jesus’ words are </p>
<p>God’s words.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Peter realized that Jesus was going to be arrested and reacted violently </p>
<p>by striking the high priest’s slave with a sword, cutting o his right ear </p>
<p>(18:10). Among the four evangelists, only John gives the slave’s name as </p>
<p>“Malchus,” reecting his historical accuracy.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Possibly, in John, Peter had</p>
<p>a short sword, which could easily be concealed inside the garment.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Since</p>
<p>Peter knew that the ocials were sent by the chief priests and the Pharisees, </p>
<p>he struck the right ear of the high priest’s slave with a vengeful attitude. Like </p>
<p>Matthew, John records Jesus’ command, “Put your sword into its sheath” </p>
