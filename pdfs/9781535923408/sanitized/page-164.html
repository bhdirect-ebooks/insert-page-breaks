<p>Washing of the Disciples’ Feet</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>their feet. Jesus’ act of wiping their feet with his towel recalls Mary’s act of </p>
<p>wiping Jesus’ feet by her hair (11:2; 12:3) and symbolizes his oering of </p>
<p>himself to cleanse his followers from sin.</p>
<p>When Jesus came to Peter to wash his feet, he, with astonishment, </p>
<p>responded, “Lord, do you wash my feet?” (13:6), “You will never wash my </p>
<p>feet” (13:8a). Peter’s refusal shows his misunderstanding that Jesus, the </p>
<p>teacher, should not do a menial job generally. e worldly view of leader-</p>
<p>ship expects the leader to sit in a place of honor during the meal and allow </p>
<p>others to wash his feet and serve him. Jesus reverses the role of patrons </p>
<p>from whom the inferiors would not expect service</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>and thereby denes his</p>
<p>lordship in terms of serving others. Jesus’ response, “What I am doing you </p>
<p>do not know now, but aer these events you will understand” (13:7), antici-</p>
<p>pates his death and resurrection, which will bring to his followers the right </p>
<p>understanding of his life, suering, and death (2:22; 12:16). Jesus’ shedding </p>
<p>of his blood on the cross was necessary to cleanse those who are received </p>
<p>into God’s new community. Disallowing Jesus to wash amounts to unbelief </p>
<p>in the suering Messiah and denial of having partnership with him (13:8b). </p>
<p>us, Jesus’ foot washing is a symbol of cleansing with his blood and of </p>
<p>having fellowship with him. </p>
<p>Wishing to have fellowship with Jesus, Peter said that Jesus might </p>
<p>wash not only his feet, but also his hands and head (13:9). Jesus answered, </p>
<p>“e one who has been bathed does not need to be washed, except for the </p>
<p>feet, but he is wholly clean; and you are clean, but not all” (13:10). We may </p>
<p>take 13:10a as a little parable and 13:10b as its application to all disciples </p>
<p>(cf. 13:16; 4:35a; 8:35),</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>for the statement “You are clean” has a plural “you.”</p>
<p>Guests are already clean and they do not need to take a complete bath dur-</p>
<p>ing supper. However, they may need a slave to wash their feet to remove </p>
<p>the dust.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Similarly, the disciples are already clean by Jesus’ words (15:3),</p>
<p>but they need continuous cleansing by the same words (17:17) to remain </p>
<p>united in his love. However, foreknowing that Judas would soon betray </p>
<p>him, Jesus said, “But not all [are clean]” (13:11; cf. 6:70–71). e washing </p>
<p>was ineective to make Judas clean, because he allowed the devil to control </p>
<p>him (cf. 13:2, 18). One interpretation of Jesus’ foot washing thus points to </p>
<p>his work of cleansing his community.</p>
