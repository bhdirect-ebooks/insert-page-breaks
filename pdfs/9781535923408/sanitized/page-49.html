<p>John 2:1–12</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>the wedding could have been that of one of her relatives or of a close fam-</p>
<p>ily friend. at is why Jesus and his disciples also had been invited. Jesus’ </p>
<p>mother is mentioned throughout John’s Gospel without her name. Brown </p>
<p>thinks that the absence of the name may be to symbolize her as a new Eve </p>
<p>or new Israel, the church.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>However, most probably the avoidance of her</p>
<p>name is just to highlight her earthly relationship to Jesus. Being the mother </p>
<p>of Jesus, she too had a place in Jesus’ new community (cf. 2:12).</p>
<p>e reference to the invitation of Jesus along with his disciples (2:2) </p>
<p>shows how closely the community of Jesus’ disciples had been linked with </p>
<p>him within a short time. e mother of Jesus, as a woman, plays a key role </p>
<p>in the rst sign that Jesus does. Wine, as per Jewish custom, was used in </p>
<p>festive occasions such as weddings.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>e wine used in this wedding ran</p>
<p>out. Jesus’ mother may well have had some responsibility in catering for </p>
<p>the guests,</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>therefore she immediately brought the urgent matter to the</p>
<p>attention of Jesus by telling him, “ey do not have wine” (2:3). Perhaps </p>
<p>she believed that Jesus, being the Son of God, was able to provide for the </p>
<p>need on any occasion. However, Jesus did not do any miracle as his mother </p>
<p>expected. He questioned her, “What is for me and you, O woman?” (2:4a). </p>
<p>e word “O woman” is not a word of disrespect (cf. 19:26). Jesus’ words </p>
<p>“My hour has not yet come” (2:4b) show that Jesus would act to supply </p>
<p>wine in accordance with the will and timing of God rather than his physical </p>
<p>parent. For him, to do the will of the Father was his food (4:34) and so he </p>
<p>did not allow human relationships to direct his steps in his mission. While </p>
<p>this meaning is well taken, the term “hour,” which occurs twenty-six times </p>
<p>in John, has a deeper meaning.</p>
<p>Although Jesus says that his hour has not yet come, later he uses both </p>
<p>present and future tenses to say, “e hour is coming, and now is” (4:23; </p>
<p>5:25; 16:32). Eventually he says, “e hour has come” (12:23, 27; 13:1; 17:1). </p>
<p>e Johannine terms “the hour,” “my hour,” and “his hour” indicate the </p>
<p>time when Jesus will return to the Father through his death and resurrec-</p>
<p>tion. e term “an hour” (the Greek word hōra without the denite article) </p>
<p>refers to the eects that Jesus’ hour would bring in the lives of the believers, </p>
<p>and those eects include the manner of worshipping God, persecution, a </p>
<p>new understanding of Jesus’ words, and the nal resurrection of all humans </p>
