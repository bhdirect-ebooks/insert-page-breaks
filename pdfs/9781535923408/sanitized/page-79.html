<p>John 4:43–54</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>On hearing the good news that his son lives, the ocial believes it </p>
<p>and goes down to Capernaum. “Believing” Jesus’ word is a mark of genuine </p>
<p>faith in John. e man did not see immediately that his son was living, but </p>
<p>he gave full credence to Jesus’ word. Without seeing, he believed (cf. Heb </p>
<p>11:1; 2 Cor 5:7; Rom 8:24–25), unlike Nathanael and omas (1:50; 20:29), </p>
<p>and thus he became a model of a true disciple of Jesus. Jesus’ word that </p>
<p>the child is alive came out of his mouth in the “seventh hour” (1:00 p.m.; </p>
<p>4:52–53). e distance from Capernaum to Cana is sixteen miles by the </p>
<p>shorter road.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>As per the Jewish calculation of time, the day ends at 6:00</p>
<p>p.m. and the ocial was still journeying, perhaps in a cart. As the ocial </p>
<p>was on the way, his servants met him to tell him that his son was living </p>
<p>(4:51). Out of pleasant surprise, the ocer inquired with curiosity</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>of the</p>
<p>hour at which he got better, and they said, “Yesterday at the seventh hour </p>
<p>the fever le him” (4:52).</p>
<p>e father of the child realized that his son was healed at the same </p>
<p>hour when Jesus told him, “Your son lives” (4:53). e coherence of time </p>
<p>convinced the ocial of the supernatural power of Jesus’ word and also </p>
<p>of the fact that God was in Jesus. at the ocer did not think of Jesus as </p>
a “divine man” or a “wonder worker,” but as the manifestation of God, is
<p>known from the faith he exercised along with his household. e healing </p>
<p>power of Jesus led a Gentile ocer, along with his family, into Jesus’ newly </p>
<p>founded community. e sign endorses the truth that the Gentiles too have </p>
<p>a role to play in Jesus’ community.</p>
<p>John numbers this healing as the second sign that Jesus did, aer he </p>
<p>came to Galilee from Judea (4:54). John’s counting of signs does not mean </p>
<p>that he used what is called a “signs source,” but it means that Jesus’ rst </p>
<p>phase of ministry in Galilee started with a miracle in Cana and ends with </p>
<p>another miracle performed in the same place.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons</p>
<p>Several churches are functioning today exclusively for the people of their own </p>
<p>region or culture or caste or class or denomination. They do not accept believ-</p>
<p>ers who come to their churches from other culture or caste than theirs into full </p>
<p>27. Brown (1978: 1.191) calculates the distance as twenty miles.</p>
<p>28. e same Greek verb pynthanesthai (“to inquire”) in 13:24 carries a sense of cu-</p>
<p>riosity and a strong desire to know some piece of information; Köstenberger 2009: 171.</p>
