<p>John 20:11–18</p>

<p>Mary pleaded with him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where </p>
<p>you have placed him, and I shall take him away” (20:15b). Ironically, she </p>
<p>asked the living Jesus for his own dead body! At this point Jesus revealed </p>
<p>his identity as the risen one by calling her, “Mary.” Now she, as his sheep, </p>
<p>recognized Jesus by his voice (cf. 10:3, 27). She made a second turning to-</p>
<p>wards him with a sense of wonder and recognition and called him, in He-</p>
<p>brew, “Rabboni!” (in Aramaic, Rabbuni), meaning, “my Teacher” (20:16). </p>
<p>She claimed Jesus earlier as “my Lord” (20:13). Both “Lord” and “Teacher” </p>
<p>are complementary titles (13:13–14). e rst disciples addressed Jesus as </p>
<p>“Rabbi” (1:38). By addressing Jesus with the same title, Mary proves herself </p>
<p>to be his female disciple!</p>
<p>Jesus’ words “Do not hold on to me,” which means, “Stop clinging to </p>
<p>me,” presuppose that Mary was about to touch Jesus, perhaps his feet, and </p>
<p>cling on to him with joy. e reason is that he had not yet ascended to the </p>
<p>Father (20:17a). is does not mean that Mary can touch Jesus aer his </p>
<p>ascension. His invitation to omas to touch his wounds (20:27) does not </p>
<p>mean that Jesus’ ascension took place before he appeared to omas. ere </p>
<p>is no reference that omas touched the wounds in Jesus’ body. It was an </p>
<p>invitation in order to lead omas to believe in the risen Jesus, whereas </p>
<p>Mary had already believed in Jesus’ resurrection. erefore the particle </p>
<p>“for” is to be taken with Jesus’ command to Mary to go to “my brothers” </p>
<p>and announce the message that he is on the process of ascending “to my </p>
<p>Father and your Father, to my God and your God” (20:17b). If so, then </p>
<p>Jesus’ command not to hold on to him is to hasten her to go to his disciples </p>
<p>and convey the message (cf. Matt 28:7–8).</p>
<p>Jesus is now in the process of ascending to the Father aer resurrec-</p>
<p>tion (cf. 13:1). While there is a distinction between Jesus’ relationship with </p>
<p>the Father as his only Son and that of his disciples, the phrase, “my Father </p>
<p>and your Father, my God and your God,” arms the oneness with which </p>
<p>his followers can now approach God through Jesus by virtue of his death </p>
<p>and resurrection. Jesus sends Mary to tell them of his ascent to the Father, </p>
<p>and of the new lial relationship that is established now by naming them </p>
<p>as “my brothers” (cf. 13:33; 16:14–15). is designation conrms that Jesus </p>
<p>is risen indeed and that he has created a new family of God, the church (cf. </p>
<p>19:26–27). </p>
<p>Mary Magdalene goes and testies before the disciples, “I have seen </p>
<p>the Lord” (20:18), so that they may believe that Jesus is alive. For the </p>
<p>rst-century Christians “seeing” the risen Jesus was the primary mark of </p>
