<p>e second scene takes place inside. Pilate came in to Jesus to inquire </p>
<p>whether he is the King of the Jews (18:33), a central theme in the passion </p>
<p>narrative. is question is abruptly raised, as Jesus’ claim to be the King </p>
<p>of the Jews is nowhere recorded in John’s passion narrative (cf. Matt 27:11 </p>
<p>par.). Pilate raised this question probably by guessing that the accusation </p>
<p>could be of political nature, if not concerned with Jewish religion. He him-</p>
<p>self asked Jesus, “What did you do?” (18:35), to ascertain the exact nature </p>
<p>of accusation. However, Jesus’ counter-question, “Do you say this on your </p>
<p>own accord or did others tell you about me?” (18:34), presupposes that </p>
<p>Pilate had probably been apprised of Jesus’ mission with a politically sub-</p>
<p>versive interpretation by his accusers.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Jesus’ description of the nature of</p>
<p>his kingship (18:36) arms indirectly that he is the King of the Jews, but </p>
<p>with a dierent nature from the world’s understanding of a king.</p>
<p>Jesus’ counter-question provokes Pilate to say, “I am not a Jew, am I? </p>
<p>Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me; what </p>
<p>did you do?” (18:35). Pilate uses the word “Jew” purely in an ethnic sense, </p>
<p>though the word in 18:36 could denote the unbelieving world. John, in </p>
<p>his literary style, brings out from a Gentile ruler the truth that it was his </p>
<p>own people, the Jewish nation and its religious authorities, who handed </p>
<p>over Jesus to him and who eventually were responsible to crucify Jesus (cf. </p>
<p>1:11). Since Jesus is a Jew, and not Pilate, he should clarify if he has done </p>
<p>evil against his own people who seek to kill him lawfully. In answer, Jesus </p>
<p>periphrastically acknowledges that he is the King of the Jews, but openly </p>
<p>claries that his kingship is not “of this world,” that is, it does not have the </p>
<p>worldly splendor and military empowerment. If it were, then his “servants,” </p>
<p>those who believed and followed him, would have fought with swords that </p>
<p>Jesus would not be delivered to “the Jews,” who accused him religiously and </p>
<p>politically (cf. 18:10–11). However, his reign does not have its origin in this </p>
<p>world (the Greek enteuthen means “from here,” denoting “from the world”), </p>
<p>but in heaven (18:36). at is, his kingship is God’s kingship, which is to be </p>
established by Jesus’ divine love, suering, a shameful death on the cross,
<p>and his nal ascension to the Father.</p>
<p>Pilate could grasp that Jesus is the king and therefore asks him, “So </p>
<p>you are a king, aren’t you?” (18:37a). Aer hearing of the humble nature </p>
<p>of Jesus’ kingship, which has no political aspirations, the Gentile governor </p>
<p>declares that Jesus is a king. ough Jesus avoided being made king earlier </p>
<p>(6:15), he accepts before Pilate that he is a king, for the “hour” has come to </p>
