<p>Fusing the Horizons</p>
<p>John’s passion narrative presents Jesus sacriﬁced on the cross for the deliver-</p>
<p>ance of humankind from sin and eternal death. The idea of sacriﬁce to get rid </p>
<p>of one’s sins is present particularly in Hinduism. For example, the Vedas speak </p>
<p>of praja¯ pati, the God-become-man and the Lord of creatures offering himself </p>
<p>mystically for creatures in a body ﬁt for sacriﬁce. The Ta¯ ndya-bra¯ hmana refers </p>
<p>to “the Lord of creatures” (praja¯ pati), who offered himself a sacriﬁce for the </p>
<p>gods and thus the Vedic praja¯ pati is both a priest and victim.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>Thus, Hinduism</p>
recognizes the institution of sacriﬁce as a divinely appointed ordinance in the
<p>same way as the institution of sacriﬁce appears in the OT. John pictures Jesus </p>
<p>voluntarily giving himself to be sacriﬁced on the cross to give fullness of life to </p>
<p>humanity. By being both the sacriﬁce and the priest who offers it, Jesus fulﬁlls </p>
<p>the role of praja¯ pati of Rig Veda. K. M. Banerjea (nineteenth century CE) </p>
<p>rightly observed that the pure faith to which the Vedas testify is found in its </p>
<p>fullness in Jesus, the agent of creation and the true self-sacriﬁcing praja¯ pati.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Therefore we no longer need human or animal sacriﬁces to please God or to </p>
<p>be expiation for human sins. We may see in John, then, that Jesus, who came </p>
<p>into the world to offer himself as a sacriﬁce for human sin, is the fulﬁllment </p>
<p>not merely of the Jewish scriptures, but also of the Hindu scriptures and of the </p>
<p>aspirations of all other religions.</p>

<p>Jesus testiﬁed before Pilate that he came to bear witness to the truth. </p>
<p>Many sages, philosophers, and freedom ﬁghters, like Mahatma Gandhi, who </p>
<p>wrote his book My Experiment with Truth, have searched for and examined </p>
<p>truth. They have also practiced truth at the human level and on an experi-</p>
<p>mental basis. But they themselves could not experience the heavenly truth </p>
<p>revealed in Jesus. John projects Jesus himself as the truth (14:6) and the </p>
<p>one who communicates truth. Jesus came from heaven to testify to the truth </p>
<p>by giving ﬁrsthand testimony of God’s character, the truth. For John, truth </p>
