<p>Mary Magdalene, an Apostle to the Apostles</p>
<p>198</p>
<p>apostolic witness (20:25; cf. 1 Cor 15:3–9). In this sense, Mary is an apostle </p>
<p>who not only saw the risen Lord rst, but also announced the message of </p>
<p>Jesus’ empty tomb to two disciples (20:1–2) and then the message that Jesus </p>
<p>is risen to the eleven disciples. us, she is “the apostle to the apostles.”</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mary Magdalene links the “empty tomb” tradition and the appearances of </p>
<p>the risen Jesus. e Johannine resurrection narrative shows concern on </p>
<p>gender roles and on the relation between faith and sight—the faith of men </p>
<p>(20:8) and the prophetic vision of a woman (20:12, 18).</p>

<p>Jesus’ appearances to the male disciples (20:19–29) </p>
<p>Appearance and empowerment (20:19–23) </p>
<p>Aer the risen Jesus revealed himself to his female disciple, he now appears </p>
<p>to ten of his male disciples (excluding Judas Iscariot and omas), who </p>
<p>were behind the shut doors out of fear for “the Jews” (cf. 7:13; 9:22; 19:38). </p>
<p>ey might have hid themselves out of fear because of rumors that they </p>
<p>had stolen the body of Jesus to claim that Jesus was risen from the dead (cf. </p>
<p>Matt 28:13).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>However, on the evening of the day, which was the rst day</p>
<p>of the week (Sunday), Jesus came through the shut doors, stood among his </p>
<p>disciples, and greeted them, “Peace be with you” (20:19). is is a greeting </p>
<p>normally used by the Jews, particularly by heavenly beings when they ap-</p>
<p>peared (Judg 6:23; 1 Sam 25:6). In the context of Jesus’ appearance to the </p>
<p>troubled and fearful disciples, the greeting assured them of peace (cf. 14:27; </p>
<p>16:33).</p>
<p>Aer this, Jesus showed his hands (i.e., his wounded forearms) and his </p>
<p>side (20:20a). Since John alone narrates the piercing of Jesus’ side (19:34), </p>
<p>he mentions that Jesus showed his side, rather than his feet (Luke 24:39), </p>
<p>to assure them that he was the same Jesus who was crucied. en the </p>
<p>disciples could perceive him as Jesus, the risen Lord, and rejoiced on see-</p>
<p>ing him. rough this appearance Jesus revealed himself as the one who </p>
<p>overcame death and who lives forever. It also partly fullls Jesus’ earlier </p>
<p>promise that “Your sorrow will turn into joy” (16:20, 22) when they see him </p>
<p>again (14:19; 16:16).</p>

<p>8. Gospel of Peter 26 mentions that the disciples were being sought aer as if they </p>
<p>were evildoers who wanted to set re to the temple.</p>
