<p>Revelation of God’s name demands obedience to God’s word, and</p>
<p>Jesus submits to the Father that his disciples have obeyed his word (17:6).</p>
<p>Jesus commends his disciples for understanding God as the origin of </p>
<p>all gis that Jesus holds when they saw God’s name/glory in him (17:7). </p>
<p>e words that Jesus gave to them are God’s words (3:34; 8:28; 12:49). Jesus </p>
<p>acknowledges before God that his disciples have received those words. In </p>
<p>consequence, they knew genuinely that Jesus came from God and believed </p>
<p>that it is the Father who sent Jesus (17:8). Here “knowing” and “believing” </p>
<p>are used in parallel terms, and the word “truly” means “genuinely.” Jesus </p>
<p>prays for the twelve disciples, and not for the world, because the former </p>
<p>have to be built up rst as God’s own people who have entered into the cov-</p>
<p>enantal relationship with God through Jesus (John 17:9; cf. Exod 19:5–6). </p>
<p>Jesus and the Father are one and therefore all those who belong to Jesus </p>
<p>(literally “all things,” meaning “all possession”) are God’s and all those who </p>
<p>belong to God are Jesus’. Into this mutual relationship the believing com-</p>
<p>munity also is graed, and therefore Jesus is gloried in them (17:10). ey </p>
<p>have seen God’s glory in Jesus throughout his earthly ministry.</p>
<p>As his departure is at hand, Jesus says, “I am no longer in the world, </p>
<p>but they are in the world.” erefore he prays to the Father to protect his fol-</p>
<p>lowers in the authority of his name, which God has given to Jesus (17:11a). </p>
<p>Jesus calls God “the Holy Father,” highlighting the truth that God’s char-</p>
<p>acter is morally pure and separated from the world (Ps 111:9; Isa 6:3; Lev </p>
<p>11:44; cf. 2 Macc 14:36; 3 Macc 2:2).</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Both God and Jesus are one in love</p>
<p>and glory (17:22), and Jesus prays that his disciples also may similarly be </p>
<p>one (17:11b). </p>
<p>Jesus has kept the disciples in God’s powerful name that was given to </p>
<p>him while he was with them (17:12a). is is paralleled with “I guarded </p>
<p>them” so well that none of them were lost (17:12b). Here is a picture of </p>
<p>a good shepherd who protects his sheep from perishing (10:10–14, 28). </p>
<p>However, Jesus exempts one disciple, called “the son of perdition,” a Semitic </p>
<p>expression for the one who is irrevocably lost.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>He is Judas Iscariot, who</p>
<p>turned against Jesus (6:70; 13:18) and who was lost in fulllment of the </p>
<p>Scriptures. at is, Judas’ betrayal took place as per the written will of God. </p>
<p>John probably had in mind Pss 41:9; 69:25; and 109:8 (cf. Acts 1:20). e </p>
<p>loss of one disciple cannot stop Jesus from returning to the Father (17:13a). </p>
