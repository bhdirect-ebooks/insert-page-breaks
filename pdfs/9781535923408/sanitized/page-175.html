<p>John 14:1–14</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>Jesus does and, in fact, greater works than these, because Jesus is going to </p>
<p>the Father (14:12). Faith without doing Jesus’ works is dead (Jas 2:14–26). </p>
<p>e believers will not only perform miracles, but also will speak words of </p>
<p>salvation to the world. us they will make the community founded by </p>
<p>Jesus grow. Doing “greater works” does not make his followers greater than </p>
<p>Jesus, because those works will be done actually by the Holy Spirit, who will </p>
<p>be bestowed on them aer Jesus goes to the Father (7:39; 16:7). e “greater </p>
<p>works” include convicting the world of sin, judgment, and righteousness </p>
<p>(16:7–11) and forgiving or retaining the sins of others (20:23). Jesus’ work </p>
<p>of salvation will be done through his community in greater glory by the </p>
<p>power of the Spirit.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Nevertheless, greater works cannot be done unless the church prays </p>
<p>to God through Jesus. If his followers pray for anything in Jesus’ name, </p>
<p>Jesus promises that he will do it. is idea is repeated twice (14:13–14) </p>
<p>to conrm the eect of prayer, an outward expression of inward faith and </p>
<p>dependence. e terms “whatever you ask,” and “if you ask me anything” </p>
<p>denote the content of prayers. e context of 14:13–14 suggests that the </p>
<p>content of prayer is related to “our part in God’s plans.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> God’s new com-</p>
<p>munity may pray for power and wisdom to do his works and show Jesus to </p>
<p>the world as God’s self-manifestation. “In my name” implies prayer oered </p>
<p>by relying upon Jesus’ work of salvation accomplished on the cross. Jesus’ </p>
<p>name is God’s name delegated on him (5:43; 10:25; 12:13; 17:6, 11–12, 26). </p>
<p>erefore when the church prays in Jesus’ name, it claims the authority of </p>
<p>God to grant what it asks for. With God-given authority Jesus promises, “I </p>
<p>will do it.” Both receiving prayers and granting what are asked for are col-</p>
<p>lective responsibilities of the Father and the Son (14:13–14; 15:16; 16:23).</p>
<p>Jesus’ promise to send the paraklētos (14:15–31) </p>
<p>Besides his command to love one another, Jesus speaks of his disciples’ love </p>
<p>for him. If they love him, they will obey his commandments (14:15, 23–24). </p>
<p>e plural “commandments” includes his command to wash one another’s </p>
<p>feet (13:14–15), to love one another (13:34; 15:12), to believe in the oneness </p>
<p>of the Father and the Son (14:8–11), and to ask him anything in his name </p>
<p>(14:13–14). Jesus’ love for his followers is expressed in his prayer to God </p>
<p>for them (cf. 6:11; 11:41–42; 17:1–26). He promises that he will pray to </p>
<p>8. Cf. Kanagaraj 2005: 471.</p>
