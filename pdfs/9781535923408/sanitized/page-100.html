<p>Jesus’ Self-Revelation as the Life-Giving Bread</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>of the new covenant is that God will put his Law within the hearts of his </p>
<p>people so that they may know the Lord without having to be taught by </p>
<p>others (Jer 31:33–34; cf. Ps 78:1–8) but by the Lord (Isa 54:7, 13). ese </p>
<p>prophecies are fullled in Jesus (cf. 5:39, 46), especially in his exaltation on </p>
<p>the cross, when the Father will draw all, taught by God, to Jesus. ose who </p>
<p>are thus drawn to Jesus constitute the new covenant community. </p>
<p>Jesus reiterates that he is from God and claims that no one has seen the </p>
<p>Father except the one who is from God. He makes an absolute claim, “he </p>
<p>has seen the Father” (6:46), in which the subject “he” is put in an emphatic </p>
<p>position in Greek (cf. 1:18; 3:32). While “[he] who is from God” implies Je-</p>
<p>sus’ pre-existence with God, the statement “he has seen the Father” implies </p>
<p>his intimate and eternal relationship with the Father. erefore Jesus could </p>
<p>solemnly arm that anyone who receives him by faith has eternal life, the </p>
<p>life of communion with God, even in this age (6:47). By categorically stat-</p>
<p>ing, “I am the bread of life” (6:48), Jesus presents himself as the revelation </p>
<p>of the life-giving God (cf. 6:33, 35).</p>
<p>Jesus counteracts to the boastful statement of “the Jews,” “Our fathers </p>
<p>ate manna in the wilderness” (6:31), by stating that all their fathers who ate </p>
<p>manna died (6:49). By saying “your fathers,” Jesus distances himself from </p>
<p>the unbelieving Jews who sought Jesus for earthly food alone. e manna </p>
<p>satised the physical hunger of Israelites, but they all died without enjoying </p>
<p>the needed life with God. Similarly, the loaves supplied by Jesus satised the </p>
<p>Galileans’ physical hunger, but they could not believe him and experience </p>
<p>eternal life.</p>
<p>In contrast to the bread eaten in the wilderness, Jesus is “the bread that </p>
<p>comes down from heaven.” He connects his heavenly origin with the hu-</p>
<p>man response of “eating” lest those who eat it are overcome by death (6:50). </p>
<p>For the rst time the word “eating” is introduced (cf. 6:51), anticipating its </p>
<p>link with “drinking.” If anyone eats of the bread from heaven, that person </p>
<p>will have heavenly life without undergoing the eternal punishment of death </p>
<p>both now and in future (cf. 3:16; 6:27, 35, 40). “Eating” metaphorically </p>
<p>means “coming” to Jesus and “believing” in him (6:35).</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>e content of 6:48, 50 is interpreted in 6:51 with the addition of “and </p>
<p>the bread that I shall give for the life of the world is my esh.” John uses </p>
<p>the adjectival participle to identify Jesus as “the living bread.” His “coming </p>
<p>down from heaven” means his eternal existence in heaven with God and his </p>
<p>entry into the world in human esh, as the word “my esh,” used rst time </p>
<p>25. Neyrey (2007: 127) comments that “eating” means believing and consuming food.</p>
