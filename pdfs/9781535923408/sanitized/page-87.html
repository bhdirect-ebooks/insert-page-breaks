<p>John 5:31–47</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>1. John the Baptist is the rst witness to Jesus’ rank and status. “You sent </p>
<p>to John,” recalls the delegation of priests and Levites sent to the Bap-</p>
<p>tist by Jewish authorities (1:19–28). e Baptist categorically denied </p>
<p>that he was the Christ and bore witness to the pre-existent Christ. For </p>
<p>him, Jesus’ rank and status are far greater and earlier than his. Jesus </p>
<p>sums up the Baptist’s witness as to the “truth” (5:33), referring to his </p>
<p>valid message that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>(cf. 1:7–8, 15,</p>
<p>29–36; 3:26–30). However, Jesus cautions his adversaries that he never </p>
<p>received the testimony from a human (cf. Gal 1:11–12), but that he </p>
<p>only reminds them of the Baptist’s witness so that they may be saved </p>
<p>(5:34). He also arms that the Baptist was a “burning and shining </p>
<p>lamp” in whose light, however, they were rejoicing for “an hour,” i.e., </p>
<p>for a time as short as an hour (5:35). e Baptist was “an ordinary </p>
<p>portable lamp” who gave light by his witness to the Light. at the </p>
<p>Baptist was a lamp may be the fulllment of Ps 132:17b. “e Jews” </p>
<p>believed temporarily that he was the long-awaited Christ and hence </p>
<p>they were in “exuberant joy.” However, their joy quickly faded away </p>
<p>aer they understood that he was not the Christ.</p>
<p>2. Jesus’ own works given to him by the Father to accomplish testify that </p>
<p>the Father has sent Jesus (5:36). at is, the authority to heal the sick </p>
<p>ows from God and it cannot be bound by mere legal observance of </p>
<p>the Sabbath. Jesus’ “works” are doubly emphasized and God’s purpose </p>
<p>in granting those works is to nish doing them (cf. 4:34; 17:4). e </p>
<p>plural “works” implies all forms of Jesus’ signs, which eventually led </p>
<p>him to the greatest sign of dying on the cross to save humanity. In this </p>
<p>sense, the witness of Jesus’ works is greater than that of the Baptist.</p>
<p>3. Jesus discloses that “there is another” who bears witness to him (5:32) </p>
<p>as “the Father who sent me” (5:37) and himself as the one whom the </p>
<p>Father sent (5:38). “Sending” hints at the pre-existence of the Son with </p>
<p>the Father and at their mutual knowing due to eternal relationship </p>
<p>with one another (7:29; 10:15). Since the Son is from the Father, he </p>
<p>alone can reveal the unknowable God to human beings (1:18; 6:46).</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Otherwise they can never see God, just as the people of Israel, who </p>
<p>never heard God’s voice (Deut 5:24–26) nor saw his form (Exod </p>
<p>20:19, 22; Deut 4:15, 33, 36). Moreover, “sending” expresses the Son’s </p>
