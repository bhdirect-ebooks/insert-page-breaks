<p>e Aermath of Jesus’ Death</p>

<p>with Samaria. He was a rich man (Matt 27:57), a respected member of the </p>
<p>Sanhedrin, and a good and righteous man, who himself was looking for </p>
<p>the kingdom of God (Mark 15:43; Luke 23:50). However, out of his fear </p>
<p>for Jewish authorities, he did not confess Jesus openly as the Christ lest he </p>
<p>be excommunicated from the synagogue (cf. 7:13; 9:22; 12:42; 20:19). But </p>
<p>aer crucixion, he got courage to show himself a disciple of Jesus and took </p>
<p>away Jesus’ body with the knowledge of “the Jews” and Roman soldiers. </p>
<p>Jesus, exalted on the cross, drew such a fearful disciple unto him (cf. 12:32)! </p>
<p>Nicodemus, who came to Jesus earlier at night (3:2), came now obvi-</p>
<p>ously during daytime and joined Joseph in burying Jesus by bringing about </p>
<p>a hundred pounds</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>of a mixture of myrrh and aloes to be applied on Jesus’</p>
<p>body before his burial (19:39). is large amount of spices suggests that </p>
<p>Jesus was given a royal burial (cf. 2 Chr 16:14; Jer 34:5; Ant. 17.8.3), con-</p>
<p>rming Pilate’s writing on the cross that Jesus is the King.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>is suggests</p>
<p>that Nicodemus believed that Jesus is the coming King aer he heard Jesus’ </p>
<p>teaching on the kingdom of God. Mary anointed Jesus six days before the </p>
<p>Passover, marking the day of Jesus’ burial as King (12:3, 7), whereas Joseph </p>
<p>and Nicodemus did so on the day of burial.</p>
<p>Both Joseph and Nicodemus bound Jesus’ body in linen cloths (cf. </p>
<p>20:6–7) with spices. e narrator explains, for the sake of Gentile readers, </p>
<p>that this was the burial custom of the Jews (19:40). e powdered myrrh </p>
<p>and aloes were spread between the linen cloths, while the spices and aro-</p>
<p>matic oils were applied to the body. Jesus’ face must have been bound over </p>
<p>the head by a napkin (cf. 20:7). In the place of Jesus’ crucixion, Golgotha, </p>
<p>there was a garden and a new tomb, where no one had ever been laid, was </p>
<p>situated in the garden (19:41). e tomb was at hand and so they laid Jesus </p>
<p>there. As the day of preparation for the Passover was about to end, they had </p>
<p>to bury Jesus’ body quickly in the nearby tomb (19:42). It was also a day of </p>
<p>preparation for the disciples to see the risen Jesus!</p>
<p>e fact that Jesus was buried in a garden again exhibits him as the </p>
<p>King of the Jews. e tomb belonged to Joseph of Arimathea (Matt 27:57, </p>
<p>60). is may fulll Isa 53:9, which predicted that the Lord’s Servant was </p>
<p>with a rich man in his death. e newness of the tomb reminds us of the </p>
<p>newness of the young donkey on which Jesus rode as King (12:14–15; Mark </p>
<p>11:2, 10; Luke 19:30, 38). Undoubtedly, John pictures Jesus as King in his </p>
<p>exaltation on the cross, whence he reigns, and his burial conrms it. e </p>
