<p>Jesus’ Self-Revelation as the Life-Giving Bread</p>

<p>fullls the role of God. However, he admonishes his audience by saying, </p>
<p>“You have seen me, but do not believe” (6:36). ey should have perceived </p>
<p>Jesus as God’s self-revelation in his signs, but they failed to see due to their </p>
<p>anity with earthly things. Even aer they saw the sign of feeding the mul-</p>
<p>titude, they did not believe and receive him. eir unbelief is reected in </p>
<p>their murmuring and disputing among themselves (6:41, 42, 52). </p>
<p>All whom the Father has given to the Son will come to him and the </p>
<p>Son will not cast them out (6:37; cf. 6:39; 10:29; 17:2, 6; 18:9), because what </p>
<p>the Father does he also does (5:17, 19–21). Jesus highlights the Father’s </p>
<p>initiative to bring people to him (cf. 6:44, 65). Does it mean that God has </p>
<p>predestined some to be given to Jesus and others not to? 6:37 shows not </p>
<p>so much God’s predestination as the co-operation between the Father and </p>
<p>the Son: God takes the initiative to enable people to believe in and come </p>
<p>to Jesus and the Son fully accepts them. God, who has a universal vision </p>
<p>(3:16–17), cannot be selective in admitting them into his community. It is </p>
<p>the hearers who should decide on God’s oer of eternal life in Jesus.</p>
<p>Such initiative act of God also proves that the Son has come down </p>
<p>from heaven to do the will of the Father rather than his own will (6:38; cf. </p>
<p>4:34; 5:30). e will of the Father is that not even one person whom God </p>
<p>gave to Jesus should perish eternally, but that Jesus should raise them up at </p>
<p>the last day (6:39; cf. 5:28–29). e neuter singular “it” (“raise it up”) refers </p>
<p>to the community of those who believed in Jesus by the work of God within </p>
<p>them. “e last day” indicates the time of nal judgment of God, when he </p>
<p>will render to people according to their deeds (John 12:48; cf. 5:28–29; Rom </p>
<p>2:6–11; “the day of Yahweh” in Amos 5:18–20; “that day” in Isa 2:11, 17, 20; </p>
<p>1 En. 45:3–6). e statement “everyone whom he has given to me” (6:39) is </p>
<p>interpreted in 6:40 as “everyone who sees the Son and believes in him,” and </p>
<p>“that I may lose nothing of all that he has given me” is interpreted as “that </p>
<p>the one (who is raised up) may have eternal life.” ose who perceive God’s </p>
<p>glory in the Son and believe in him will enjoy life with God and Jesus will </p>
<p>raise them up at the end-time.</p>
<p>e Galilean Jews became indignant on Jesus’ assertion of his heav-</p>
<p>enly origin and therefore murmured at him (6:41). ey, who eagerly went </p>
<p>to Capernaum to see Jesus, are now called “the Jews.” In their murmur-</p>
<p>ing, which shows their unbelief in Jesus and rejection of his teaching, they </p>
<p>resemble the Jewish authorities. ey reect the same character of their </p>
<p>forefathers in the wilderness who became rebellious and murmured against </p>
<p>Moses (Exod 16:2, 7–12; cf. Exod 15:24; 17:3; Num 11:1; 14:2, 27). is </p>
