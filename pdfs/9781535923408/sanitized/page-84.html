<p>Holistic Healing Given to a Sick</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>becomes liable to severe punishment and his guilt remains (cf. 9:41). us, </p>
<p>Jesus oered the man not only physical healing, but also spiritual welfare.</p>
<p>e man’s proclamation of Jesus to “the Jews” (5:15) is oen inter-</p>
<p>preted as an act of betrayal</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>or as his decision to remain in the old world</p>
<p>by joining the enemies of Jesus.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>However, the man could have gone to “the</p>
<p>Jews” out of his reverence for them and also out of his excitement of having </p>
<p>found out the healer. He testied to the love and power of Jesus before the </p>
<p>authorities. Otherwise, Jesus’ holistic healing and the healed man’s partici-</p>
<p>pation in temple worship would be meaningless.</p>
<p>Since Jesus did such signs on the Sabbath, “the Jews” continued per-</p>
<p>secuting him (5:16). Each sign Jesus did was taking him towards the cross </p>
<p>through the resultant conict between him and the authorities. When “the </p>
<p>Jews” raised the issue of having healed on the Sabbath, Jesus answered, </p>
<p>“My Father is working until now, and I also am working” (5:17). is is </p>
<p>the rst reference in John’s Gospel for Jesus’ oneness with the Father in </p>
<p>work. True, God rested from all his work of creation (Gen 2:2–3), but this </p>
<p>does not mean that he stopped his work of sustaining his creatures (cf. Ps </p>
<p>121:4, 7–8). Referring to the Sabbath, Philo denies that God ever ceased his </p>
<p>creative activity (Leg. 1.5–6; Cher. 87–90). e rabbis believed that because </p>
<p>God lls heaven and earth (Jer 23:24) he can do as he wills in the world </p>
<p>without breaking the Sabbath law. God is working to give life to people and </p>
<p>therefore Jesus, who shares in God’s life, cannot stop working to give life to </p>
<p>the sick and suering. </p>
<p>Jesus had addressed God earlier as “my Father” (2:16). He now ad-</p>
<p>dresses him again as “my Father,” which, for devout Jews, is a blasphemy, </p>
<p>for it makes him to be the Son of God and Messiah,</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>claiming thus equality</p>
<p>with God. Such a blasphemy deserved the death penalty (19:7). Jesus’ work </p>
<p>on the Sabbath and his claim to be God’s Son kindled the anger of “the </p>
<p>Jews” and they sought to kill him (5:17–18). John gives the rst reference to </p>
<p>Jesus’ death by the hands of “the Jews.”</p>
<p>The Son’s authority to give life and to judge (5:19–30)</p>
<p>e word “therefore” (oun in Greek) in 5:19 links 5:19–47 with 5:17–18. </p>
<p>Jesus’ defense begins in 5:19 with the “truly, truly, I say to you” formula. </p>
