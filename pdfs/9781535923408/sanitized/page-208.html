<p>unveil his identity as King. e reference to Jesus’ mission occurs twice in </p>
<p>Jesus’ statements: “For this I have been born,” and “For this I have come into </p>
<p>the world” (18:37b). e phrase “for this” refers to Jesus’ task of establishing </p>
<p>his kingship and to the manner in which he will establish his kingship, that </p>
<p>is, by bearing witness to the truth. </p>
<p>“Bearing witness” and “truth” are two important themes in John. </p>
<p>While “bearing witness” indicates Jesus’ proclamation of his self-identity </p>
<p>(5:31–38; 8:13–18; cf. 1:6–8), “truth” means God’s faithfulness to his cov-</p>
<p>enant to reveal his glory to humans and relate with them (1:14). Jesus was </p>
<p>born in the world to establish his kingship by testifying to what he had </p>
<p>seen and heard from the Father (3:32–33) and by revealing God’s glory in </p>
<p>terms of his love and faithful relationship with human beings. However, </p>
<p>only those who choose to live in the realm of truth (those who are of the </p>
<p>truth) will hear his voice (18:37c). ey are known as Jesus’ sheep (10:3, 16, </p>
<p>27) who obey his voice and follow him.</p>
<p>Now Pilate is challenged to decide for himself as to whether or not he </p>
<p>belongs to the truth to hear Jesus’ voice.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>It is not Jesus who is on trial, but</p>
<p>Pilate, who is confronted with the “Light of the world” to decide whether </p>
<p>he is on the side of darkness or light.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>With this challenge, Pilate asks Jesus,</p>
<p>“What is truth?” (18:38a). e irony here is that although Pilate had the </p>
<p>embodiment of truth standing before him and was interacting with the </p>
<p>truth, he could not experience truth due to his unbelief in Jesus.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Aer</p>
<p>raising the question, he did not wait to listen to the voice of truth, but went </p>
<p>out to “the Jews” again to tell them that he found no crime in Jesus (18:38b). </p>
<p>Pilate, aer his interrogation, did not nd Jesus a criminal who has a po-</p>
<p>litical agenda (cf. 19:4, 6) and therefore he was willing to release him. He </p>
<p>mentions that the Jews have the custom that the governor should release </p>
<p>a prisoner for them at the Passover and asks the crowd whether he can </p>
<p>release for them the King of the Jews (18:39).</p>
<p>ere is no convincing reference to the Jewish custom of getting a </p>
<p>prisoner released by the governor anywhere outside the Gospel narratives. </p>
<p>However, the Mishna speaks of a person whom the Roman authorities </p>
<p>promised to bring out of prison at the Passover, implicitly at the request of </p>
<p>the Jews (m. Pesah. 8:6). is rabbinic reference suggests that the release of </p>
