<p>Jesus’ Prayer for His Expanding Community</p>
<p>170</p>
<p>speaks for Jesus’ heavenly origin, his descent to earth by incarnation, and </p>
<p>his departure to the Father through crucixion and resurrection. </p>
<p>Jesus submits that he made God’s name known to his disciples (cf. </p>
<p>17:6), and he vows that he will continue to make it known until and even </p>
<p>aer he departs from the world (17:26a). e purpose of revealing God’s </p>
<p>name is that God’s love with which he loved Jesus may be in the community </p>
<p>of believers and that Jesus may be in them (17:26b). is recalls 15:9: “As </p>
<p>my Father loved me, I also have loved you; remain in my love.” e three-</p>
<p>fold relationship of love between the Father, the Son, and their community </p>
<p>(17:23) is reiterated in nal words of Jesus’ prayer.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons </p>
<p>Prayer is the crown of Jesus’ Pastoral Speech and the nerve of life in God’s </p>
<p>community. Jesus often exhorted his disciples to ask the Father in his name </p>
<p>so that they may receive (14:13–14; 15:7, 16; 16:23–24). He himself dem-</p>
<p>onstrated the power of prayer (6:11; 11:41–42). Therefore organizing com-</p>
munal and individual prayers in churches is as much necessary as worship.
<p>Today’s Baptist church originated from a prayer meeting held in a small house </p>
<p>in Zurich, and an active mission organization in India, Friends Missionary </p>
<p>Prayer Band, found its root in prayer. </p>
<p>My mother opened our house in 1962 for women’s prayer fellowship on </p>
<p>the initiation of the wife of our pastor. The fellowship grew and many more </p>
<p>came for prayer. In course of time, men too joined. It became a prayer meeting </p>
<p>in which the worshippers used to sing, bear witness, preach, and pray. This </p>
<p>prayer fellowship began to attract some people from Hindu faith to attend the </p>
<p>meetings. By the Word of God that was preached and through counseling, the </p>
<p>Spirit worked in the hearts of many Hindus who ultimately became Christians </p>
<p>and received baptism in the Church of South India. Each year about ﬁfteen </p>
<p>people from all sections of the society were added to the church and even now </p>
<p>they are remaining in God’s grace and Christian faith. It was a small beginning </p>
<p>as a home church in which prayer attained importance to make God’s new </p>
<p>community grow!</p>
<p>Believers’ unity with one another and with God in Jesus has a key place </p>
<p>in Jesus’ prayer. Though unity in the church does not mean uniformity, the </p>
<p>oneness that can be exhibited by people from various backgrounds and with </p>
<p>various gifts (Eph 4:1–7) is powerful enough to make the world believe that </p>
