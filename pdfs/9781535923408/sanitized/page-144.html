<p>Raising of Lazarus from the Dead</p>

<p>in the Light and do good works while the Light is with them for a little </p>
<p>while (12:35–36), lest they miss God’s way and purpose.</p>
<p>Jesus enigmatically states that Lazarus, “our friend,” has fallen asleep </p>
<p>and that he goes to awake him (11:11). “To fall asleep” was used in Ju-</p>
<p>daism and in Christian circles as a euphemism for death (1 Cor 15:6; 1 </p>
<p>ess 4:14–16). e narrator claries that Jesus means that Lazarus is dead </p>
<p>(11:13a). However, his disciples tell Jesus that Lazarus would be restored </p>
<p>if he had fallen asleep, thinking that Jesus meant Lazarus’ physical sleep </p>
<p>(11:12–13). Now Jesus himself claries that Lazarus is dead (11:14). Jesus </p>
<p>expresses his gladness for not having been in Bethany for the sake of his </p>
<p>disciples, for Lazarus’ death will enable the disciples to see God’s glory in </p>
<p>Jesus and to believe in him as the giver of life (11:4, 15). us saying, he </p>
<p>exhorts them to go to Lazarus (11:15). omas, who was called Didymos, a </p>
<p>nickname for a twin,</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>invites his codisciples to go with Jesus to die with him</p>
<p>(11:16; 14:5). omas unconsciously predicts Jesus’ death in Judea without, </p>
<p>however, grasping its redemptive signicance. He also unconsciously pre-</p>
<p>dicts that all the twelve disciples would eventually die as martyrs for Jesus.</p>
<p>Martha’s confession of Jesus as the Christ (11:17–27) </p>
<p>In 11:17, the scene shis to Bethany of Judea, two miles away from Jeru-</p>
<p>salem in the southeast, on the way to Jericho (11:18). From now on, Jesus </p>
<p>becomes the focus in this chapter, without any reference to his disciples. </p>
<p>When Jesus arrives there, he nds Lazarus having been in the tomb for four </p>
<p>days, a length of time by which, as per Jewish belief, the soul would have </p>
<p>le the body and the body would have fully decayed, making it impossible </p>
<p>to recognize the person.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>e reference to the decay of Lazarus’ body is to</p>
<p>prepare the readers to perceive the glorious power of God.</p>
<p>Many Judeans were consoling Martha and Mary over Lazarus’ death </p>
<p>(11:19). At this time, Martha hears that Jesus was coming. Immediately she </p>
<p>went out and met him (11:20) while he was still outside the village (11:30). </p>
<p>Mary was sitting in the house mourning (cf. Job 2:8, 13; Ezek 8:14). Mar-</p>
<p>tha’s act shows the family’s faith in and love for Jesus. Her statement of </p>
<p>anguish, “Lord, if you were here, my brother would not have died” (11:21), </p>
<p>shows her preliminary faith in the lordship of Jesus. However, her convic-</p>
<p>tion that “even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give </p>
