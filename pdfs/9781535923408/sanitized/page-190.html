<p>Joy and Peace aer Tribulation</p>
<p>162</p>
<p>e turning of sorrow into joy is compared to the turning of the pain </p>
<p>of a woman in labor into joy at the birth of her child (16:21). A woman un-</p>
<p>dergoes travail, anguish, and sorrow at the hour when she has to deliver a </p>
<p>child. However, aer she delivers, she forgets her anguish because of the joy </p>
<p>that a child is born in the world. e link between the statement “because </p>
<p>her hour came” and her sorrow is deliberate. It denotes metaphorically the </p>
<p>hour of Jesus’ death on the cross, which will be a time of sorrow and grief </p>
<p>to his dear ones. However, just like the sorrow of the woman in travail is </p>
<p>turned into joy at the genesis of a new life, so also Jesus’ death on the cross </p>
<p>will turn into heartfelt joy for his disciples when Jesus sees them again and </p>
<p>gives them new life (cf. Isa 26:16–19; 66:7–14). No one can take away their </p>
<p>exuberant joy by persecution or hatred (16:22). It is possible that Jesus will </p>
<p>see them in three stages: at his appearances soon aer his resurrection, at </p>
<p>his coming back as the Holy Spirit (20:22), and at his second coming to take </p>
<p>them to the Father’s house (14:1–3).</p>
<p>Jesus predicts that in the day of their joy of seeing Jesus again, his </p>
<p>disciples will not ask him anything (16:23a). In 16:23–24 the verb “to </p>
<p>ask” occurs four times, but in 16:23a the Greek word erōtaō is used. is </p>
<p>word could mean either “to ask a question” (cf. 16:5, 19, 30) or “to ask for” </p>
<p>something (cf. 16:26b). e former meaning will imply that as Jesus speaks </p>
<p>plainly now (16:25) and as the disciples’ hearts rejoice on seeing Jesus, there </p>
<p>is no need for them to question him any more.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>e latter meaning occurs</p>
<p>in 16:23b–24 by the Greek word aiteō, which refers to the disciples asking </p>
<p>the Father for anything. Jesus solemnly arms (“truly, truly, I say to you”) </p>
<p>that whatever they ask the Father will give it to them in Jesus’ authoritative </p>
<p>name.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> e context in 16:23–24 demands the meaning “to ask for” some-</p>
<p>thing for both the Greek verbs.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Until the point of Jesus’ death and resurrection they had asked noth-</p>
<p>ing in Jesus’ name, because Jesus was with them and he prayed for them on </p>
<p>several occasions (e.g., John 17). Now he promises, “Ask, and you will re-</p>
<p>ceive” (cf. Matt 7:7–11; Luke 11:9–13). e disciples’ communication with </p>
<p>and access to the Father by virtue of what Jesus did on the cross will enable </p>
<p>them to have their joy complete (16:24; cf. 15:11). e phrase “in my name” </p>
<p>6. Lincoln 2006: 424–25; Ridderbos 1997: 539 n. 190.</p>
<p>7. John 14:14 implies that prayers need to be oered to Jesus who will do what is </p>
<p>asked. Since Jesus’ works are the Father’s works, there is no contradiction between 16:23 </p>
<p>and 14:14.</p>
