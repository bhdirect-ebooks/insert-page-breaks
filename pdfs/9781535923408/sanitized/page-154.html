<p>Revolutionary Entry of Jesus into Jerusalem</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>the King of the Jews is coming in humility to deliver Israel and bring peace </p>
<p>to the whole earth.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Jesus’ disciples could not understand at rst that his riding on an ass </p>
<p>was the fulllment of the OT prophecy. But aer Jesus was gloried on the </p>
<p>cross, they remembered the humble nature of Jesus’ kingship and what the </p>
<p>pilgrims had done to him as already written in Scripture (12:16; cf. 2:22; </p>
<p>4:33–34; 11:11–16). e disciples’ remembrance could be due to the com-</p>
<p>ing of the Holy Spirit (7:39; 16:7), who will remind them of all that Jesus </p>
<p>had told them (14:26).</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Some in the crowd who went to greet Jesus had</p>
<p>been with Jesus when he raised Lazarus. ese people bore witness to what </p>
<p>they had seen and heard (12:17). Obviously this crowd believed in Jesus </p>
<p>aer seeing the sign, for in John’s Gospel bearing witness is always done by </p>
<p>those who believe in Jesus (1:7–8, 15; 5:31–37). Some people went to meet </p>
<p>Jesus because they heard of Jesus’ sign (12:18).</p>
<p>Bewildered by the mass following aer Jesus, the Pharisees were un-</p>
<p>able to do anything to Jesus in spite of their public arrest warrant (11:57). </p>
<p>ey said to one another, “You see that you accomplish nothing; look, the </p>
<p>world went aer him” (12:19). e term “world” is an exaggerated word for </p>
<p>“many” (cf. 11:48). It conveys the universal eect of the life and ministry of </p>
<p>Jesus. eir words could be an unconscious prophecy that in future many </p>
<p>more will believe and join God’s community of believers. Jesus’ entry into </p>
<p>Jerusalem was revolutionary because the King of Israel was riding on an ass </p>
<p>and his entry shook the hearts of religious leadership with a sense of defeat.</p>
<p>Coming of the Greeks to Jesus (12:20–36) </p>
<p>Dying for oneself (12:20–26) </p>
<p>ere were some Greeks who had gone up to Jerusalem to worship at the </p>
<p>Passover feast (12:20). ese Greeks are not the Greek-speaking Jews.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ese devout Greeks might be “God-fearers,” who liked Judaism because of </p>
<p>its monotheism and strong ethical teachings but who would not accept cir-</p>
<p>cumcision and break with their families (Acts 10:1–2; 13:16; 17:4; cf. Acts </p>
<p>10. Barrett 1978: 419; Kanagaraj 2005: 396–97.</p>
<p>11. e Jesus tradition in the Gospels is the result of the disciples’ remembrance of </p>
<p>what Jesus said and did and of their sharing among themselves aer the resurrection; </p>
