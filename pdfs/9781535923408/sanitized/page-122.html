<p>Jesus’ Verbal Attack on the Hostile Jews</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>Some commentators take 8:33 onwards as Jesus’ rebuke against the </p>
<p>believing Jews.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> However, it is impossible to imagine that those who re-</p>
<p>ceived Jesus’ exhortation (8:31–32) came immediately under a serious at-</p>
<p>tack by Jesus, who himself said that those who hear his words and believe </p>
<p>in the one who sent him do not come under condemnation (5:24). It seems </p>
<p>probable that in 8:33–47 Jesus addresses the hostile Jews, who constituted </p>
<p>a major part of the audience. As Jesus’ teaching took place in the temple </p>
<p>(8:20, 59), the audience could have been a mixed group.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> e unbeliev-</p>
<p>ing Jews, including the Jewish authorities, understood Jesus’ teaching on </p>
<p>freedom in earthly terms. Forgetting the bondage in which their forefathers </p>
<p>were in Egypt and in Babylon, and the Roman yoke under which they were </p>
<p>living, they proudly claimed that they, who are descendants of Abraham, </p>
<p>have never been in bondage to anyone (8:33). ey were also ignorant that </p>
<p>those who believe in Jesus are the real descendants of Abraham (Gal 3:6–7). </p>
<p>Naturally they asked Jesus, “How do you say that you will be made free?”</p>
<p>In response, Jesus solemnly armed the heavenly truth, by using the </p>
<p>expression “truly, truly, I say to you,” that every one who commits sin is a </p>
<p>slave to sin (8:34). For Jesus all are slaves to their selsh nature. Freedom </p>
<p>from egoism cannot be attained by one’s own eorts, but it is a gi of God </p>
<p>given to all who believe in Jesus, whom the Father sent to remove human </p>
<p>sin (John 1:29, 36; cf. Rom 6:16–23). Jesus claried it further in a parabolic </p>
<p>form: a slave does not have a permanent place in the family, but a son, by </p>
<p>virtue of his birth, belongs to that family for ever (8:35).</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>In Jewish society,</p>
<p>to be called a “slave” was one of the worst possible insults.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Slaves could be</p>
<p>sold and so had no right to be in a household permanently. As the only Son </p>
<p>of the Father, Jesus remains in the house of God forever (14:2–3). Just as a </p>
<p>son has authority to free his slaves, Jesus has the authority to liberate those </p>
<p>who are slaves to sin and make them “children of God” (1:12). erefore </p>
<p>Jesus promised that if only the Son makes them free from sin will they </p>
<p>become truly free (8:36). </p>
<p>Jesus accepts that the Jews genetically originate from Abraham. </p>
<p>However, his accusers do not exhibit Abraham’s moral qualities such as a </p>
