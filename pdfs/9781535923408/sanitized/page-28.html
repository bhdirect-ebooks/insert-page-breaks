<p>Introduction</p>
<p>xxviii</p>
<p>believers could withstand the heresies without proper teaching. If pisteusēte </p>
<p>(“to start believing”) is read, then the primary purpose of John would be to </p>
<p>proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ to those who have not yet come to faith, </p>
<p>whether they be Jews or proselytes or Gentiles or Samaritans. He persuades </p>
<p>them to believe Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God, so that they might </p>
receive divine life through him.
<p>John’s concern for evangelizing all people becomes very obvious, for </p>
<p>example, in his use of the term “world” (kosmos)—seventy-eight times in </p>
<p>the Gospel, whereas it is used only fourteen times in the Synoptics. In the </p>
<p>prologue and in 3:16–21 the author of the Gospel shows great concern for </p>
<p>the salvation of the “world” (cf. 1:5, 9–11; 3:19–21). e universal outlook </p>
<p>is reected in the Gospel by o-repeated words such as “as many as,” “ev-</p>
<p>eryone,” “all people,” etc.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> However, proclamation would be impossible un-</p>
<p>less God’s new community becomes active by being equipped and guided </p>
<p>by the Holy Spirit to share its faith (15:26–27; 17:20–21, 23).</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>e purpose</p>
<p>of John, then, was mainly twofold: (i) to proclaim Jesus as the Christ, the </p>
<p>Son of God, to the world; and (ii) to conrm the faith of the believers who </p>
<p>will witness to Jesus in the world.</p>
<p>In course of reading this commentary, readers will understand how a </p>
<p>new community was formed around Jesus in a covenantal relationship with </p>
God and how it drew into itself a diverse range of people, including those
<p>who live in our own day (cf. 17:20). One may perceive that the community </p>
<p>envisioned by Jesus is rooted in and shaped by the cross. e new life given </p>
<p>by the risen Jesus will lead them eventually to continue his mission in the </p>
<p>world in the power of the Holy Spirit (20:21–23). e community motif </p>
<p>found in John has led many scholars to read the Gospel as “embodying the </p>
<p>history of Johannine community.”</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>However, the inclusive nature of the</p>
<p>Gospel leads us to look into John’s community as a universal and inclusive </p>
<p>movement.</p>
<p>31. Bauckham (1998: 9–48) argues that the Gospels were written for a wider circula-</p>
<p>tion rather than to a particular audience; cf. Evans 2008: 112.</p>
<p>32. Cf. Brown 2010: 180–83.</p>
<p>33. Bauckham 2007: 21; cf. Pryor 1992: 157–80; Brown 1979.</p>
