<p>JOHN 21</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>e purpose of John’s Gospel in 20:30–31 gives a betting conclusion to </p>
<p>the whole Gospel. Why then should another sign done by the risen Jesus be </p>
<p>mentioned in John 21? ere are several dierences between chapters 1–20 </p>
<p>and 21 in language, style, and themes.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>However, there are thematic links</p>
<p>between John 21 and 1–20 (e.g., the complementary relationship between </p>
<p>Peter and the beloved disciple, the identication of the beloved disciple as </p>
<p>the writer of the Gospel, reference to Nathanael, etc.). ere is no textual </p>
<p>evidence that John’s Gospel was ever published without chapter 21. Weigh-</p>
<p>ing the similarities and dissimilarities, we may infer that the nal editor </p>
<p>from the Johannine community wrote and added John 21 aer the death </p>
<p>of the Apostle John by using John’s written material for the epilogue and to </p>
<p>balance the prologue in 1:1–18.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>If the real author had added it, he would</p>
<p>have felt free to move or modify his conclusion in 20:30–31.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>is leads us to question: why was it added? Since the Gospel was </p>
<p>accepted rst in the heretical circles, John 21 might have been added with </p>
<p>a nal conclusion that is attested by the Johannine community in order to </p>
<p>get a wider acceptance of the Gospel (cf. “we know” in 21:24).</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>In the light</p>
<p>of the unique pastoral interest and the later church’s mission reected in </p>
<p>John 21, we may say that the Gospel looks beyond the horizon of Jesus’ </p>
<p>resurrection to the life and ministry of his new community. </p>
<p>The third revelation of the risen Jesus (21:1–14) </p>
<p>Aer two appearances of the resurrected Jesus to his male disciples, he </p>
<p>revealed himself again to them by the Sea of Tiberias, which is the Sea of </p>
<p>Galilee (6:1). “And he revealed like this” (21:1) looks forward to the way in </p>
<p>1. Cf. von Wahlde 2010: 2.884–88; Kanagaraj 2005: 669–71.</p>
