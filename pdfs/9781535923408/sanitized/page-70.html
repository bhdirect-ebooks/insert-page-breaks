<p>Jesus’ Self-Revelation to the Samaritan Woman</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>Abraham (8:53, 58) and logically than Jacob. e words “our father Jacob” </p>
<p>show not only the common origin of Jews and Samaritans, but also the </p>
<p>woman’s knowledge of the Pentateuch. </p>
<p>e heart of the dialogue lies in 4:13–14: “Every one who drinks of </p>
<p>this water will thirst again; but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give </p>
<p>him will never thirst, but the water that I shall give him will become in him </p>
<p>a spring of water welling up to eternal life.” e water from Jacob’s Well is </p>
<p>physical and hence will quench thirst only temporarily. But the water given </p>
<p>by Jesus, being the gi of the Holy Spirit, has a twofold function: </p>
<p>(i) It will permanently satisfy the thirst of anyone who drinks of that </p>
<p>water, for it provides everlasting existence with God to the one who </p>
<p>receives it (cf. Isa 49:10; Rev 7:16); </p>
<p>(ii) As the water given by Jesus has an outowing nature (Isa 44:3–4), it </p>
<p>will be a fountain of life within the one who receives it and will reach </p>
<p>out others to lead them to “eternal life” (cf. Ps 1:3; Ezek 47:9–12). </p>
<p>On hearing these words, the woman progresses in her understanding </p>
<p>of Jesus and addresses him as kyrie (“sir” or “master” or “teacher”; 4:15). </p>
<p>However, she misunderstands him, thinking that he is referring to the </p>
<p>earthly water that has magical power, and so she asks him for the water </p>
<p>that will never make her thirsty (cf. 6:34). Jesus immediately asks her to go </p>
<p>and bring her husband (4:16). Jesus’ command means that receiving “living </p>
<p>water,” the gi of the Spirit, will not be possible for anyone who has an-</p>
<p>ity with the things of the esh (cf. 3:5–6). erefore Jesus expects those </p>
<p>who ask for living water to acknowledge rst their life attached with earthly </p>
<p>things. Otherwise, they cannot understand the things of the Spirit. Jesus </p>
<p>seeks to help the woman to acknowledge that her lifestyle is socially and </p>
<p>morally unacceptable. e woman honestly accepts that she does not have </p>
<p>a husband. </p>
<p>Jesus rst appreciates her truthfulness, by stating, “You said well” </p>
<p>(4:17), and then unveils her past life, saying that she had had ve hus-</p>
<p>bands and that the man she is living with now is not her husband. Jesus </p>
<p>had foreknown the truth about the woman’s perverted life and therefore </p>
<p>he states, “You have said this truly” (4:18). Some argue that the woman </p>
<p>might not have been an “immoral person,” for she might have married ve </p>
husbands who all died in succession, or she might have divorced her previ-ous husbands, or they might have divorced her one by one. However, the
<p>woman’s plain statement “I have no husband,” while she had a man whom </p>
<p>she could not call her husband, makes this conjecture unacceptable. e </p>
