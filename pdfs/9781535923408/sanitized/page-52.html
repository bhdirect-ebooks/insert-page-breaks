<p>Jesus’ Public Ministry</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>both 2:1–11 and 2:13–22 Jesus transforms the Jewish legal custom to do </p>
<p>good to people by fullling their need.</p>
<p>Jesus went up to Jerusalem just before the Passover, a Jewish festival </p>
<p>celebrated every year in commemoration of God’s deliverance of the Israel-</p>
<p>ites from slavery in Egypt, having passed over their houses without killing </p>
<p>the rst-born by seeing the blood of a lamb on their lintels and doorposts </p>
<p>(Exod 12). All who went up to Jerusalem used to go to the temple to oer </p>
<p>sacrices and worship God (cf. Ps 122). Naturally Jesus, as a Jew, rst went </p>
<p>into the temple.</p>
<p>In the temple, Jesus did not see an atmosphere of worship, but a busi-</p>
<p>ness trend. He found those who were selling oxen, sheep, and pigeons, and </p>
<p>money changers sitting (2:14) for exchanging the currency brought by </p>
<p>pilgrims who came from other countries into Tyrian coinage, which was </p>
<p>the prescribed currency to pay temple dues (m. Bek. 8:7). e oxen, sheep, </p>
<p>and pigeons were required by the Law to be sacriced (Lev 1 and 3). Sur-</p>
<p>prisingly, sale of “lambs,” the actual Passover sacrice, is not mentioned in </p>
<p>the narrative. e temple authorities apparently did not give priority to the </p>
<p>sacricial lambs, but were primarily concerned with the trade that would </p>
<p>bring them economic prot. at is why Jesus became zealous for the house </p>
<p>of God and made a whip of cords to chase out the animals and to pour </p>
<p>out the coins of the money changers by overturning their tables (2:15). He </p>
<p>rebuked them by stating that they should not use “my Father’s house” for </p>
<p>the purpose of trading (John 2:16; cf. Jer 7:11 and Isa 56:7; see also Matt </p>
<p>21:13 par.).</p>
<p>e business seems to have been carried on in the “Court of the Gen-</p>
<p>tiles,” an area beyond which Gentiles were not permitted to go, into the </p>
<p>forecourts and the sanctuary, lest they face the death penalty. e ongo-</p>
<p>ing business and prot making consequently prevented the Gentiles from </p>
<p>entry into the temple to pray and worship,</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>although the temple was to be</p>
<p>the house of prayer for “all nations” (Mark 11:17). John’s phrase “a house of </p>
<p>trade” alludes to Zech 14:21, where it appears in the context of Zechariah’s </p>
<p>prophecy about coming of the non-Jews into the temple to worship Yahweh </p>
<p>the King (Zech 14:16–17). us, one of the reasons, if not the sole reason,</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p>for Jesus’ vehement action was the preventing of Gentiles by the Jewish </p>
<p>authorities from entering the court by making it a commercial place.</p>
