<p>Coming of the Greeks to Jesus</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>the Greeks is this: “Seeing Jesus,” as an act of worship, demands the cost of </p>
<p>their own lives, and it involves serving Jesus and following his life pattern.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>e liing-up of the Son of Man (12:27–36) </p>
<p>In the coming of the Greeks to him, Jesus sees his fast-approaching death. </p>
erefore he divulges his inner struggle by saying, “Now my soul is trou-
<p>bled. And what would I say, ‘Father, save me from this hour?’” (12:27; cf. </p>
<p>Matt 26:38; Mark 14:34). e implied answer is “no.” He immediately af-</p>
<p>rms, “But on account of this I came to this hour.” He realizes that since the </p>
<p>“hour” of the Father for his crucixion has come (12:23), he cannot avoid </p>
<p>it. He prays to the Father to glorify his name through his death (12:28a). </p>
<p>When the Son is exalted on the cross, he reveals the Father’s love and life-</p>
<p>giving power to humanity and thus the Father is gloried (13:31–32; 17:1, </p>
<p>4–5).</p>
<p>While Jesus was praying, a voice came from heaven, “I gloried and </p>
<p>again I will glorify it” (12:28b; cf. Mark 1:11; 9:7). e double promise as-</p>
<p>sures that God has gloried his name throughout the life and ministry of </p>
<p>Jesus (2:11; 11:4, 40) and that he will glorify it in his death and resurrec-</p>
<p>tion. Without recognizing the voice as God’s voice, some of the bystanders </p>
<p>said that it was a thunder. Others thought that an angel had spoken to him </p>
<p>probably to strengthen him in his trouble (12:29). But Jesus explained that </p>
<p>the voice came not for his benet but for theirs (12:30). He does not need </p>
<p>heavenly help to keep his faith and strengthen him, but the crowd needed </p>
<p>to know that the Father is at work in the Son</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> and that in the Son’s self-</p>
<p>sacrice on the cross the Father is gloried.</p>
<p>e twice-repeated “now” in 12:31 indicates the hour of Jesus’ death, </p>
<p>which has already dawned (cf. 12:27, 33). It has brought judgment of this </p>
<p>world and the overthrow of the “ruler of this world.” “is world,” the sphere </p>
<p>of human aairs, is under evil (1 John 5:19). e people of this world, be-</p>
<p>cause of their unbelief and love for darkness (3:19), reject Jesus and his </p>
<p>followers (15:18–25; 17:14–16) and thus put themselves under God’s judg-</p>
<p>ment (3:18–21), which is both present and future (5:25, 27–29, 12:48).</p>
<p>e “ruler of this world” confronts Jesus (14:30; 16:11), because he </p>
<p>is the evil one (1 John 2:13–14; 3:12; 5:18), the devil (6:70; 8:44; 13:2) and </p>
<p>14. Cf. Kanagaraj 2005: 404.</p>
