<p>JOHN 1</p>
<p>The Origin of Jesus and of the New Community</p>
<p>Prologue (1:1–18)</p>
<p>e Gospel of John commences with the prologue (1:1–18), which, by vir-</p>
<p>tue of major themes it covers, is called the “window” through which the </p>
<p>whole Gospel may be read.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>e structure of the prologue betrays a Jewish</p>
<p>poem or hymn rather than “rhythmical prose” with at least six strophes </p>
<p>(1:1–3, 3–5, 10–11, 12–13, 14–16, 17–18), with the author’s insertion of </p>
<p>verses 6–8 and 15.</p>

<p>e prologue serves as a “poetic preamble” to John’s</p>
<p>Gospel, composed by the author himself, perhaps by using the hymn on </p>

<p>Pre-Existence of Christ as the Word (1:1–5)</p>
<p>John’s opening statement, “In the beginning was the Word,” takes us not </p>
<p>only to the existence of the Word (logos in Greek) before creation, but also </p>
<p>sets God’s redemptive work in the context of the eternal existence of the </p>
<p>Logos. e phrase “in the beginning,” unlike that in Genesis 1:1, speaks </p>
<p>of the time before the genesis (cf. Prov 8:23). e word Logos here is a title </p>
<p>used in an absolute sense.</p>
<p>By referring to the Logos, John uses a term that was familiar to all </p>
<p>sections of the society in the rst century CE (see the excursus below). e </p>
<p>Logos was in existence as a personal being and the sphere of his existence </p>
<p>was God himself, as the assertion “the Logos was with God” (1:1b) shows. </p>
<p>e phrase “with God” does not have the sense of “motion towards God” </p>
<p>but the sense of “being from God” (6:46) or “living in communion with </p>
<p>God.” at is, the Logos was living so close to God that he was sharing in </p>
