<p>membership. Sometimes, by their cold attitude shown to visitors, they convey </p>
<p>the message that their respective churches belong to them only. In some </p>
<p>churches, those who do not belong to their community are allowed to worship </p>
<p>with them, but they do not get full membership in the church. This means </p>
<p>that the non-members cannot be part of any decision-making body. Moreover, </p>
<p>they are not given the right to vote in church elections. Some churches that </p>
<p>are dominated by one particular caste treat Christians from other castes only </p>
<p>as sources of income to the church without giving them equal participation in </p>
<p>worship, church work, and employment.</p>
<p>The main reason for such cold treatment is the fear of the dominating </p>
<p>community that its members may lose membership in church councils and </p>
<p>thus their identity. One caste prevents the other caste group from superseding </p>
<p>it by using their spiritual gifts and skills in the ministry of the church. Fear of </p>
<p>oppression and humiliation often grips the new covenant community to the </p>
<p>extent that they do not include people from other cultures or ethnic groups. </p>
<p>Thus social, political, and communal factors drive the body of Christ into in-</p>
<p>security and exclusivism. They practice discrimination without a global vision </p>
<p>to perceive the inclusive nature of God’s new community.</p>
<p>The exclusive attitude of the Christian community has been overcome </p>
<p>in the past by the ﬁrm action taken by pastors and other Christian leaders. </p>
<p>They built up good rapport with the majority group and then taught them to </p>
<p>include other sheep into the fold. Many churches today arrange for a picnic </p>
<p>or excursion or retreat or recreation or Bible study for all the parishioners </p>
<p>so that people from one community may intimately relate with people from </p>
<p>another. The leaders may keep the church focused on the mission of bringing </p>
<p>others into Jesus’ community to promote the spirit of love and unity, just like </p>
<p>Jesus kept the Samaritan woman involved in bringing her people to him and </p>
<p>exhorted his disciples to reap the harvest at the present time. It is the collec-</p>
<p>tive and active participation in the outﬂowing ministry of the church that will </p>
<p>make both the sower and the reaper rejoice together and accept each other.</p>
<p>By recording Jesus’ positive attitude to the Jews and to the outcasts, </p>
<p>John conveys that the church, as a multiethnic community, should accept all </p>
<p>sections of people without any discrimination and encourage them to use their </p>
<p>gifts and talents for building the church up (cf. Eph 3:3–6).</p>
