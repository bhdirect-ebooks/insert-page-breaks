<p>Foundation of the Community of Faith</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>eir joy and new knowledge of Scripture inspired the two disciples </p>
<p>to tell others that they found the Messiah.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>Andrew shares this good news</p>
<p>rst to his brother Simon (1:41), who was inspired to see Jesus. erefore </p>
<p>Andrew brought him to Jesus to be a part of Jesus’ community. With the </p>
<p>Baptist as the origin, the two disciples became the pioneers of Christ’s com-</p>
<p>munity, the church.</p>
<p>e Greek word emblepsas (“having looked at”) in 1:42 implies Jesus’ </p>
<p>deep insight and inner perception into the life of Simon. Jesus had already </p>
<p>known Peter by the name “Simon” and his father, John, for he foreknew </p>
<p>each human being by name, background, and future destination (1:48; </p>
<p>2:24–25; 4:16–18; 13:38; 20:25, 27; 21:6). Simon will be called “Cephas” </p>
<p>(petros in Greek), meaning “rock,” because at his meeting with Jesus, Simon </p>
<p>must have perceived him as the Christ. By changing his name, Jesus hints </p>
<p>at a change in Peter’s life and ministry thereaer. </p>
<p>Jesus takes the initiative (“Jesus decided”) to shi the place of his </p>
<p>ministry from the eastern side of Jordan to the western side of the Sea of </p>
<p>Galilee, where he nds Philip of Bethsaida (cf. 12:21), a disciple who attains </p>
<p>importance in John’s Gospel (12:21–22; 14:8–9). Bethsaida is mentioned </p>
<p>as the “city of Andrew and Peter” (1:44), whereas according to the Synop-</p>
<p>tic Gospels Andrew and Peter came from Capernaum (Matt 8:5, 14; Mark </p>
<p>1:21, 29; Luke 4:31, 38). However, both Bethsaida and Capernaum were </p>
<p>situated in Galilee and aer 70 CE the whole region around the Sea of Gali-</p>
<p>lee was called “Galilee,”</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>and therefore John is not incorrect in mentioning</p>
<p>the native place of Philip. He is the only disciple whom Jesus commands in </p>
<p>John, “Follow me” (1:43), a command given to other disciples in the Syn-</p>
<p>optic Gospels (Matt 4:19–22; 8:22; 9:9; Mark 1:17, 20; 2:14). Philip decided </p>
<p>to follow Jesus, and this led him to identify Jesus of Nazareth as the Christ </p>
<p>to whom the Law of Moses and the OT prophets (the whole of OT) testify </p>
<p>(John 1:45). </p>
<p>Philip immediately shared his conviction with Nathanael by witness-</p>
<p>ing, “We have found him . . .” us the circle of God’s new community </p>
<p>became bigger by the addition of those who believed Jesus as the Christ </p>
<p>and bore witness to him enthusiastically. Since the foundation of this new </p>
<p>community is faith in Jesus as the Messiah, Jesus, in John, is revealed and </p>
<p>38. For the sake of Greek readers the narrator translates the Hebrew “Messiah” into </p>
<p>Greek “Christ” (cf. 1:38, 41). </p>
