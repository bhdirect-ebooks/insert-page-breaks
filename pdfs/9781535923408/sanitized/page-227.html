<p>John 20:19–23</p>
<p>199</p>
e risen Jesus gave them divine peace once again and commissioned
<p>them by saying, “As the Father has sent me, even so do I send you” (20:21; </p>
<p>cf. 17:18). ere is no dierence in meaning of the twice-repeated word </p>
<p>“sending,” though two dierent Greek words are used. Jesus’ death and res-</p>
<p>urrection built up God’s new community, which had taken shape during </p>
<p>his earthly ministry. e resurrection is to be followed by Jesus’ sending </p>
<p>of the Holy Spirit (14:26; 15:26; 16:7–11) who will work as Jesus’ presence </p>
<p>through the church in this world. Both Jesus’ mission and the church’s mis-</p>
<p>sion originate from the Father and therefore the church’s mission is actually </p>
<p>God’s mission.</p>
<p>e model and ground of the church’s mission is what Jesus did and </p>
<p>spoke in the world. e purpose of Jesus’ appearance to his disciples is not </p>
<p>only to show himself alive (cf. Acts 1:3), but to send them into the world to </p>
<p>continue the work of building up his community by witnessing to the truth </p>
<p>(18:37), by delivering the world from eternal destruction (3:16–17), and by </p>
giving divine life in abundance (10:10). Jesus’ community is sent to bring
<p>“other sheep” into his sheep-old (10:16) so that unity and love may be com-</p>
<p>municated to the world (13:34–35; 17:21). ere is no dierence between </p>
<p>God sending his Son and the Son sending his newly founded community </p>
<p>into the world.</p>
<p>e task of bearing witness to Jesus would be impossible for the church </p>
<p>without the power of the Holy Spirit (John 15:26–27; cf. Acts 1:8). erefore </p>
<p>Jesus breathed on the disciples by saying, “Receive the Holy Spirit” (20:22). </p>
<p>e use of the verb “to breathe on” is deliberate here. Breathing on them </p>
<p>alludes to Gen 2:7, where God creates humanity by breathing into Adam’s </p>
<p>nostrils the breath of life. In Ezek 37:9 God asks Ezekiel to prophesy to the </p>
<p>breath (or “wind”) to “breathe on” the slain that they may come back to life. </p>
<p>Both the passages describe the breath of God as life-giving source. How-</p>
<p>ever, Ezek 37:9–10 refers actually to the resurrection of the dead. In the </p>
<p>context of John 20:22, the most acceptable background is Gen 2:7. What </p>
<p>Yahweh did in the OT to create humanity, the gloried Jesus does to create </p>
<p>a new humanity, which has new life by Jesus’ breath.</p>
<p>e empowerment motif, along with the idea of newly created com-</p>
<p>munity, is stronger in 20:22. e community that was founded by Jesus is </p>
<p>rooted at the cross and is now empowered by the Holy Spirit to accomplish </p>
<p>God’s mission. e commissioning of Jesus for the work of the Father is </p>
<p>naturally followed by empowerment. e Spirit, then, is not any denomina-</p>
<p>tion’s possession, but is given for the common good, that is, for the growth </p>
