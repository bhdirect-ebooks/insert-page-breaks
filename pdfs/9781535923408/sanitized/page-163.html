<p>John 13:1–20</p>
<p>135</p>
<p>(18:28; 19:14, 31, 36, 42).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>It raises the question: which version gives the</p>
correct date for Jesus’ celebration of the Passover? Scholars are divided in
<p>answering. e Passover, as per the Lord’s commandment, is to begin at </p>
<p>twilight on the 14th of Nisan with the eating of unleavened bread, with the </p>
<p>feast on the 15th (Exod 12:18; Lev 23:5–6). John narrates that Jesus had the </p>
<p>“Passover meal” before the day of Passover. Historically, John is not wrong, </p>
<p>because the eating of unleavened bread begins on the evening of Nisan 14 </p>
<p>itself. It also fullls his theological purpose of merging Jesus’ crucixion </p>
<p>with the time when the priests slaughtered Passover lambs in the temple </p>
<p>(at about 3:00 p.m. on Nisan 14) and thereby he presents Jesus as the Pass-</p>
<p>over lamb whose blood was shed on the cross for human deliverance (John </p>
<p>19:36; cf. 1 Cor 5:7). </p>
<p>Before the Passover, Jesus supernaturally knew that “his hour,” the ap-</p>
<p>pointed time of the Father, had come to depart from the world (13:1a; cf. </p>
<p>12:23, 27). e verb “to depart” literally means “to ascend,” implying Jesus’ </p>
<p>ascent to the Father by crucixion.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>His disciples are termed as “his own”</p>
<p>(10:4, 14, 29; 17:6, 9, 10), which marks Jesus’ ownership on them. e verb </p>
<p>“to love” is repeated twice emphasizing Jesus’ love for his followers until </p>
<p>the end of his earthly life and beyond (13:1b). His act of love is set against </p>
<p>the act of the devil, who laid in Judas Iscariot’s heart the determination to </p>
<p>betray Jesus (13:2). ere is no reference in John that Judas betrayed Jesus </p>
<p>for the sake of money (cf. Matt 26:14–16 par.).</p>
<p>Jesus knew that the Father had given all things into his hands (cf. </p>
<p>3:35), which includes God’s authority to destroy the power of the devil. </p>
<p>He also knew that he came from God and was departing to God (13:3).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At this point, Jesus (i) rose from the meal, (ii) put o his garments, (iii) </p>
<p>took a towel, (iv) girded himself with it, (v) poured water into the basin, </p>
<p>(vi) began to wash the feet of the disciples, and (vii) wiped them with his </p>
<p>towel (13:4–5). Foot washing, in Jewish society, was considered too menial </p>
<p>a job for even a Jewish slave to undertake, appropriate only for a Gentile </p>
<p>slave and his wife and children.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Occasionally disciples would render such</p>
<p>service to their teacher as a sign of devotion.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Here Jesus takes up the form</p>
<p>of a slave (Phil 2:7) and humbles himself to serve his disciples by washing </p>
