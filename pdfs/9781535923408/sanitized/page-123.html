<p>John 8:31–47</p>

<p>modest mind, a humble heart, and compassion, as the rabbis regarded.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Instead of recognizing that the day of Christ has dawned in Jesus, which </p>
<p>Abraham himself could see and rejoice (8:56), his opponents seek to arrest </p>
<p>and kill him (7:1, 19, 25, 32; 8:20). ey neither believe in him nor receive </p>
<p>his word of salvation and therefore Jesus’ word has no place in them (8:37, </p>
<p>43). ey, who are proud of Abraham’s paternity, are attempting to kill the </p>
<p>one who did good by preaching the truth heard from God (8:39–40, 45). </p>
<p>If they were Abraham’s children, they would do what Abraham did to men </p>
<p>who conveyed the word of God (8:39; cf. Gen 18:1–19). Indeed, Jesus’ ac-</p>
<p>cusers are descended neither from Abraham nor from God (8:41–43) but </p>
<p>from the devil (8:44).</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Jesus speaks of what he has seen with his Father, but</p>
<p>his opponents do what they have heard from their father, the devil (8:38). </p>
<p>Dierent paternity is the basic cause of Jesus’ conict with “the Jews.” He </p>
<p>deliberately contrasts himself and what he has seen from “my Father” with </p>
<p>“the Jews” who have only heard from “your father.”</p>
<p>Jesus’ contrast of “my Father” and “your father” makes “the Jews” to </p>
<p>feel that they are being identied as children of fornication. So they re-</p>
<p>spond that they were not born of fornication and that they have one Father, </p>
<p>God (8:41). is could be an indirect attack on Jesus’ birth, which, Jesus’ </p>
<p>accusers thought, could have been by fornication since he lacked a biologi-</p>
<p>cal father.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>However, the opponents’ main stress is that they have God as</p>
<p>their only Father. In Jewish tradition, “fornication” was sometimes a meta-</p>
<p>phor for idolatry. If so, their defense would be that they are not unfaithful </p>
<p>idolaters (cf. Hos 1:2; 2:4–5 LXX) but that they are faithful to the one God </p>
<p>(Deut 6:4).</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>In response, Jesus argues that if God were their Father they would </p>
<p>love Jesus, who came by being sent by God rather than on his own initiative </p>
<p>(8:42). e four verbs “came forth,” “I am present,” “have come,” and “sent” </p>
<p>denote Jesus’ heavenly origin and his God-given mission to the world (3:17; </p>
<p>7:28). So speaking, Jesus attacks his accusers that they cannot even bear to </p>
<p>hear his word (8:43) because they are like their father, the devil, and they </p>
<p>are committed to fulll their father’s desires. e devil was a murderer from </p>
<p>the beginning; he does not have the truth in him and so has no association </p>
<p>with truth, and he is a liar by nature and father of lies (8:44).</p>
