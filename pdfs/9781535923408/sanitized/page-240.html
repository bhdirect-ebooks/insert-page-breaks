<p>Final Reference to Peter and the Beloved Disciple</p>
<p>212</p>
<p>corrects both the rumors in his resurrection and appearance narratives. In </p>
<p>fact, both Peter and the beloved disciple had died by the time John’s Gospel </p>
<p>was published.</p>
<p>Concluding statements (21:24–25) </p>
<p>Aer a preliminary conclusion drawn in 20:30–31 by the real author, the </p>
<p>editor axes the nal conclusion in 21:24–25. e expression “this is the </p>
<p>disciple” (21:24) looks back to 21:22–23, pointing to the disciple whom </p>
<p>Jesus loved as the one who, as an eyewitness (19:35), is bearing witness </p>
<p>about these things. “ese things” refers to the whole life and work of Jesus </p>
<p>recorded in the Gospel, including what is narrated in John 21.</p>
<p>“Bearing witness” in John has a missiological overtone, for it indicates </p>
<p>the disciples’ proclamation of who Jesus is and what he is doing for human </p>
<p>deliverance and welfare (e.g., 1:6–8, 32, 34; 15:26–27). e beloved disciple </p>
<p>has borne witness not merely by words, but also by writing the events of </p>
<p>Jesus, perhaps in a simple form. His writing was later picked up by one of </p>
<p>the leaders in Johannine community to give it the Gospel form with added </p>
<p>comments and epilogue by the editor, his fellow member in the commu-</p>
<p>nity. is explains the plural “we know” (21:24), meaning that the writing </p>
<p>and publication of the Gospel was a team eort done in stages by three </p>
<p>persons (the implied author, the real author, and the narrator/editor) on </p>
<p>behalf of Johannine community, which attests the beloved disciple’s writ-</p>
<p>ten testimony as true. e plural “we,” then, is not a rhetorical or editorial </p>
<p>“we,” but it denotes the eyewitnesses and those who believed through their </p>
<p>words (cf. 1:14, 16). By endorsing the content of John’s Gospel as “true,” the </p>
<p>community emphasizes the validity and reliability of the witness borne (cf. </p>
<p>8:14, 16) so that the Gospel may get wider acceptance.</p>
<p>e Fourth Gospel is given a nal conclusion: “But there are also </p>
<p>many other things which Jesus did, which, if written every one, I presume </p>
<p>the world itself would not aord room for the books written” (21:25). is </p>
<p>statement is essentially the same as the preliminary conclusion made in </p>
<p>20:30–31. In 20:31, the purpose of the selected signs written in the Gospel </p>
<p>is highlighted, whereas 21:25 highlights the fact that the amount of books </p>
<p>written on Jesus’ words and deeds would be more than what the whole </p>
<p>universe could contain (Post. 144; 1 Macc 9:22; Exod Rab. 30:22).</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>It seems</p>
<p>that 21:25 is missing in the rst dra of Codex Sinaiticus ()), an earlier </p>
<p>17. e “world” (kosmos) in 21:25 does not mean the sphere of human aairs or the </p>
<p>unbelievers who reject Jesus, but the total universe created by God.</p>
