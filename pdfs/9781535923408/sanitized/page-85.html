<p>John 5:19–30</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>He arms the unchangeable truth that he, as the Son of God, cannot do </p>
<p>anything by himself except what he sees the Father doing. Here is a picture </p>
<p>of an apprentice who copies what his master does.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Although it appears to</p>
<p>be a tting image, Jesus, unlike an apprentice, works always in unity with </p>
<p>the Father in such a way that their works cannot be separated from one </p>
<p>another (cf. 5:17; see 1:3 and 8:16 for the corporate work of both Father </p>
<p>and Son). Within this unity lies the Son’s subordination to and dependence </p>
<p>on the Father. e Son does not only the Father’s work of healing, but also </p>
<p>that of judging (5:22, 30). e Son’s act of giving life and rendering judg-</p>
<p>ment is done now (5:21–22, 24) and will also be exercised at the end-time </p>
<p>(5:25–29). </p>
<p>e energy behind Jesus’ acts is the Father’s love for the Son and his </p>
<p>demonstration of all his works to him (5:20). Out of his eternal love (17:24), </p>
<p>God will show greater works through Jesus than what Jesus had hitherto </p>
<p>performed so that those who see them may marvel. ese works are: rais-</p>
<p>ing the dead at the voice of the Son, and giving them life both now and in </p>
<p>future (5:21–29). Not mere works, but the very life of the Son is drawn from </p>
<p>God (5:26) and therefore he could raise the dead by his voice and give them </p>
<p>life as per his will (5:21, 25). 5:21–24 refers to two kinds of life possible </p>
for human beings: receiving divine life that is eternal, or undergoing con-
<p>demnation under the wrath of God. Anyone who hears Jesus’ message of </p>
<p>salvation and believes the Father, who sent Jesus, has already passed from </p>
the realm of natural life, which leads to eternal death, to the divine realm of
<p>life, which leads to eternal life (5:24; cf. 3:16–21). God expects them to hear </p>
<p>and obey his words spoken through Jesus and this is how can one observe </p>
<p>the Sabbath (cf. Ezek 20:11, 13).</p>
<p>Both giving life and rendering judgment are the whole prerogatives </p>
<p>of God. His purpose in entrusting those works to Jesus is that human be-</p>
<p>ings may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Anyone who does </p>
<p>not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him from heaven </p>
<p>(5:22–23), because they are one. “Honoring” means worshipping and obey-</p>
<p>ing. Jesus speaks these words to “the Jews” who worship Yahweh as the only </p>
<p>God, but reject the one sent by him. erefore 5:23a has plural subject with </p>
<p>the present tense, meaning “as they are honoring the Father.” It is impos-</p>
<p>sible to worship the one true God without worshipping and obeying Jesus.</p>
<p>e dual idea of giving life and rendering judgment is repeated in </p>
<p>5:25–29 as eschatological. All those who are in tombs will rise up from </p>
<p>11. Dodd 1968: 30–40.</p>
