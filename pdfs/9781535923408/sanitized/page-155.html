<p>ey came to Philip of Bethsaida (1:44) and said,</p>
<p>“Sir, we wish to see Jesus” (12:21). Philip, along with Andrew, told Jesus </p>
<p>(12:22). e Greeks who came to Jerusalem to worship Yahweh wished to </p>
<p>see Jesus. eologically, it implies that real worship during the Passover lies </p>
<p>in seeing Jesus, the paschal lamb.</p>
<p>At the end-time Yahweh will gather the Gentiles with the Jews to wor-</p>
<p>ship Yahweh and celebrate feast at Jerusalem, for his house is a house of </p>
<p>prayer for all nations (Isa 56:6–8; Zech 14:16–19; Mic 4:2–4). Jesus sees in </p>
<p>the coming of the Greeks the ingathering of the Gentiles with the Jews to </p>
<p>form in him a new community that will worship him, and so he answers, </p>
<p>“e hour has come that the Son of Man might be gloried” (12:23). e </p>
<p>“hour” of Jesus’ death attests to the end-time at which Jews and Gentiles </p>
<p>will be united together to worship and serve the one God revealed in Jesus. </p>
Jesus uses a parable to bring out the divine necessity for him to die and
<p>bring forth a new community. By means of the “truly, truly, I say to you” </p>
<p>formula he teaches that if a seed does not die in the soil, it cannot become </p>
<p>productive. It should give up its own life to bring forth life (12:24; cf. 2 Kgs </p>
<p>19:30). Similarly, Jesus will give up his life on the cross and will draw to </p>
<p>himself all who believe in him so that they may reect his life now and in </p>
<p>future.</p>
<p>e same principle applies to each person: those who love their life </p>
<p>will lose it and those who hate their life will keep it for eternal life (12:25). </p>
<p>is paradoxical principle brings out the cost of being a disciple to Jesus. </p>
<p>“Hating one’s life” involves dying to one’s own desires constantly. is will </p>
<p>allow Jesus to control his disciples’ lives so that they may do good deeds </p>
(2 Cor 4:10–12). ey will exhibit the divine character, which cannot be
<p>destroyed by physical death.</p>
<p>Giving up oneself to die daily will lead a person to become a servant </p>
<p>to Jesus. Jesus challenges the Greeks and his disciples that if anyone would </p>
<p>serve him, let that person follow him (12:26a; cf. 8:12). ose who would </p>
<p>serve Jesus will be where Jesus is and the Father will honor them (12:26b). </p>
<p>Jesus promised that he will come and take his followers to himself that </p>
<p>“where I am you may be also” (14:3; cf. 17:24). By taking up Jesus’ disciples </p>
<p>to be with him in the Father’s house (14:2), the Father honors them, because </p>
<p>they served him in the world by exhibiting Jesus’ lifestyle! e message to </p>
