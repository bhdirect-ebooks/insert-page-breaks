<p>e Son’s Revelation of the Father</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>as the fulllment of this prophecy.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>For him the way for true life, promised</p>
<p>by the Law, is in Jesus. He is the way that leads humankind to God, as he </p>
is embodied with truth (1:14c, 17) and divine life.

<p>rough him alone can</p>
<p>one come to God, the Father, and know him. By their intimate relation-</p>
<p>ship with Jesus his disciples have already experienced the Father. ey have </p>
<p>known him and seen him (14:7), though they themselves were not aware of </p>
<p>this truth. eir ignorance becomes visible in Philip’s appeal, “Lord, show </p>
<p>us the Father and it suces us” (14:8). is kind of non-understanding is a </p>
<p>springboard for John to explain heavenly truth.</p>
<p>Aer mildly rebuking Philip, “I have been with you so much time and </p>
<p>have you not known me, Philip?,” Jesus reveals that one who has seen him </p>
<p>has seen the Father; then he strongly rebukes, “How do you say ‘Show us </p>
<p>the Father’?” (14:9). “So much time” indicates the extent of time that Jesus </p>
<p>was with them to reveal God by his words and works and to show them </p>
<p>the unity of the Father and the Son (14:8–11).</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>e theme that the one</p>
<p>who has seen Jesus has seen God (cf. 12:44–45) is developed in 14:10–11, </p>
<p>in terms of mutual indwelling of Jesus and God. Jesus admonishes Philip </p>
<p>by questioning him, “Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the </p>
<p>Father in me?” (14:10a). Seeing God in Jesus is possible only by “believing” </p>
<p>that both Jesus and God mutually dwell within one another. Unity does not </p>
<p>mean unication of Jesus with God, but the reciprocal relationship of love </p>
<p>that exists between them.</p>
<p>Jesus speaks of his words and works in inseparable terms (14:10). He </p>
<p>does not speak on his own initiative and the corollary is that he speaks the </p>
<p>words received from God (3:34; 8:28b; 12:49). Jesus’ works are the works </p>
<p>of the Father, who dwells in oneness with him (4:34; 5:17, 19; 17:4). e </p>
<p>disciples who have experienced Jesus, then, have already seen the Father. </p>
<p>erefore Philip’s appeal “Show us the Father” is redundant. e existing </p>
<p>mutuality between the Father and the Son needs to be believed and accepted, </p>
<p>particularly by seeing his works/signs, which bear witness to the Father who </p>
<p>sent him (5:36; 10:38). In 14:8–11 “seeing” leads to the theme of mutual in-</p>
<p>dwelling of the Father and the Son, which, in turn, leads to Jesus’ persuasion </p>
<p>to believe. e content of faith is: “I am in the Father and the Father in me.”</p>
<p>Jesus uses the “truly, truly, I say to you” formula to explain the outcome </p>
<p>of “believing.” ose who continually believe in him will do the works that </p>
