<p>Jesus Walking on the Sea</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>Greek phrase literally means “on the sea” (Job 9:8; John 1:51; Rev 10:5), and </p>
<p>Weiss’ interpretation fails to explain why, then, Jesus was walking to come </p>
<p>nearer to the boat, which was “in the midst of the sea” (Mark 6:47, Greek </p>
<p>version). e same phrase is translated as “at the seashore” or “by the Sea of </p>
<p>Tiberias” (RSV, ESV) in 21:1, because the disciples were already at the shore </p>
<p>and Jesus was standing, not walking, “on the beach” (21:4).</p>
<p>When they saw Jesus walking on the sea, the disciples were frightened. </p>
<p>Jesus told them not to be frightened (6:20b). is recalls appearances of </p>
<p>God in which the witnesses are so fearful that God had to tell them not </p>
<p>to fear (Gen 15:1; 26:24; Judg 6:22–23; Isa 41:10; 43:1; cf. Matt 14:26–27; </p>
<p>Luke 1:12–13; 2:9–10; Rev 1:17). God’s appearance in Jesus is conrmed </p>
<p>by his use of the word “I, I am,” the name of the Lord (cf. 4:26). Jesus bears </p>
<p>the name of God (17:6) and reveals himself as the very presence of God </p>
<p>when his followers are at the point of death (cf. Isa 41:4; 42:6, 8; 43:10, 25; </p>
<p>45:18; 46:4; 51:10–15). Jesus’ walking on the sea portrays him as God, the </p>
<p>creator (Job 9:8; cf. 38:16), the wisdom of God (Sir 24:5–6), and the Savior </p>
<p>(Ps 77:19; Isa 43:16).</p>
<p>13</p>
e scene thus presents itself as a divine epiphany,
<p>centered on the expression “I am.”</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>e whole event is performed by Jesus at the Passover (6:4). One of </p>
<p>the scripture readings at the Passover was Isa 51:6–16,</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>which refers to</p>
<p>God’s deliverance of his people by making a way through the sea. e same </p>
<p>God makes a way on the sea to deliver Jesus’ disciples from danger. us, </p>
<p>the true meaning of the Passover is fullled in Jesus. e sign thus was not </p>
<p>mere demonstration of Jesus’ authority over nature, but more the revelation </p>
<p>of God in Jesus by the name “I am” (Isa 51:12 LXX) and his deliverance.</p>
<p>Aer seeing Jesus and hearing his comforting words, the disciples </p>
<p>“were willing to take him into the boat” (6:21). Immediately, the boat was </p>
<p>at the land to which they were going. Some scholars interpret that the boat </p>
<p>reached its destination without human eort soon aer Jesus got into the </p>
<p>boat. If so, it is a “miracle within a miracle.”</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>However, the Greek eutheōs</p>
<p>(“immediately”) does not have any miraculous connotation. It only implies </p>
<p>that the boat reached the other shore “straightway,”</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>unhindered by the</p>
<p>stormy wind and rising waves.</p>
