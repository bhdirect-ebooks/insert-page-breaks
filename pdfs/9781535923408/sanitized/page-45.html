<p>John 1:35–51</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>confessed as the Messiah in the initial stage of his ministry, whereas in </p>
other Gospels it is divulged later (Matt 16:16, 20 par.).
<p>Nathanael’s immediate question, “Can any good thing be from Naza-</p>
<p>reth?” (1:46), reects perhaps the civic rivalry between Cana, Nathanael’s </p>
<p>native place (21:2), and the neighboring Nazareth.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>Philip’s response,</p>
<p>“Come and see,” looks back to the same invitation given by Jesus to the </p>
<p>two disciples (1:39). As Nathanael was approaching Jesus, Jesus called him </p>
<p>an Israelite in whom there is no crainess, because Jesus knew his inner </p>
<p>thirst to see the Messiah (1:47), and this explains Jesus’ foreknowledge of </p>
<p>Nathanael even before Philip called him, because Jesus had seen him when </p>
<p>Nathanael was under the g tree (1:48). e statement “I saw you . . . when </p>
<p>you were under the g tree” indicates that Nathanael was looking for the </p>
<p>Messiah to come and was, therefore, meditating on the Law under the g </p>
<p>tree to search for the Messiah and his activities. Some rabbinic texts claim </p>
<p>that the more one studies the words of Law the more relish one nds in </p>
<p>them, just like the one who searches on the g tree nds more fruits on it </p>
<p>(e.g., b. Erub. 54a).</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>Nathanael’s action is in line with the Jewish rabbis</p>
<p>who studied under g trees.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>Jesus’ foreknowledge of Philip’s meeting with</p>
<p>Nathanael and of Nathanel’s expectation of the Messiah proves that Jesus </p>
was divine even while he was a human.
<p>In his rst encounter with Jesus, Nathanael confesses that Jesus is the </p>
<p>“Son of God” and the “King of Israel” (1:49). His search of the Scriptures </p>
<p>had led him to identify both titles as denoting the Messiah, who will sub-</p>
<p>due the enemies of Israel and establish his kingdom. at Christ will come </p>
<p>as King in the family of David in order to rule over Israelites with justice </p>
<p>and peace is an OT concept (Isa 11:1–5; 35:4; Zeph 3:14–17; Zech 9:9–10). </p>
<p>Christ is also portrayed as the Son begotten by God (2 Sam 7:14; Ps 2:7). </p>
<p>e messianic title “King of Israel,” in conjunction with “Son of God,” al-</p>
<p>ludes to these OT passages.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Jesus questioned Nathanael’s faith, for he had believed </p>
<p>in Jesus as the Christ only by seeing his supernatural knowledge (1:50; cf. </p>
<p>2:23–25; 12:37; 20:29). In John, believing in Jesus just by seeing his super-</p>
<p>natural deeds causes only an embryonic faith, and genuine faith comes by </p>
<p>hearing his words. Aer pointing out his faith as based on seeing, Jesus </p>
<p>gives him a promise that he will see greater things than Jesus’ supernatural </p>
