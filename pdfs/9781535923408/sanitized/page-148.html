<p>Raising of Lazarus from the Dead</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>human form. ose who believe, not those who claim to have ascended </p>
<p>to heaven, would see God’s love and saving power in Jesus’ deeds, though </p>
<p>sometimes people come to believe in Jesus aer seeing God’s love in Jesus’ </p>
<p>signs (2:11; 9:36–38; 11:45).</p>
<p>Aer they removed the stone, Jesus prays to the Father by liing up </p>
<p>his eyes, a gesture by which the Jews used to pray (John 11:41; cf. 17:1; Ps </p>
<p>121:1–2). Jesus thus shows his dependence on God and his appeal to the </p>
<p>Father to work (5:17). By calling God “Father” (cf. 12:27–28; 17:1, 5, 11, 21, </p>
<p>24), Jesus rst of all gives thanks to God (cf. 6:11, 23) by foreseeing that God </p>
<p>has already heard his prayer to bring Lazarus back to life (cf. “you heard” </p>
<p>in 11:41). Jesus knew that the Father always hears his petitions (11:42a), </p>
<p>just like the Son always does what the Father does. In the Godhead, the </p>
<p>Father and the Son mutually fulll one another’s will. Although God hears </p>
<p>his Son’s prayer always, Jesus utters a formal prayer at Lazarus’ tomb for the </p>
<p>sake of the bystanders so that they might see his sign and come to believe </p>
<p>that God sent him into the world (11:42b) to deliver those who believe in </p>
him from eternal condemnation and give them divine life (3:16–17).
<p>Aer his prayer, Jesus cries with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!” </p>
<p>(11:43). At the voice of Jesus, the dead man comes out of the tomb in the </p>
<p>same condition in which he was buried, having his hands and feet bound </p>
<p>and his face wrapped with a cloth. e Jewish manner of burial reected </p>
<p>here conrms the historical reliability of the story. Jesus’ command, “Un-</p>
<p>bind him and allow him to go” (11:44), indicates the victory of Jesus over </p>
<p>physical death and the freedom from bondage he gives to people even now. </p>
<p>Jesus’ loud voice asking the dead man to come out marks his authority to </p>
<p>raise the dead and anticipates the eschatological resurrection of the dead by </p>
<p>the same voice (5:28–29). e coming out of Lazarus from the tomb with </p>
<p>cloths unbound is dierent from Jesus’ resurrection, with his cloths le be-</p>
<p>hind in the tomb and the napkin of his head rolled up in the place by itself </p>
<p>(20:6–7), indicating Jesus’ sovereignty in his resurrection, unlike Lazarus’ </p>
<p>dependence on Jesus to be raised.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>e link between Lazarus’ death and</p>
<p>resurrection and the resolution of Jewish authorities, aer Lazarus’ resur-</p>
<p>rection, to murder Jesus shows that Lazarus’ episode pregures Jesus’ death </p>
<p>and resurrection.</p>
