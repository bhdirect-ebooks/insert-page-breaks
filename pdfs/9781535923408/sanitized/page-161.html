<p>Fusing the Horizons</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>God led me to the ministry and to places I never planned to go. I had </p>
<p>to pass through the experience of dying to my own interests often through </p>
<p>disappointments, fears, uncertainties, others’ cheating and misunderstand-</p>
<p>ing, false accusations, provocations, unexpected events, both good and bad, </p>
<p>etc. They all worked together to enable me die to myself and renew my com-</p>
<p>mitment to live for others. Previously I did not know the value of forgiveness, </p>
<p>but after having a vision of Jesus’ cross I understood what God’s forgiveness </p>
<p>means and how much I owe to forgive those who wrong me. In the course of </p>
<p>time, the cross became the source of life and refuge for me, and there is joy in </p>
<p>carrying the sufferings of Jesus so that I may be a blessing for many.</p>
