<p>John 5:1–18</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>day, including collecting sticks and bearing a burden out of one’s house, is </p>
<p>liable to the death penalty (Exod 31:14–15; Num 15:32–36; Jer 17:21–22; cf. </p>
<p>Neh 13:15–22). e concern of the OT is that people should not be engaged </p>
<p>in selsh acts on the Sabbath, but should fulll God’s will. However, this </p>
<p>meaning of Sabbath was twisted by the rabbis in strict legal terms in their </p>
<p>oral law. ey prohibited on the Sabbath the work of carrying a load from </p>
<p>one domain into another (m. Šabb. 7:2; 10:1–5; 11:1–2). Here is a reference </p>
<p>to the onerous nomism of Jewish leaders, who were supposed to seek the </p>
<p>welfare of the people. Jesus fullls the inner meaning of the Law by giving </p>
freely the divine life (Lev 18:5), which the Law could not give due to human
<p>failure to fulll the Law (cf. Rom 7). Jesus’ healing on the Sabbath exempli-</p>
<p>es the truth that God, by sending his own Son, did what the Law could not </p>
<p>do to enable people to fulll the Law (Rom 8:3–4). </p>
<p>e healed man understood Jesus only as a respectable person and </p>
<p>hence he addressed him as “sir” or “master.” He did not know him as the </p>
<p>Son of God who has the power to give life even to the dead (5:19, 21). </p>
<p>When the authorities accused the man for having broken the Law, he </p>
<p>did not testify to the marvelous way in which he was made well. Instead, </p>
<p>the narrative style of John turns to the identity of Jesus—a key feature in </p>
<p>John’s Gospel! e man testied unknowingly to Jesus by saying, “He who </p>
<p>made me well, that man said to me, ‘Take up your pallet and walk’” (5:11). </p>
<p>When the authorities enquired him who it was who said so (5:12), the man </p>
<p>answered that he did not know who it was (5:13a; cf. 9:24–27), because </p>
<p>Jesus remained withdrawn from the festival crowd (5:13b). John’s narra-</p>
<p>tive technique of presenting non-understanding in order to make a person </p>
<p>understand the identity of Jesus becomes visible. By withdrawing himself, </p>
<p>Jesus avoided not only popularity, but especially his arrest and death before </p>
<p>the “hour” of the Father. </p>
<p>Jesus later found the man in the temple (5:14a). e healed man, who </p>
<p>became a part of God’s new society, went to the temple probably to give </p>
<p>thanks to God and celebrate the feast with others whom he had probably </p>
<p>not seen for years. Jesus revealed himself in the temple as the one who </p>
<p>healed him, not only by reminding him of his total healing but also by </p>
<p>warning him not to sin any more lest worse thing happens to him (5:14b),</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p>for anyone who sins aer receiving God’s gi of healing and salvation </p>
<p>7. Not every sickness is due to human sin, but in this man’s case probably his long-</p>
<p>term illness was connected with his sin.</p>
