<p>John 19:17–30</p>
<p>187</p>
<p>presents the whole episode of Jesus’ passion and death as the fulllment </p>
<p>of OT prophecies (2:19–22; 13:18; 19:24, 28, 36–37) to prove that Jesus </p>
<p>is the Christ to whom the OT points. What all the soldiers did to Jesus </p>
<p>was within God’s plan of salvation, which they themselves did not know </p>
<p>(19:24b). eir removal of Jesus’ outer and inner garments makes it pos-</p>
<p>sible that Jesus was crucied naked, as Romans normally did for any person </p>
<p>crucied. However, in deference to the Jewish aversion to public nudity </p>
<p>Jesus would have been le with his underclothing.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>ere were three women (i.e., Jesus’ mother, her sister, who was Mary </p>
<p>the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene) standing by the cross (19:25).</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mary the wife of Clopas could be, to use the modern term, the “co-sister” of </p>
<p>Jesus’ mother, for Hegesippus (early 2nd century CE) asserted that Cleophas </p>
<p>was the brother of Joseph, the husband of Jesus’ mother.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Probably both</p>
<p>Marys were from closely related families. Unlike in the Synoptic Gospels, </p>
<p>the women in John were not standing afar, but by the cross, as the beloved </p>
<p>disciple also was. As Jesus’ mother and the beloved disciple were standing </p>
<p>nearer to each other (19:26a), Jesus could see both of them from the cross.</p>
<p>As part of his care to his mother, Jesus said to her, “Woman, behold, </p>
<p>your son!” (19:26b). He told his disciple, “Behold, your mother!” and im-</p>
<p>mediately (“from that hour”) the disciple accepted her into his care (19:27). </p>
<p>e one who loves Jesus obeys his word (14:15, 21, 23–24; 1 John 5:3; 2 </p>
<p>John 6). e love of Jesus and of the disciple was mutual. Adoptive ties held </p>
<p>signicant legal force in Roman culture and intimate friendship also could </p>
<p>make functional kinship ties.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Jesus had his own brothers (2:12), but he did</p>
<p>not entrust his mother with them, probably because they were unbeliev-</p>
<p>ers (7:5). erefore Jesus made his beloved disciple his successor as son to </p>
<p>his mother. Both the gures are nameless. Most probably, for John, Jesus’ </p>
<p>mother represents the church, God’s new community of believers, in which </p>
<p>the beloved disciple represents the witness par excellence and in which the </p>
<p>family bond is stronger than natural familial bonds.</p>
