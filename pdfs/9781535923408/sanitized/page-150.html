<p>Decision of the Jewish Council to Kill Jesus</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>dispersed Jews, the “children of God” (11:51–52). e term “the children of </p>
<p>God” in John refers widely to all those who believe in Jesus (1:12–13). e </p>
<p>statement that the benet of Jesus’ death is for all humans ironically came </p>
<p>from the mouth of someone who stood against Jesus. He unconsciously </p>
<p>acknowledged that Jesus will gather “other sheep” into his sheepfold so that </p>
<p>they may become “one ock, one shepherd” (10:7–16). </p>
<p>e council agreed to what was said by Caiaphas and took an ocial </p>
<p>resolution to kill Jesus (11:53). Since it was an ocial decision of the Jewish </p>
<p>council, Jesus was no longer ministering (literally “walking”) openly among </p>
<p>the Jews, but went away from there to Ephraim (cf. 2 Sam 13:23; 2 Chr </p>
<p>13:19), a town in the country near the wilderness lying about een miles </p>
<p>to the northeast of Jerusalem. Jesus stayed there with his disciples (11:54), </p>
<p>for the hour of the Father had not yet come for him to hand himself over </p>
<p>to “the Jews.”</p>
<p>In accordance with their decision, the chief priests and the Pharisees </p>
<p>gave orders that any one who knew where Jesus was should inform them </p>
<p>so that they might arrest him (11:57). At this time the Passover of the Jews </p>
<p>came. Many from the countryside of Judea went up to Jerusalem to purify </p>
<p>themselves (cf. Num 9:6–13; 2 Chr 30:15–19) before entering into the court </p>
<p>of the priests to sacrice the Passover lambs (11:55; cf. 18:28). e pilgrims </p>
<p>were expecting Jesus to come to Jerusalem for the Passover. Some who were </p>
<p>in the temple questioned among themselves, “What do you think? at he </p>
<p>will never come to the feast?” (11:56). Probably the people expected from </p>
<p>Jesus more signs, which on previous occasions were followed by references </p>
<p>to his death and resurrection (2:13–22; 6:4–71). eir expectation and the </p>
<p>leaders’ decision to murder Jesus foreshadow Jesus’ death and resurrection </p>
<p>in Jerusalem to stabilize God’s new community.</p>
