<p>e ird Revelation of the Risen Jesus</p>
<p>206</p>
<p>which the risen Jesus manifested himself as the Lord. John correctly num-</p>
<p>bers Jesus’ revelation here as the third one aer his resurrection (21:14), </p>
<p>keeping in mind the two appearances recorded in John 20:19–29. e shi </p>
<p>from Jesus’ revelation in Jerusalem to the Sea of Galilee is abrupt (cf. Matt </p>
<p>28:10, 16–17; Mark 16:7). Seven of the disciples, some known by their </p>
<p>names and some without their names (21:2), saw the risen Jesus. Even the </p>
<p>names of the disciples are mentioned with full details as though they are </p>
<p>being introduced rst time (e.g., “Simon Peter,” omas called the Twin, </p>
<p>Nathanael from Cana of Galilee). </p>
<p>e rst and the only reference in the Gospel to “the sons of Zebedee,” </p>
<p>who, as per the Synoptic Gospels, are James and John the Apostle, the lat-</p>
<p>ter being the most likely candidate to be called “the disciple whom Jesus </p>
<p>loved” (21:7, 20–24). e expression “two others of his disciples” shows </p>
<p>that “the other disciple” need not be taken always as the beloved disciple </p>
<p>(e.g., 18:15–16; 21:8). Papias’ list of Jesus’ disciples follows the order of the </p>
<p>disciples shown in 1:35–51 and the list in 21:2, with the only dierence </p>
<p>that Matthew’s name is mentioned, but not Nathanael’s. e “other two </p>
<p>disciples” are, in the light of Papias’ list, Aristion and John the elder who, as </p>
<p>the head of Johannine school in Ephesus, could have written John’s Gospel.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>All these disciples gathered together at the Sea of Galilee to go shing, fol-</p>
<p>lowing Simon Peter, who rst said, “I am going shing.” ey all got into </p>
<p>the boat to catch some sh, but they caught nothing throughout the night </p>
<p>(21:3; Luke 5:5). </p>
<p>When it was already early morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but, in </p>
<p>spite of his two previous appearances, the disciples did not know that it was </p>
<p>Jesus (21:4). Probably in the dim light of dawn, it was not possible for the </p>
<p>disciples to recognize the man who was standing there. e risen Jesus ap-</p>
<p>peared not in a supernatural way this time, but as an ordinary man, which </p>
<p>recalls his appearance to Mary Magdalene, who also did not perceive him </p>
<p>rst as Jesus (20:14; cf. Luke 24:15–16). Jesus takes the initiative to speak </p>
<p>and says, “Children, you do not have any catch, have you?” ey answered, </p>
<p>“No,” obviously with a sense of disappointment (21:5). e Greek word that </p>
<p>denotes a “catch [of sh]” means “a relish eaten with bread” (cf. 6:9, 11; 21: </p>
<p>9, 10, 13 for the same meaning of “sh”). Jesus’ instruction to cast their net </p>
<p>at the right side and that by so doing they caught a large quantity of sh </p>
<p>(21:6) indicate that they were still in the sea. ey were not far from the </p>
<p>5. Hist. eccl. 3.39; Hengel 1989: 16–23; see above the “Introduction”.</p>
