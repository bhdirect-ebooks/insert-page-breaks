<p>Jesus’ Prayer for His Glorication</p>
<p>166</p>
<p>“knowing,” which is essentially the same as “believing.” “e only true </p>
<p>God” refers to Yahweh (the Lord), who is the Creator and Redeemer of </p>
<p>all humanity. “Knowing” (17:3) refers to having intimate relationship with </p>
<p>God, who is one (Deut 6:4; John 5:44; 1 Cor 8:6) and true (3:33; 7:28; 8:26), </p>
<p>and to one’s personal experience with Jesus Christ, whom the same God </p>
<p>sent into the world to give heavenly life to those who believe.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>God’s sending of the Son is followed by Jesus’ triumphant statement, </p>
<p>“I gloried you on earth, having nished the work that you gave me to do” </p>
<p>(17:4). Jesus was sent into the world with the work of revealing God in his </p>
<p>glory throughout his ministry (1:14, 18; 2:11; 11:40; 13:31). ough the </p>
<p>given task will be fully accomplished on the cross (12:23, 27, 28; 13:32; </p>
<p>19:30), Jesus, who has perceived that the “hour” is already set in opera-</p>
<p>tion (17:1), prays condently that he has nished the work of glorifying the </p>
<p>Father. He therefore asks the Father to glorify him in God’s own presence </p>
<p>with the glory that he had with God before the world came into being (17:5; </p>
<p>cf. 1:1–2; 17:24; Wis 7:25; 9:10–11) and before his incarnation (12:41). Now </p>
<p>Jesus asks for that pre-existent glory to be given to him aer he ascends to </p>
<p>God’s presence (6:62; 13:32).</p>
<p>Jesus’ prayer for his disciples (17:6–19) </p>
<p>Before Jesus prays for his disciples, he gives to God, who sent him, an ac-</p>
<p>count of what he has done for them (17:6–8). First, he acknowledges that </p>
<p>the people of God’s community were given to Jesus by God (17:2, 9, 11). </p>
<p>roughout his earthly ministry, he manifested God’s name to them. God’s </p>
<p>glory was revealed to Moses in terms of God’s name (Exod 3:13–14; 33:18–</p>
<p>19; 34:5–6). In John too “name” and “glory” are used interchangeably (cf. </p>
<p>17:11–12 with 17:22, 24; the verb “to manifest” alludes to the manifesta-</p>
<p>tion of his glory in 2:11). God’s name or glory implies his character, eternal </p>
<p>existence, and work of salvation among humans. Jesus revealed to his fol-</p>
<p>lowers God’s character of love and life-giving work by his name, “I Am” </p>
<p>(cf. 14:8–11). In the OT, God’s name dwelt in his temple (Deut 12:5, 11; </p>
<p>1 Kgs 8:13, 17–20, 29; 9:3; 2 Chr 6:20), which was lled with his glory (1 </p>
<p>Kgs 8:10–11). Jesus made known God’s name (17:6, 26) in the sense that he </p>
<p>revealed himself as the Tabernacle/Temple where God put his name/glory </p>
<p>5. “Knowing the Lord” means also “turning to the Lord” so that his people may live </p>
<p>before him (Hos 6:1–3); Dodd 1958: 163.</p>
