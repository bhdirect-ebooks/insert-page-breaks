<p>John 20:30–31</p>
<p>203</p>
<p>John’s purpose as conclusion (20:30–31) </p>
<p>John, uniquely, gives his purpose of writing the Gospel at its end. e refer-</p>
<p>ences to what is and what is not written in the book hint that it is drawing to </p>
<p>a close.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Such conclusions with additional material, perhaps an epilogue,</p>
<p>were common in the writings of that time (e.g., Phil 3:1; 4:8–9; 1 John 5:13; </p>
<p>cf. 1 Macc 9:22).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Bultmann believed that 20:30–31 is the conclusion for</p>
<p>the “Book of Signs” (1:19—12:50), since the word “signs” appears only in </p>
<p>20:30 aer 12:37.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>However, all signs recorded in 1:19—12:50 were done</p>
<p>not in the presence of the disciples, but before those who did not believe in </p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>e expression “many other signs” means all the signs recorded and</p>
<p>even not recorded in John. Jesus’ death on the cross is the supreme sign, </p>
<p>because all signs lead to the cross where God’s glory was supremely mani-</p>
<p>fested (cf. 2:18–19, 21–22; 3:14). Jesus’ death, resurrection, and ascension </p>
<p>to the Father, which all constitute one event, are the greatest signs, because </p>
<p>in them the symbol (the signs) and reality (the cross) converge.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>erefore</p>
<p>we may take 20:30–31 as conclusion for the whole Gospel. </p>
<p>Jesus, then, did before his disciples many other signs that are not writ-</p>
<p>ten in this book (20:30), and if everything were to be written, the universe </p>
<p>itself could not contain the books written (21:25). However, what is written </p>
<p>is sucient to instill faith within the readers and hearers. Jesus performed </p>
<p>signs publicly “in the presence of the disciples” so that they would see the </p>
<p>glory of God in them and testify to him. On their testimony God’s new </p>
<p>community is built (cf. Eph 2:20). </p>
<p>e purpose of John writing the selected signs is twofold: (i) that the </p>
<p>readers may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and (ii) that by </p>
believing they may have divine life in his name (20:31). e phrase “that
<p>you may believe” can be understood to mean either that the Gospel was </p>
<p>written to bring the readers to faith, if the Greek subjunctive is read as aor-</p>
<p>ist tense, or that the Gospel was written to encourage the existing believers </p>
<p>to continue in faith, if the Greek subjunctive is understood as present tense </p>
<p>(see the Introduction). </p>
