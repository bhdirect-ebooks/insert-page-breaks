<p>not believe in Jesus (7:3–5). Jesus’ answer, “My time has not yet come” (7:6), </p>
<p>implies that Jesus’ fulllment of God’s work cannot be controlled by family </p>
<p>or earthly relationships (cf. 2:4). He tells his brothers that “your time” is </p>
<p>always available for you. Jesus’ “my time” refers to the time set by God for </p>
<p>which he has to wait, whereas “your time” implies his brothers’ readiness </p>
<p>to act at any time, as they are not governed by the God-appointed mission </p>
<p>but by their own convenience. Jesus contends that the world cannot hate </p>
<p>his brothers, because they are on the side of the world in their unbelief, but </p>
<p>that the world hates him because by his testimony he exposes the world’s </p>
<p>evil deeds (7:7; cf. 3:19–20; 15:18, 23). By refusing to follow his brothers’ </p>
<p>advice, Jesus tells them, “you go to the feast,” for his time, appointed by the </p>
<p>Father, to reveal his messianic identity has not yet fully come. So saying, </p>
<p>he remained in Galilee (7:8–9). Jesus’ messianic identity in John was kept </p>
<p>secret to the unbelievers like Jesus’ brothers, but was revealed to those who </p>
<p>believed in him (e.g., 6:69). ere is a concealed manifestation of Jesus as </p>
<p>the Christ in John.</p>
<p>Aer his brothers had gone up to the feast, Jesus goes up not publicly </p>
<p>but secretly (7:10). “e Jews,” who had come for the feast, were searching </p>
<p>for him at the feast and started muttering among themselves about Jesus’ </p>
<p>identity. Some appreciated him as a good man, probably because they had </p>
<p>seen his healing done in Jerusalem, but others accused him of leading the </p>
<p>crowd astray (John 7:11–12; cf. Luke 23:2), probably because he broke </p>
<p>the Sabbath law and made himself equal with God (5:18).</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>However, the</p>
<p>people feared the Jewish leaders, who had imposed punishment on those </p>
<p>who believed in Jesus (cf. 9:22; 12:42), and did not speak openly about </p>
<p>Jesus (7:13).</p>
<p>Veiled references to Jesus as the Christ (7:14–36) </p>
<p>Soon aer Jesus joined the feast in the middle of the eight-day celebration, </p>
<p>he went up to the temple to teach (7:14). He must have taught on the sig-</p>
<p>nicance of the feast of Tabernacles from the scriptures, pointing out how </p>
<p>they testify to him as the Christ (5:39–40, 45–47), and this explains why </p>
<p>the Jewish crowd was amazed at Jesus’ knowledge of the scriptures. In their </p>
<p>view, Jesus never studied the scriptures under a rabbi (7:15). In response, </p>
<p>2. In the late rst century the Jewish authorities accused Christians of leading people </p>
<p>astray from monotheism. John nds Jesus as having already faced the same charge dur-</p>
<p>ing his lifetime.</p>
