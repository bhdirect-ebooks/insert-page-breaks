<p>John 18:12–27</p>
<p>175</p>
<p>brought Peter in aer speaking with the maid who kept the door (18:16). </p>
<p>Obviously he was familiar to the doorkeeper and to other servants in the </p>
<p>high priest’s palace. Who is this “other disciple”? Many scholars believe that </p>
<p>he is “the disciple whom Jesus loved,” mainly because of his association </p>
<p>with Peter. John 20:2, where the “other disciple” is mentioned in apposition </p>
<p>to “the one whom Jesus loved,” seems to conrm this view. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, wherever John speaks of the beloved disciple, he plainly </p>
<p>mentions it. In 20:2 John mentions “the other disciple, the one whom Jesus </p>
<p>loved,” whereas in 18:15–16 he speaks of “the other disciple who was known </p>
<p>to the high priest.” If the beloved disciple is John the son of Zebedee, as is </p>
<p>likely, then it is dicult to explain how a Galilean sherman was known </p>
<p>to the high priest. Some suggest that Zebedee and his sons were purveyors </p>
<p>of sh by appointment to the high priest, but the Jews generally did not </p>
<p>regard the trade highly.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>e Greek gnōstos, which also means “related [to</p>
<p>the high priest],” makes it improbable that the “other disciple” in 18:15–16 </p>
<p>is the beloved disciple. A mere business contact would not have prompted </p>
<p>the maid to permit Peter enter the courtyard during trial proceedings. If </p>
<p>she could easily recognize Peter as the one who was with Jesus (18:17), how </p>
<p>easily would she have recognized the “other disciple,” if he was the beloved </p>
<p>disciple, as the one who was with Jesus? </p>
<p>ere is no denite ground for identifying the disciple with the be-</p>
<p>loved disciple.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>ere are several characters whose names are hidden in</p>
<p>John. For example, one of the disciples of John the Baptist who followed </p>
<p>Jesus remains hidden (1:37–41). e mother of Jesus is not mentioned by </p>
<p>name throughout the Gospel. John introduces some nameless characters </p>
<p>that play their part in key places and then disappear (e.g., 4:4–42; 6:9; 21:2). </p>
<p>Similarly, the “other disciple,” though not one of the Twelve, was a follower </p>
<p>of Jesus and could have belonged to a priestly family in Jerusalem and </p>
<p>thereby had “acquaintance” with the high priest. erefore he could enter </p>
<p>through the chief priest’s “courtyard” and help Peter to come in (cf. Matt </p>
<p>26:58 par.).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Possibly he is one of the unnamed disciples of Jesus (21:2),</p>
<p>John the Elder, the real author of the Gospel.</p>

<p>ars who deny that the “other disciple” in 18:15–16 is the beloved disciple, see Quast 1989: </p>
<p>77–79, though Quast himself identies him with the beloved disciple.</p>
