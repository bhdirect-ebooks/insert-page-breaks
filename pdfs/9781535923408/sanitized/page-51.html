<p>best wine rst so that the guests would appreciate the host’s provision, and </p>
<p>then, aer too much drinking, oering the wine of lesser quality (2:10).</p>

<p> </p>
<p>e master thus never understood the work of Jesus.</p>
<p>By following the Jewish rite of purication to do his rst sign (literally </p>
<p>“beginning of the signs”), Jesus brings out the truth that the real meaning of </p>
<p>the Jewish religious customs is fullled only in him, who transforms the old </p>
<p>ceremonial system into something that human beings can experience. Jesus </p>
<p>replaces the old Jewish ritual order with his own new order.</p>
<p>In the OT, the “sweet wine” supplied by God to his people is the mark </p>
<p>of deliverance from exile (Jer 31:12; Amos 9:13–14) and of prosperity (Joel </p>
<p>3:18), and it has an eschatological connotation also. In the light of this, Je-</p>
<p>sus’ conversion of water into wine indicates that the long-awaited kingdom </p>
<p>of God has arrived and that God himself has drawn near in the person and </p>
<p>ministry of Jesus to fulll his promise of abundant blessings.</p>

<p>e narrative</p>
<p>of the wedding at Cana reaches its climax in 2:11, where the manifestation </p>
<p>of Jesus’ glory through this sign leads the disciples to believe in him, while </p>
<p>for others it is only a satisfaction of physical thirst (see comments on 1:14 </p>
<p>for understanding “glory”). is sign renews the disciples’ commitment to </p>
<p>Jesus and leads them into deeper faith.</p>
<p>Aer this sign, Jesus went to Capernaum with his mother, brothers, </p>
<p>and disciples and stayed a few days there (2:12). is is a symbol of the </p>
<p>corporate life of the new community, which includes men and women, </p>
<p>centered in Jesus.</p>
<p>Jesus’ revolutionary act in the temple (2:13–22) </p>
<p>In 2:13 there is an abrupt shi from Capernaum (2:12) to Jerusalem. In the </p>
<p>Synoptic accounts, Jesus enters into Jerusalem only once, at the end of his </p>
<p>ministry, but in John Jesus makes four visits to Jerusalem, mainly during </p>
<p>the Passover (2:13; 5:1; 7:10, 14; 12:9, 12). During one of his visits Jesus </p>
<p>cleansed the Jerusalem temple and subsequently confronted the Jewish </p>
<p>leaders (2:13–22). In the Synoptic Gospels this event is narrated nearly at </p>
<p>the end of Jesus’ ministry (Matt 21:12–17 par.), whereas in John it is placed </p>
<p>in the beginning of Jesus’ ministry. One cannot prove that Jesus cleansed </p>
<p>the temple twice. For John chronology has only marginal signicance. In </p>
