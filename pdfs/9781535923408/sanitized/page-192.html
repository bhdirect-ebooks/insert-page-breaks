<p>Joy and Peace aer Tribulation</p>
<p>164</p>
<p>“By this we believe that you came from God” (16:30). “By this” looks back </p>
<p>to all the plain statements of Jesus in 16:25–28. However, Jesus questions </p>
<p>them, “Do you now believe?” (16:31). e particle “now,” which is put in </p>
<p>an emphatic position in Greek, indicates Jesus’ exclamation that in spite </p>
<p>of his earlier disclosure that he came from the Father and goes back to the </p>
<p>Father (8:14; 13:3, 33; 14:2–7; 16:5), his followers believe only now, just </p>
<p>before the “hour” of his exaltation on the cross (16:32)! ey were unaware </p>
<p>how ckle was their belief and hence Jesus’ question has both irony and </p>
<p>exasperation.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jesus predicts that at the coming of an hour, which has already come, </p>
<p>all his disciples will go scattered by leaving him alone (16:32). Although </p>
<p>the word “hour” occurs here without the denite article, the context refers </p>
<p>to the time of Jesus’ arrest and death rather than the life of the church aer </p>
<p>Jesus’ resurrection. When Jesus will be put to death, those who confessed </p>
<p>their faith will be scattered (cf. Matt 26:31; Mark 14:27) and go “every one </p>
<p>to his own home.” at is, by leaving Jesus alone, each person will go to his </p>
<p>own works</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>(cf. Matt 26:56b; Mark 14:50).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Jesus reminds his followers, “And I am not alone, for the </p>
<p>Father is with me” (16:32b). e Father has always been with Jesus (cf. 5:17; </p>
<p>8:16, 29). Even when Jesus enters into the hour set by the Father to glorify </p>
<p>him by his death, the Father is with him. e concluding verse draws the </p>
<p>key points from the whole Pastoral Speech, as the opening sentence, “I </p>
<p>have spoken these things to you,” shows. He tells them that he delivered </p>
<p>his speech so that in him they may have peace. ey may experience peace </p>
<p>(“prosperity and God’s salvation”) as they live in communion with Jesus. </p>
<p>In contrast, in the world Jesus’ followers have “tribulation,” a word which </p>
<p>refers to the birthpangs that God’s people will undergo at the end of the age </p>
<p>(Mark 13:7–8, 19, 24–25) as well as now (16:33a).</p>
<p>Jesus encourages his own to be of good cheer in the phase of tribula-</p>
<p>tion by assuring that he has already overcome the evil in the world (16:33b). </p>
<p>is means that persecution will have no power over them, as Jesus will </p>
<p>have won victory on the cross (12:31). ose who believe Jesus also will </p>
<p>overcome the evil in the world by the power of Jesus’ cross (1 John 2:13–14; </p>
<p>4:4; 5:4–5).</p>
