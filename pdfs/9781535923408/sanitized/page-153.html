<p>John 12:1–11</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>A great crowd of Jewish people heard that Jesus was in Bethany and </p>
<p>came there to see Jesus and also Lazarus, whom he had raised from the </p>
<p>dead (12:9). On account of Lazarus many Jews went to Jesus and believed </p>
<p>in him (12:11). us Lazarus became the means of drawing people to Jesus. </p>
<p>e mass following behind Jesus made the chief priests to plan to kill Laza-</p>
<p>rus also (12:10). It is ironic that the Jewish leaders were seeking to kill the </p>
<p>innocents during the Passover, which commemorates God’s gi of freedom </p>
<p>and new life.</p>

<p>Revolutionary entry of Jesus into Jerusalem (12:12–19) </p>
<p>On the next day of the anointing, a great crowd of pilgrims (cf. 12:9) heard </p>
<p>that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. Out of joy they took the branches </p>
<p>of palm trees and went out to meet him. John alone species the palm </p>
<p>branches used by the crowd and not the garments that were spread along </p>
<p>the road before Jesus (Matt 21:8; Mark 11:8). Palm branches were mainly </p>
<p>used to give a jubilant welcome to a king or warrior and as a mark of joy </p>
<p>and thanksgiving for God’s deliverance (1 Macc 13:51; 2 Macc 10:7; cf. Rev </p>
<p>7:9; T. Naph. 5:4).</p>
<p>e crowd acclaims that Jesus is “the one who comes in the name of </p>
<p>the Lord” and “the King of Israel” (12:13; cf. Zeph 3:15). It implies that </p>
<p>Jesus is the Christ (11:27) and Son of God (1:49), who enters into Jerusalem </p>
<p>to overcome his enemies revolutionarily by his suering, death, and resur-</p>
<p>rection. ey cry “Hosanna,” which means, “Save now, we pray” (cf. 2 Sam </p>
<p>14:4 MT), a prayer that was turned into a cry of praise to the messianic </p>
<p>King. e greeting “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord” was </p>
<p>used to give thanks to the Lord for his salvation and also as a prayer for the </p>
<p>coming Messiah (Ps 118:25–27; the epithet “he who comes” denotes the </p>
<p>expected Messiah in Matt 3:11; 11:3; 23:39; John 11:27). Unknowingly, the </p>
<p>crowd acclaims the truth that Jesus is the Davidic Messiah, the King. </p>
<p>In John, Jesus sits on a young ass aer the crowd’s acclamation (12:14) </p>
<p>to exhibit that he comes as a humble and accessible king rather than as a </p>
<p>political gure with military power and glory. Jesus’ riding on a young ass is </p>
<p>presented as the fulllment of Zech 9:9, which refers to the coming King of </p>
<p>the Jews humbly seated on an ass’s colt (12:15). John changes the OT com-</p>
<p>mand “Rejoice greatly” to “Fear not” (cf. Zeph 3:14–17; Isa 35:4; 44:6–8). It </p>
<p>assures people not to fear, as they used to the Roman authoritarianism, for </p>
