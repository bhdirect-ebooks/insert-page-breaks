<p>John 3:13–21</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>52:13—53:12). Similarly, both meanings in John refer to one event: Jesus’ </p>
<p>death on the cross, which is an act of being lied up and exalted/gloried </p>
<p>(12:23–24, 32–33). In the glorication of the Son of Man on the cross the </p>
<p>Father reveals his glory (13:31–32). Both Jesus’ death and ascension aer </p>
<p>resurrection are merged together in the verb “lied up.”</p>
<p>In order to rectify the Israelites’ sin that caused poisonous snakes to </p>
<p>bite them to death (Num 21:5–9), Moses made a ery serpent with bronze </p>
<p>and set it on a pole so that anyone bitten by a snake could look up to the </p>
<p>bronze serpent and live. Similarly, the Johannine Jesus is the one who, in </p>
<p>accordance with God’s plan, must be lied up on a pole, the cross, so that </p>
<p>everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. Instead of “looking </p>
<p>up” to the bronze serpent, John has “believing in him,” and in the place of </p>
<p>“would live” John has “eternal life” (3:15). Looking to the lied-up serpent </p>
<p>is the mark of “turning towards” God and so also is believing in the lied-</p>
<p>up Son of Man (Wis 16:7).</p>
<p>at the one who believes in him has eternal life is a recurring theme </p>
<p>in John (see 3:15–16; 5:24; 6:40, 47; 20:31). “Believing” means “coming to </p>
<p>Jesus” in obedience (6:35–37; cf. 12:35–36), and this is the same as “turning </p>
<p>towards God.” It also means appropriating Jesus’ life that is available on the </p>
<p>cross. “Believing” and “eating his esh and drinking his blood” lead one </p>
<p>to eternal life (6:53–54). “Believing” is also used in parallel with “seeing” </p>
<p>(12:44–45). e crown and culmination of all Greek words for “seeing” is </p>
<p>to be found in the word “believing.”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>“Believing” in John is synonymous to</p>
<p>“receiving” and “knowing” in the sense of coming into intimate relation-</p>
<p>ship with Jesus (1:12; 17:8). e purpose of God in exalting Jesus is that </p>
<p>those who believe in the Son of Man lied up on the cross should have </p>
<p>eternal life (3:15). </p>
<p>“Eternal life” refers to the “life of the age to come” (cf. Dan 12:2). is </p>
<p>life will be given at the resurrection of the believers on the last day (John </p>
<p>6:54) and therefore it is called the “resurrection of life” (5:29; cf. 5:25). </p>
<p>Sometimes John uses the word “life” to denote “eternal life” (e.g., 6:33, 51; </p>
<p>20:31). It is the very life of God given by him to Jesus (5:26; 6:57; cf. 1:4) </p>
<p>and is obtained now and in future by those who believe in Jesus. Jesus gives </p>
<p>life to whom he wills (5:21) and it cannot be destroyed by physical death </p>
<p>(11:26). It is the life of the kingdom of God given to those who are born of </p>
<p>the Spirit (3:3, 5). ose who obey Jesus’ words and believe in the Father </p>
<p>who sent him have already passed from death to life (5:24). Since Jesus is </p>
