<p>Proper Setting for the Dialogue</p>

<p>in about the “sixth hour” (12 noon) near the well, which was called “Jacob’s </p>
<p>Well” (4:6), probably by leaning on the wall built around the well. e in-</p>
<p>dication of time is not only to highlight the historical reliability of Jesus’ </p>
<p>ministry in Samaria, but also the fact that it was a high day when living </p>
<p>beings needed water to quench their thirst (cf. Gen 29:7). Jesus’ weariness </p>
<p>and thirst (4:7) prove his full humanity and his supernatural knowledge </p>
(4:1) proves his full divinity (cf. 1:47–48; 2:23–25).
<p>Jesus’ self-revelation to the Samaritan woman (4:7–26) </p>
<p>A woman of Samaria came to draw water from the well. She came alone in </p>
<p>the midday, when usually not many women come to the well. is shows </p>
<p>that the woman had been isolated from other women because of her per-</p>
<p>version from moral standard (cf. 4:16–18). Jesus takes the initiative to start </p>
<p>his dialogue with her by asking for water (literally “Give me to drink”; 4:7). </p>
<p>Truly Jesus needed water to quench his thirst, but at the same time it is </p>
<p>ironic that the one who can supply living water to quench her thirst forever </p>
<p>is the one who asks her for water to drink (4:14; cf. 19:28). At this point, </p>
<p>John comments that Jesus’ disciples had gone away into the city to buy food </p>
<p>(4:8), providing to the dialogue a relevant setting. </p>
<p>As the woman found Jesus to be a Jew, she said with astonishment, </p>
<p>“How do you, being a Jew, ask from me, a Samaritan woman, for a drink?” </p>
<p>en the editor claries that the Jews have no dealings with Samaritans </p>
<p>(4:9). is indicates that there was hatred among the Jews against Samari-</p>
<p>tans, to the extent that they would not use the vessels used by the Samari-</p>
<p>tans for purity reasons.</p>

<p>e rabbis taught the Jews not to eat Samaritans’</p>
<p>cooking or to have any ritual contact with them. </p>
<p>e Samaritans were the people consisting of ve nations whom the </p>
<p>Assyrians brought in when they captured Samaritan cities in the eighth </p>
<p>century BCE. Aer a priest, at the command of the Assyrian king, came </p>
<p>and lived in Bethel to teach them the law of Yahweh, the Samaritan re-</p>
<p>ligion became a mixture of the worship of Yahweh and of dierent gods </p>
<p>brought in by the foreigners. Consequently, there was no fear or obedi-</p>
<p>ence to Yahweh and his commandments (2 Kgs 17:24–34, 41). e Jews, </p>
<p>who returned from exile in 538 BCE, found the Samaritans political rebels </p>
<p>4. Although the Greek expression ou syngkhrasthai generally means “to have no deal-</p>
<p>ings with,” in this context 4:9 needs to be read as: “Jews do not use (vessels) together with </p>
<p>Samaritans”; Daube 1950: 137–47, esp. 137–39, 144 (m. Nid. 4:1).</p>
