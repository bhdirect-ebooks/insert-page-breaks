<p>Two Predictions Sandwiched by Jesus’ New Commandment</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>believers will all people recognize them as Jesus’ followers (13:35). Love is </p>
<p>not just an emotional expression, but it involves helping the needy (1 John </p>
<p>3:17–18). It is sacricial love to the extent of giving one’s life for the welfare </p>
<p>of others, just as Jesus did (15:12–13; 1 John 3:16; 4:7–12). Love and self-</p>
<p>sacrice are reciprocal actions.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Jesus’ love for his followers is the ground</p>
<p>on which they can love one another. It is essential to experience Jesus’ love </p>
<p>before we love our fellow-beings. </p>
<p>Peter’s denial foretold (13:36–38) </p>
<p>Jesus’ saying “Where I am going, you cannot come” (13:33) and the refer-</p>
<p>ence to Peter’s laying down of his life for Jesus (13:37) link 13:36–38 with </p>
<p>7:33–34. For Simon Peter’s question “Lord, where are you going?,” Jesus </p>
<p>gives a ray of hope by assuring that Peter will follow him aerward, if not </p>
<p>now, to the place where he is going (13:36). Jesus already said that he will go </p>
<p>to God who sent him (7:33; cf. 14:2–3), but his disciples did not understand </p>
<p>it (13:36a; 14:5). Jesus’ statement that Peter will follow aerward highlights </p>
<p>Jesus’ ascension to the Father, to be followed by his disciples later. </p>
<p>Peter is hasty to follow Jesus now, without understanding Jesus’ re-</p>
<p>demptive death by which he would go to the Father. erefore he questions </p>
<p>Jesus, “Lord, why cannot I follow you now?” He conrms his love for Jesus </p>
<p>by promising that he will lay down his life for his Master (13:37). Jesus will </p>
<p>lay down his life for the salvation of humankind (10:11, 15), whereas Peter </p>
<p>wants to prove emotionally his loyalty for his Master by dying for him (cf. </p>
<p>Matt 26:35 par.)! Peter’s words embody “an absurd parody of Jesus’ own,” </p>
<p>putting him in control of his own life.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> However, ironically what he prom-</p>
<p>ised at human level will happen later when the risen Jesus will ask Peter to </p>
<p>follow him (21:18–19). Peter cannot go, at the natural level, through the </p>
<p>same death and resurrection as Jesus, but he can die for Jesus while serving </p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>As Jesus knew the impossibility of Peter to die for him, he predicted </p>
<p>with the solemn armation “truly, truly, I say to you” that the cock would </p>
<p>not crow until Peter denies him thrice (13:38). Jesus indicates that the hu-</p>
<p>man fallen nature is weak and insucient to follow him and that it will </p>
<p>soon be proved true in Peter’s life. Jesus’ sarcastic question, “Will you lay </p>
<p>down your life for me?,” which expects the answer, “no,” conrms this. Jesus </p>
