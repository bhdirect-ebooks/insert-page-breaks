<p>e Betrayal of Jesus</p>
<p>174</p>
<p>(18:11a; cf. Matt 26:52a). Jesus calls Peter to exercise patience and non-</p>
<p>violence even when others act violently, for his kingdom is not to be estab-</p>
<p>lished by swords and weapons, but by love and non-violence (cf. 18:36). </p>
<p>Jesus voluntarily submitted to face suerings, betrayal, arrest and cru-</p>
<p>cixion. erefore he questions Peter, “Shall I not drink the cup which the </p>
<p>Father has given me?” (18:11b), which expects the answer “yes.” “Cup” here </p>
<p>is a metaphor for Jesus’ suering and death (Matt 20:22–23; 26:42 par.). </p>
<p>e term implies in the OT “cup of God’s wrath,” which evildoers should </p>
<p>drink (Ps 75:8; Isa 51:17, 22; Jer 25:15–17; Ezek 23:31–34; Hab 2:16).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Jesus</p>
<p>must taste God’s wrath in terms of suering and death as a propitiation for </p>
<p>human sin (Rom 3:25). He was willing to do so. </p>
<p>The Jewish trial and Peter’s denial (18:12–27) </p>
<p>Since Jesus voluntary submitted himself, the cohort of soldiers, its </p>
<p>commander,</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>and the temple ocials could seize Jesus easily and bind him</p>
<p>(18:12). First they led him to Annas, the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was </p>
<p>the high priest that year (18:13; cf. 11:49, 51). Annas was the high priest in </p>
<p>6–15 CE and his son-in-law, Caiaphas, functioned as high priest in 15–36 </p>
<p>CE. No wonder Annas was still an inuential gure to interrogate Jesus.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Caiaphas will be remembered by John’s readers from his unconscious </p>
<p>prophecy made in the council that it was expedient that one man should </p>
<p>die for the people (18:14; 11:49–50). John’s reminder looks forward to the </p>
<p>vicarious and benecial death of Jesus for all people groups. </p>
<p>Leaving what happened in Annas’ court to narrate in 18:19–24, John </p>
<p>shis the scene to the rst denial of Peter made outside the high priest’s </p>
<p>palace. e Greek word aulēn means “sheepfold” (10:1, 16), but here it </p>
<p>means “the central courtyard of the palace.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> Simon Peter was following Je-</p>
<p>sus along with “another disciple,” who could enter into the court of the high </p>
<p>priest along with Jesus because he was known to the high priest (18:15). </p>
<p>Unlike in the Synoptic accounts (Matt 26:58 par.), Peter could not enter the </p>
<p>courtyard on his own, but stood outside the door until the “other disciple” </p>

<p>7. e Greek khiliarkhos means “leader of a thousand soldiers” or “commander of a </p>
<p>cohort.”</p>
<p>8. When the Romans appointed and replaced the high priests, the Jews regarded high </p>
<p>priesthood as lifetime oce (cf. Num 35:25). Josephus recognizes Jonathan as high priest </p>
<p>even een years aer of his deposition (J.W. 2.12.6).</p>
