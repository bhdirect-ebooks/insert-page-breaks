<p>John 6:22–59</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>Jesus’ self-revelation as the life-giving bread (6:22–59) </p>
<p>Arrival of the people to Capernaum (6:22–25a)</p>
<p>e crowd fed by Jesus was eagerly looking for him. As there were no boats </p>
<p>to take them to the other side of the sea, they stayed that night in the place </p>
<p>where they had eaten. “On the next day” (6:22), being the day aer Jesus </p>
<p>walked on the sea, the crowd realized that there was on the shore only one </p>
<p>boat, used by Jesus and his disciples. ey had also seen Jesus’ disciples </p>
<p>going to Capernaum on that boat without Jesus and they could not see </p>
<p>Jesus either (6:24). On that day some boats came from Tiberias to the place </p>
<p>where the people had eaten (6:23). John reiterates that Jesus gave thanks to </p>
<p>God before the bread was supplied, reminding the readers of God’s work of </p>
<p>feeding the hungry in Jesus. ey boarded the boats sailing to Capernaum, </p>
<p>on the other side of the sea (6:24), and found him there (6:25a).</p>
<p>Jesus’ encounter with the crowd (6:25b–34) </p>
<p>Aer the people found Jesus, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you come </p>
<p>here?” without knowing that he walked on the sea and crossed (6:25b). By </p>
<p>means of the “truly, truly, I say to you” formula, Jesus expresses the most </p>
<p>reliable truth (6:26) and chides them for seeking him only because they ate </p>
<p>their ll. Loaves and sh cannot satisfy human hunger permanently and </p>
<p>so the people wanted more. ey could not see Jesus’ glory and believe in </p>
<p>him (6:29, 30, 36). Jesus exhorts them, therefore, not to spend their energy </p>
<p>by working for the food that perishes, but to work for the food that gives </p>
<p>eternal life (6:27a). e point of this dualism is that the food that leads to </p>
<p>eternal life should be primarily sought, although earthly food is needed for </p>
<p>human livelihood. </p>
e divine life that Jesus, the Son of Man, gives has both present and
<p>future value (cf. 3:14–15; 5:27–29), because “on him God the Father set </p>
<p>his seal” (6:27b). God has delegated his authority exclusively to Jesus to </p>
<p>give heavenly life to all who believe in him (cf. 3:33; 5:21, 24, 27). He gave </p>
<p>his Spirit to Jesus as the stamp of his approval and ownership on Jesus (cf. </p>
<p>2 Cor 1:22; Eph 1:13), not necessarily at Jesus’ baptism,</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>but even in his</p>
<p>pre-existent state, for the Greek aorist tense “set [his seal]” means God’s </p>
<p>once-and-for-all action. </p>
