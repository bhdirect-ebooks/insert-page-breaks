<p>John 1:19–28</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Foundation of the Community of Faith (1:19–51) </p>
<p>Witness of John the Baptist (1:19–28) </p>
<p>e narrative of Jesus’ life and ministry begins with the witness of John </p>
<p>the Baptist to Jesus (cf. Matt 3:1–12; Mark 1:1–8; Luke 1:1–17). e com-</p>
<p>mencing word “and” in 1:19 marks the continuity between the prologue </p>
<p>and the whole Gospel story, by having the testimony of the Baptist as the </p>
<p>starting point for the formation of new covenant community around Jesus. </p>
<p>ere was an apprehension among the religious leaders in Jerusalem about </p>
<p>the Baptist’s ministry, which drew many to become his disciples. erefore </p>
<p>they sent a delegation of priests and Levites to John the Baptist to gather </p>
<p>rsthand information about his real identity and the purpose of his mis-</p>
<p>sion. e delegates met the Baptist at “Bethany beyond Jordan,” where John </p>
<p>was baptizing (1:28).</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>e term “the Jews” in 1:19, in conjunction with 1:24, indicates “the </p>
<p>Pharisees,” the “separated ones.”</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>ese religious leaders had separated</p>
<p>themselves politically from Hasmonean rule and religiously from others </p>
<p>who were not observing the priestly laws of purity (Lev 1–15). ey had </p>
<p>vast political and social inuence in Jesus’ time,</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>but rejected Jesus as the</p>
<p>Messiah. erefore they are identied in John with “the world,” which, </p>
<p>in general, rejected Jesus (John 1:10; 7:7; 15:18; cf. 8:23). In response to </p>
<p>their question, “Who are you?,” the Baptist answers, “I am not the Christ” </p>
<p>(1:19–20). Probably the leaders suspected that the Baptist could be the </p>
<p>long-awaited Messiah, the King and deliverer from the house of David. </p>
<p>However, they did not dare to ask him whether he was the Messiah. e </p>
<p>Baptist’s unreserved denial (cf. 3:28) could be a polemic against those who </p>
<p>claimed that he was the Messiah. </p>
<p>In Jesus’ time, the scribes taught that Elijah should come rst in order </p>
<p>to prepare the way for Christ’s appearance (Mal 3:1; 4:5–6; Mark 9:11–12). </p>
<p>at is why the priests and Levites asked the Baptist, “Are you Elijah?” </p>
<p>(John 1:21). Aer the Baptist’s denial that he was Elijah, they asked him, </p>
<p>23. Possibly the “Bethany beyond Jordan” was on the eastern side of Jordan up in the </p>
<p>northern end of Peraea, closer to Aenon (near Salim), a place of springs in the western </p>
<p>bank of Jordan. </p>
<p>24. For various shades of meaning of the term “the Jews” in John see Grith 2008: </p>
<p>185; Brown 2010: 157–75. e term also refers to the Jews who genuinely believed in </p>
<p>Jesus aer seeing Jesus’ sign (11:45).</p>
