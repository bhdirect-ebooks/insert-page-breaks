<p>John 6:60–71</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>the service of God (cf. Lev 21:6–8, 15; 22:9; 2 Chr 23:6; 35:3). Jesus was set </p>
<p>apart to fulll God’s mission in the world. In this sense, Jesus is the “Holy </p>
<p>One of God,” the Christ.</p>
<p>Jesus had foreknown that one of the Twelve was a devil (6:70; cf. 13:2), </p>
<p>the prince of evil and the ruler of this world (12:31; 14:30; 16:11). e “dev-</p>
<p>il” is also “Satan” (13:27), who instigated Judas to betray Jesus. e narrator </p>
<p>explains that Jesus was speaking of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot and one </p>
<p>of the Twelve, who would betray Jesus (6:71).</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>Judas was not merely to be</p>
<p>used by the devil, but he himself was a devil, for nally he chose to be a tool </p>
<p>of the devil, who always stands in opposition to Jesus. By mentioning Judas’ </p>
<p>betrayal, the beginning of Jesus’ suering and death on the cross, John gives </p>
<p>a tting end to the whole discourse.</p>
<p>36. “Iscariot” may mean “man of Kerioth,” Kerioth being a town in southern Judea </p>
<p>(Brown 1978: 1.298). Cf. Jer 48:24, 41; Amos 2:2.</p>
