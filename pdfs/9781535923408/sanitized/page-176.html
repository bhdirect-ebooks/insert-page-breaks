<p>Jesus’ Promise to Send the Paraklētos </p>
<p>148</p>
<p>the Father to give them “another helper” (allos paraklētos) to be with them </p>
<p>forever (14:16).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>e word allos paraklētos is identied as “the Spirit of truth” (14:17; </p>
<p>cf. 15:26; 16:13) and the Holy Spirit (14:26).</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>e Spirit will be with Jesus’</p>
<p>disciples not merely in his absence, but until the end of this age and beyond </p>
<p>(“forever”). Jesus is the paraklētos who, as our advocate, intercedes for us </p>
<p>with the Father (1 John 2:1), and the Holy Spirit is allos paraklētos, in which </p>
<p>the word allos indicates “another of the same quality.” Jesus and the Spirit, </p>
<p>thus, have the same task of dwelling within Jesus’ followers and of interced-</p>
<p>ing for them with the Father.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Paraklētos can also mean “comforter,” a term</p>
<p>that the rabbis used as a title for the Messiah.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>e paraklētos is the one</p>
<p>who carries truth and who communicates truth (1:14, 16; 14:6). at is, </p>
<p>the Spirit communicates the faithfulness of God to all human beings and </p>
<p>particularly to God’s own community. e Spirit of truth is given by the </p>
<p>Father by hearing the prayer of his Son (14:16).</p>
<p>e world, being the realm of unbelief and evil, cannot receive the </p>
<p>Spirit, because it neither sees him nor knows him due to its rejection of </p>
<p>Jesus (14:17a; cf. 1:10; 3:19; 15:18–25; 17:14–16). In contrast, since the </p>
<p>paraklētos dwells within Jesus’ community, it can have an intimate relation-</p>
<p>ship with Jesus through the Spirit and with God through Jesus (14:17b). In </p>
<p>this sense, Jesus will not leave them as orphans and he will come to them </p>
<p>(14:18).</p>
<p>Jesus draws another contrast between the world and his disciples in </p>
<p>their relationship with Jesus (14:19). “Yet a little while, and the world will </p>
<p>see me no more” indicates a very little time le before Jesus will be hung </p>
<p>on the cross and the impossibility for the world to see him physically aer-</p>
<p>wards (cf. 7:33; 12:35; 16:16–19). In contrast, Jesus’ disciples will be able to </p>
<p>see him. e disciples will continue seeing him as risen Jesus within a short </p>
<p>time aer his death through his Spirit bestowed on them. Jesus uses again </p>
<p>the present tense, “Because I live,” foreseeing his immediate resurrection </p>
<p>from the dead. en he uses future tense to say, “You also will live.” is </p>
<p>10. Köstenberger (2009: 421, 434) translates allos paraklētos aptly as “another helping </p>
<p>presence.”</p>
<p>11. “e spirit of truth” is opposed to “the spirit of deceit or of injustice”; both are </p>
<p>placed within humankind to make them walk in wisdom or in folly, in justice and truth </p>
<p>or in injustice (1QS 3.18–19; 4.23; cf. T. Jud. 20:1–5); Lincoln 2006: 394.</p>
<p>12. e Greek word paraklētos is made up of para (“beside”) and klētos (“the called </p>
<p>one”), meaning “the one who is called beside” to help and support.</p>
<p>13. Wijingaards 1988: 58.</p>
