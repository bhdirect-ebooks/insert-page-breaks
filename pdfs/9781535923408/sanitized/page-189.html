<p>Messiah (cf. 4:25–26) rather than for the idols (Isa 41:22–23). is will </p>
<p>be done by the Spirit in the believers’ life at present. erefore Jesus </p>
<p>said, “All that the Father has is mine . . . and he will take what is mine </p>
<p>and declare it to you” (16:15). Just like the Father gave authority to </p>
<p>the Son to speak his words, the Son has given authority to the Spirit </p>
<p>to declare his words. e message of the Father, the Son, and the Holy </p>
<p>Spirit is identical because they, being essentially one, hear one another </p>
<p>in essential agreement.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>(iv) By speaking Jesus’ words, the Spirit brings glory to Jesus. e Spirit’s </p>
<p>work of glorifying Jesus (16:14a) has present and future dimensions. In </p>
<p>the present, the glory of Jesus, his love and faithfulness, is manifested </p>
<p>by the work of the Holy Spirit through the new covenant community </p>
<p>(cf. 17:10), and in the future the same Spirit will lead the church to see </p>
<p>Jesus’ glory for ever in the Father’s house (17:24).</p>
<p>Joy and peace after tribulation (16:16–33) </p>
<p>Aer declaring the functions of the Holy Spirit, Jesus now plainly says, “A </p>
<p>little while, and you will see me no more; again a little while, and you will </p>
<p>see me” (16:16). e rst “a little while” implies the time when Jesus will go </p>
<p>to the Father through his death on the cross and his disciples will see him </p>
<p>no more (16:17; cf. 16:5, 10). e same phrase used again implies Jesus’ res-</p>
<p>urrection appearances when they will see him. e disciples, however, ex-</p>
<p>press their puzzlement particularly over the phrase “a little while” (16:18), </p>
<p>told twice, referring to two forthcoming events in Jesus’ mission.</p>
<p>In the midst of non-understanding, Jesus’ supernatural knowledge is </p>
<p>highlighted: by knowing his followers’ wish to ask him of the meaning of </p>
<p>his statement (16:19), Jesus, by his o-repeated phrase “truly, truly, I say </p>
<p>to you,” assures that their sorrow will be turned into joy. At Jesus’ betrayal, </p>
<p>trial, and crucixion the community of believers will weep and lament and </p>
<p>become sorrowful, but the world, which hates Jesus and his own, will re-</p>
<p>joice by wrongly thinking that it has destroyed a “lawbreaker” (16:20). e </p>
<p>words “weeping” and “lamenting” oen denote the mourning for the dead </p>
<p>(Jer 22:10; Luke 23:27; John 11:31, 33; 20:11) and they point to Jesus’ fast-</p>
<p>approaching death. Nevertheless, Jesus’ resurrection, which will impart </p>
<p>new life, will turn the disciples’ sorrow into an exceeding joy. </p>
