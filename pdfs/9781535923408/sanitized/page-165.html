<p>John 13:1–20</p>

<p>e other related interpretation is that it is an exemplary act of the </p>
<p>Teacher before his pupils to emulate (13:12–20). e theme that only those </p>
<p>who are cleansed by Jesus can perform foot washing links both 13:1–11 </p>
<p>and 13:12–20. Aer washing of the disciples’ feet, including those of Judas </p>
<p>Iscariot, Jesus put on his outer garments and resumed his place. His ques-</p>
<p>tion, “Do you know what I have done to you?” (13:12), made the disciples </p>
<p>perplexed and they could not answer anything. erefore Jesus took the </p>
<p>initiative to answer. He reminded them that they address Jesus as “Teacher” </p>
<p>and “Lord” (13:13).</p>
<p>Many people regarded Jesus as “Teacher” more highly than they re-</p>
<p>garded the rabbis (1:38; 3:2; 11:28; 20:16). By virtue of listening to Jesus’ </p>
<p>teaching, his disciples soon accepted him as their “Teacher” (9:2; 13:13, </p>
<p>14). e Greek word kyrios generally means “sir” or “master” (4:11, 15, 19, </p>
<p>49; 5:7; 6:34; 8:11; 9:36; 20:15), but it denotes Jesus, who bears the name </p>
<p>of God, as “Lord” (6:23, 68, 69; 9:38; 11:27; 13:13–14; 20:20, 28; 21:7, 12). </p>
<p>e rst Christians did not hesitate to oer worship, due to God alone, to </p>
<p>the risen Jesus, for they saw God’s glory in Jesus’ incarnate life, death, and </p>
<p>resurrection. Jesus accepted these titles, but argued, “If . . . your Lord and </p>
<p>Teacher has washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet” </p>
<p>(13:14). He makes washing others’ feet an obligation to all those who were </p>
<p>cleansed by him. Jesus presents it as an example to follow by his disciples </p>
<p>(13:15). e act of foot washing decides the daily relationship with one </p>
<p>another in society, for it involves forgiving each other, clearing the hurts </p>
<p>caused to one another, confessing the mistakes to each other, performing </p>
<p>hospitality and acts of kindness, caring for the aicted, etc. (cf. 1 Tim 5:10). </p>
<p>Jesus, by means of “truly, truly, I say to you,” refers to a proverbial </p>
<p>saying well-known to his disciples (13:17a): “A slave is not greater than his </p>
<p>master nor the sent one than the one who sent him” (John 13:16; cf. Matt </p>
<p>10:24 par.). Jesus is the master, and his pupils, who are to serve their mas-</p>
<p>ter, are not greater than him. If the master himself washes the feet of his </p>
<p>subordinates, how much more his students should do what he did? Jesus’ </p>
<p>saying that the sent one is not greater than the one who sent him conveys </p>
<p>the same point and supports Jesus’ beatitude, “Blessed are you if you do </p>
<p>them” (13:17b). An ambassador is only a plenipotentiary, but the sender </p>
<p>has greater value and status than the sent agents. Jesus is the one who sends </p>
<p>the disciples into the world (17:18; 20:21). If the sender has shown God to </p>
