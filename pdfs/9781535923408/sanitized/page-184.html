<p>e World’s Hatred and Jesus’ Remedy</p>
<p>156</p>
<p>denitely hate his disciples (15:18). Jesus’ followers receive Jesus, the Light, </p>
<p>and hence perform good works, unlike the people of the world, who love </p>
<p>darkness to constantly practice evil (3:19–21). is dualism makes Jesus’ </p>
<p>people not belong to this world or support evildoers. erefore the people </p>
<p>of the world hate them. If Jesus’ community conformed to the world, the </p>
<p>world would love it (15:19a). If the world persecuted Jesus, it will also per-</p>
<p>secute those who belong to him, and if it obeyed Jesus’ message of salvation, </p>
<p>it would obey the words preached by his people as well. is is in accor-</p>
<p>dance with the proverb, “A servant is not greater than his master” (15:20; </p>
<p>cf. 13:16). What happened to Jesus, their Master, will also happen to his </p>
<p>pupils, since they are knit together, along with the Father, by love. e com-</p>
<p>munity of Jesus was facing the world’s hatred and persecution in the late </p>
<p>rst century, as it is even today.</p>
<p>Jesus’ community will face all kinds of persecution because of “my </p>
<p>name” (15:21). e name of Jesus is the name of God given to him to ex-</p>
<p>hibit his glory to humanity. e world’s hatred of Jesus and his disciples is </p>
<p>due to its ignorance of the Father, who sent him to the world to reveal the </p>
<p>unknown God. If the world hates Jesus, it hates his Father also (15:23). It </p>
<p>is impossible to experience God the Father without experiencing Jesus the </p>
<p>Son. In this oneness the believers also participate (15:1–11). erefore the </p>
<p>world persecutes the church as it persecuted Jesus. </p>
<p>Jesus argues both in 15:22 and 15:24 that people who are of the world </p>
<p>have no excuse for their sin (cf. Rom 1:20–21). If Jesus had not come and </p>
<p>manifested God by his words received from him (3:34; 8:26, 28; 12:49), </p>
<p>then humans cannot be held accountable for their sin and ignorance of </p>
<p>God. However, since God has spoken through his Son to the world per-</p>
<p>suading it to come out of darkness to the Light, the people cannot say that </p>
<p>they are without sin in rejecting Jesus. e statement “ey have no excuse </p>
<p>for their sin” echoes God’s judgment in the last day (cf. Rom 2:15–16), but </p>
<p>the particles “but now” (15:22) attest the present reality of God’s judgment </p>
<p>against human sin. e Johannine Jesus puts forward also his works as evi-</p>
<p>dence for the world’s permanent guilt (15:24). Jesus’ works, including his </p>
<p>signs, demonstrated God’s glory to human beings, but yet the world did not </p>
<p>believe. If Jesus did not perform the works that no human had done, then </p>
<p>people could not have seen the God who worked through Jesus and they </p>
<p>would not be guilty of sin (cf. 9:41). But people have seen God revealing </p>
<p>himself in Jesus, yet still they hated Jesus and the Father. As Jesus and his </p>
<p>Father are one, his words and works are those of the Father (5:36; 14:10). </p>
<p>By not acknowledging Jesus, then, humankind has rejected both of them.</p>
