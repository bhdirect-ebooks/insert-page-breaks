<p>Jesus’ Reign from the Cross</p>
<p>188</p>
<p>a new family of God, incepted at the cross,</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>in which men and women have</p>
<p>equal roles to play. </p>
<p>Aer symbolically making his newly founded community stabilized </p>
at the cross, by his divine knowledge, Jesus knew that all was now accom-
<p>plished (4:34; 17:4)</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>and said, “I thirst,” to fulll the Scriptures (19:28).</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of soldiers who gave Jesus vinegar or savor wine, </p>
<p>the saying may be an enactment of Pss 69:21 and 22:15 (cf. Ps 42:2; 63:1). </p>
<p>Ironically, the one who gives water that will never make one thirsty (4:14) </p>
<p>says on the cross, “I thirst!” Jesus denitely must have been thirsty physi-</p>
<p>cally in the process of crucixion. It proves that Jesus was really a human </p>
<p>(cf. 4:6–7). John species that there was a vessel with vinegar in the midst, </p>
<p>implying that it was customary to keep sour wine or vinegar in the place of </p>
<p>crucixion to quench the thirst of those crucied. When the soldiers put </p>
<p>a sponge full of vinegar on the hyssop and held it to Jesus’ mouth, perhaps </p>
<p>to mock at him (Mark 15:36), there is no reference that Jesus drank it (cf. </p>
<p>Mark 15:23). is means that Jesus’ thirst was not so much for water as for </p>
<p>God and for God’s cup of suering and death (18:11) to be drunk.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>e reference to “hyssop” is deliberate in John. It was a small plant </p>
<p>whose stem is not lengthy.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>It is possible that the sponge of vinegar was</p>
<p>tied in the hyssop and held to Jesus’ mouth by a reed (cf. Matt 27:48; Mark </p>
<p>15:36). Hyssop reminds that Jesus is the Passover Lamb (cf. 18:28; 19:36), </p>
<p>for the Israelites sprinkled on their doorposts by dipping hyssop in the </p>
<p>blood of the Passover lamb when they were delivered from bondage (Exod </p>
<p>12:21–22). Aer receiving the vinegar, Jesus saw that he has fullled God’s </p>
<p>redemptive plan for humanity and said victoriously, “It has been nished,” </p>
<p>the last word before his death in John (19:30a). e purpose of Jesus’ com-</p>
ing into the world was to give divine life to human beings, by bearing their
<p>sins on the cross, and to establish a new humanity (1:29; 3:16–17; 4:34; </p>
<p>5:36; 10:10; 17:4). Jesus made “the prince of the world” powerless on the </p>
<p>cross (12:31; 14:30; 16:11). He completed all these functions successfully!</p>
<p>Aer Jesus’ word of victory, he bowed his head and handed over his </p>
<p>spirit (19:30b). Neither “the Jews” nor the Roman soldiers took away Jesus’ </p>
<p>life, but he himself handed over his spirit, obviously to the Father (Matt </p>
<p>19. Cf. Koester 2003: 239–41.</p>
<p>20. is shows that the purpose of Jesus’ coming into the world goes beyond his gi </p>
<p>of salvation to form God’s new community.</p>
