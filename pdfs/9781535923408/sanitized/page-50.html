<p>Jesus’ Public Ministry</p>

<p>to face judgment (cf. 4:21; 5:25, 28–29; 16:2, 25).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>us, at the deeper level</p>
<p>“my hour” in 2:4 means that the Father’s time to reveal Jesus’ glory through </p>
<p>his death and resurrection has not yet come. </p>
<p>Gaining condence from Jesus’ response, his mother instructed the </p>
<p>servants, “You do what he would tell you” (2:5). She acted with an exem-</p>
<p>plary faith and with determination to supply wine through Jesus. However, </p>
<p>his disciples were so passive that they were unable to recognize the need of </p>
<p>the time.</p>
<p>Jesus started acting in his own time as per God’s will. He wished to </p>
<p>supply better quality of wine by using the water kept in six stone jars, as </p>
<p>per the Jewish rite of purication, each jar containing 80–120 liters (2:6 </p>
<p>TNIV).</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>e use of “stone jars” for purication is mentioned not in Lev</p>
<p>11:32–38, but in the Mishnah, a Rabbinic text of the second century that </p>
<p>reects the life situation of the late rst century (m. Kelim 5:11; m. Besah </p>
<p>2:3). He asked the servants to ll the jars with water up to the brim and they </p>
<p>did it (2:7). In obedience to Jesus’ instruction, they drew some water out </p>
<p>and took it to the master of the feast (2:7–8).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>e text does not mention when the water drawn out of jars was </p>
<p>turned into wine. We are only told that the master of the feast tasted the </p>
<p>“water which had become wine” without knowing where it was from (2:9). </p>
<p>e Greek perfect-tense gegenēmenon shows the quality of the water, which </p>
<p>perhaps had already become wine before it came to the hands of the master. </p>
<p>e water became wine probably when the servants were drawing it from </p>
<p>the jars or when they were carrying it. ey knew by whom the miracle </p>
<p>happened, but not how it happened (2:9). ere is a secrecy motif in this </p>
<p>rst sign of Jesus (2:11a), conveying the truth that the miraculous deeds </p>
<p>of Jesus are beyond human comprehension. e focus of the sign, then, is </p>
<p>not on how or when the turning of water into wine happened but on why </p>
<p>it happened. </p>
<p>is sign also contains non-understanding, a literary feature of John. </p>
<p>e master of the feast misunderstood the supply of “good wine” as the </p>
<p>work of the bridegroom. Hence he told the bridegroom that he was keep-</p>
<p>ing thus far the good wine in contrast to the usual custom of oering the </p>
<p>6. Cf. Brown 1978: 1.517.</p>
<p>7. John gives the capacity of each jar as “two or three measures,” one “measure” being </p>
<p>equivalent to almost forty liters, and thus six jars will hold 480–720 liters; Schnackenburg </p>
<p>1980–84: 1.332; Ridderbos 1997: 107.</p>
<p>8. e Greek word architriklinos means “head waiter, butler” or, more aptly to the </p>
<p>context, “master of the feast”; BDAG, 139.</p>
