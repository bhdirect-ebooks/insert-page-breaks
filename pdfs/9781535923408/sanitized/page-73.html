<p>John 4:7–26</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>e woman, who had believed in the coming Messiah, now speaks of </p>
<p>the Messiah, who will come and declare everything related to the temple </p>
<p>and worship (4:25). e Samaritans believed that the coming Messiah, the </p>
<p>taheb, as the spokesman for God, would reveal the truth by declaring the </p>
divine will.
<p>13</p>
<p>As Jesus was declaring the things connected with worship, the</p>
<p>belief dawned within her that Jesus could perhaps be that Messiah. As Jesus </p>
<p>perceived her inner mind and also foreknew that his dialogue with her was </p>
<p>reaching its culmination, he eventually revealed himself to her as the Mes-</p>
<p>siah by saying, “I, I am, the one who is speaking to you” (4:26). </p>
<p>In John the word “I am,” used by Jesus for himself, indicates that he </p>
<p>is the Christ, the revelation of the one God who is “I am that I am” (Exod </p>
<p>3:13–14). e prophet Isaiah uses this name to arm both the uniqueness </p>
<p>of Yahweh in relation to all other gods of Babylon and his relationship with </p>
<p>his people as their God (Isa 41:4; 42:8; 43:10, 11, 13, 15, 25). By saying, “I </p>
<p>am he,” Jesus expresses his uniqueness in comparison with other deities of </p>
<p>the Samaritans, as the Messiah in whom the only God revealed himself. </p>
<p>Jesus, the bearer of God’s presence, is the place where one can worship God. </p>
<p>Jesus, as the new Temple, replaces the Jewish temple in Jerusalem and also </p>
<p>the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> Although the woman’s percep-</p>
<p>tion of Jesus attains its climax now, at rst she had only a tentative belief in </p>
<p>his messiahship.</p>
<p>Jesus’ injunction on his disciples’ mission (4:27–38)</p>
<p>While Jesus was revealing his identity as the Christ, his disciples came back </p>
<p>to him with food. When they saw their teacher talking alone with a woman, </p>
<p>they were astonished, but no one had the courage to question Jesus about </p>
<p>why he was conversing with a Samaritan woman or what his needs were </p>
<p>(4:27). Jewish custom prohibited rabbis from talking with women, even </p>
<p>with their own wives, in public places (m. Nid. 4:1). At this time the woman </p>
<p>dramatically goes away from the scene. In her extreme enthusiasm of hav-</p>
<p>ing met with the Messiah, she forgot all about the earthly water and le her </p>
<p>water jar at the well to go to her people in the city (4:28). She went away to </p>
<p>call her people to come and see whether or not the man who supernaturally </p>
<p>disclosed her life history could be the Messiah (4:29).</p>

<p>14. Kanagaraj 2005: 152. For the rst time in the Gospel Jesus reveals himself by the </p>
<p>name of God, “I am (he),” to a woman, a Samaritan hated by the Jews.</p>
