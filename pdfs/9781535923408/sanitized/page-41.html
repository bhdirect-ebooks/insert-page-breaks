<p>John 1:29–34</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Christ, Jesus, who was coming toward the Baptist (1:29). ere is no refer-</p>
<p>ence in this section either to the audience to whom Jesus was introduced or </p>
<p>to his baptism. Perhaps John intended the audience to be anyone who reads </p>
<p>it. e Baptist bears witness to Jesus as “the Lamb of God, who removes the </p>
<p>sin of the world.”</p>
<p>e book of Revelation (5:6, 8, 12, 13; 6:16; 7:9–10, 14, 17; 22:1, 3) </p>
<p>refers to “the Lamb.” However, there Greek word used for “lamb” (arnion) </p>
<p>is dierent from what is used in John (amnos), though there is not much </p>
<p>essential dierence.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>ere are three OT references to the “Lamb of God”</p>
<p>(Gen 22:8; Exod 12:3–6; Isa 53:7). In Isaac’s sacrice (Gen 22) there is no </p>
<p>reference to the removal of sin, although it pregures Jesus’ death and res-</p>
<p>urrection (cf. John 3:16; Heb 11:17–19). </p>
<p>Exodus 12 may give a possible background to John 1:29, since Jesus </p>
<p>was identied in Christian circles as the Lamb of God in whose death </p>
<p>people receive deliverance just like the people of Israel were delivered from </p>
<p>Egyptian bondage by the oering of the paschal lamb (cf. 19:36 with Exod </p>
<p>12:46 and Num 9:12; 1 Cor 5:7). However, Isa 53:4–7 gives a relevant back-</p>
<p>ground to interpret “the Lamb of God” in John 1:29, 36. Just like the Servant </p>
<p>of the Lord who would heal people by carrying their sorrows and sins (Isa </p>
<p>53:4–6), by oering himself for sin (Isa 53:10), and by pouring his soul to </p>
<p>death (Isa 53:12), so also Jesus will take away human sin by pouring himself </p>
<p>out to death on the cross. His death will bring deliverance for people from </p>
<p>their suering and eternal destruction. us, the Baptist witnesses to Jesus </p>
<p>as the Lamb who will be slaughtered on the cross for human sin to bring </p>
<p>salvation for all who believe. e readers can see a shadow of the cross in </p>
<p>the Baptist’s witness.</p>
<p>Aer publicly acknowledging the superiority of the man Jesus in rank </p>
<p>and status as the one who was existing before him (cf. 1:15, 27; 8:58), the </p>
<p>Baptist acknowledges twice his ignorance of the identity of Christ, the Son </p>
<p>of God (1:31, 33). He states that he came to baptize people with water so </p>
<p>that the pre-existent Christ might be revealed to Israel (1:31). e term </p>
<p>“Israel” could refer to the Jews who will believe and accept the God-sent </p>
<p>Messiah, in contrast to “the Jews” in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>e Baptist could identify that it is Jesus who is the Son of God when </p>
<p>he saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and remaining on </p>
<p>29. For other arguments against the background of Revelation see Ridderbos 1997: </p>
<p>72; Keener 2005: 1.452.</p>
