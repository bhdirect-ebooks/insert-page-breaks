<p>John 3:13–21</p>

<p>of darkness (12:47). But the reason for eternal condemnation is the refusal </p>
<p>to believe in the name of the only Son (cf. 1:12). Unbelief is the root of all </p>
<p>evil deeds (cf. 16:9).</p>
<p>John refers to the descent of the Son of Man to the world (3:13–15), </p>
<p>and then he speaks of the sending/giving of the Son to the world (3:16–18), </p>
<p>and in 3:19–21 he speaks of the coming of the Light into the world (cf. </p>
<p>1:9–11)—all denoting the coming of Jesus into the world. In 3:19–21, John </p>
<p>describes the Logos incarnate, Jesus, as the Light who came into the world </p>
<p>(cf. 8:12; 9:5; 12:35–36, 46). Since human works are naturally evil, all people </p>
<p>love to live in darkness rather than in light. erefore they themselves fall </p>
<p>under God’s judgment (3:19), an eschatological event that is in operation </p>
<p>at present (3:18; 5:24). e Light not only shines and illumines (1:5, 9), but </p>
<p>also exposes the evil deeds of humankind and therefore the world hates the </p>
<p>Light and does not come to it (3:20).</p>
<p>In contrast, those who do the truth are recognized as those who love </p>
<p>the Light and live in it (3:21). ey exhibit their faithfulness to the covenant </p>
<p>relationship of God by obeying his commandments. Doing good deeds is </p>
<p>the same as doing the truth by living in the Light and in fellowship with </p>
God (cf. Matt 5:16). e coming of Jesus thus divides human beings into
<p>those who love darkness and perform evil and those who come to the Light </p>
and perform good deeds (cf. 1QS 3.1—4.26). Nevertheless, the division was
<p>caused not by the coming of Jesus into the world but by the response of the </p>
<p>people to his coming. </p>
<p>The Baptist’s testimony to Jesus (3:22–30) </p>
<p>e phrase “aer these” (3:22) links the mission of the Baptist with the </p>
<p>mission of the Son of God (3:16–21). Aer Jesus’ ministry in Jerusalem, </p>
<p>Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean land, where he was staying </p>
<p>with them and baptizing. Since Jesus was already in Judea, his move into </p>
<p>the land of Judea seems irrelevant. erefore some scholars suggest that </p>
<p>3:22–30 should be read aer 2:12 and that 3:1–21 should be followed by </p>
<p>verses 31–36. However, the word “land of Judea” can also mean “Judean </p>
<p>countryside” (NRSV and ESV).</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Jesus and his disciples might have moved</p>
<p>from Jerusalem into the countryside, where water was available for bap-</p>
<p>tism. Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples were (4:2). </p>
<p>7. e meaning of the Greek gē in 3:22 is “region, country” (BDAG, 196).</p>
