<p>who had corrupted Jewish religion with unacceptable practices.</p>

<p>Obviously</p>
<p>the Samaritans could not be fully regarded as Jews. e destruction of the </p>
<p>Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim by John Hyrcanus, the Hasmonean </p>
<p>ruler, in 128 BCE deepened the hatred between the Jews and Samaritans. </p>
<p>e Jews perhaps considered the Samaritans as demoniacs (8:48; cf. 7:20). </p>
<p>Since the woman was well aware of such a political and religious back-</p>
ground dividing the Samaritans from Jews, she got astonished at a Jewish
<p>man’s request for water. Initially she, like Nicodemus, understood Jesus </p>
<p>purely at human level.</p>
<p>Jesus turns her attention to heavenly things. He points out her non-</p>
<p>understanding of the person who is asking for water and then discloses </p>
<p>himself as the one who would have given her “living water” had she recog-</p>
<p>nized him as the Christ and asked him (4:10). In the OT, God is described </p>
<p>as the “fountain of living waters” from which his people would have re-</p>
<p>ceived life had they not forsaken him (Jer 2:13; 17:13). e term “living </p>
<p>waters” also denotes the life of the end-time, when God will be King over </p>
<p>all the earth (Zech 14:8–9). is implies that the gi of God Jesus identies </p>
<p>as “living water” is eternal life, a life with God in heaven, and that it has a </p>
<p>owing nature.</p>
<p>In John “water” mostly symbolizes the Holy Spirit, who gives heavenly </p>
<p>life as a present possession and also as future life with God to those who </p>
<p>believe in Jesus (John 3:3, 5, 8; 7:37–39; cf. 19:34; 20:22; 1QS 4.21). e </p>
<p>water Jesus gives is the life of the Holy Spirit, which, as a spring, wells up </p>
<p>to eternal life (4:14), the eschatological life that is available even now. Jesus </p>
<p>encourages the Samaritan woman to believe in him as the one who comes </p>
<p>from God and as the fountain of living waters that gives heavenly life. Such </p>
<p>life satises the one who receives it so that they have no further thirst. Even </p>
<p>death cannot overcome this life (cf. 11:25b–26a).</p>
<p>e woman questioned the greatness of Jesus by asking where he </p>
<p>could get the living water, as Jesus had nothing to draw water from and this </p>
<p>well’s depth could have been around a hundred feet?</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Was he greater than</p>
<p>“our father” Jacob, who gave this well and drank water out of this himself, </p>
<p>his sons and his cattle? (4:11–12). Both questions are ironic in the sense </p>
<p>that Jesus’ power to give life and his greater status than that of Jacob are </p>
<p>unknowingly confessed by a Samaritan woman. Jesus gives to the one who </p>
<p>believes in him the rivers of living water (7:37–39), and he is greater than </p>
