<p>John 11:1–16</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>Aer hearing of Lazarus’ sickness, Jesus comments that Lazarus’ </p>
<p>sickness is not unto death. Although he foreknew that Lazarus would die </p>
<p>(11:11, 14), for him death will have no power over Lazarus, because Jesus </p>
<p>will raise him up to life to manifest God’s glory. In the manifestation of </p>
<p>God’s glory, the Son of God will be gloried (11:4).</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Whatever glories God</p>
<p>glories Jesus also (13:31–32). Jesus’ raising of Lazarus, the seventh sign in </p>
<p>John, will demonstrate God’s life-giving power and also will lead to Jesus’ </p>
<p>arrest, suering, and death on the cross (11:46–53), where God’s glory will </p>
<p>be manifested in Jesus.</p>
<p>Out of his love for Martha, Mary, and Lazarus, Jesus stayed two more </p>
<p>days in his place even aer he learned that Lazarus was ill (11:5–6). is </p>
<p>delay is due to Jesus’ commitment to work in God’s time so that God’s glory </p>
<p>may be revealed magnicently in human powerlessness and that his dis-</p>
<p>ciples may believe in him (11:15, 40, 42, 45; cf. 11:48). Aer two days, Jesus, </p>
<p>as the mark of his willingness to be put to death, said, “Let us go into Judea </p>
<p>again” (11:7). In response, his disciples, who understood the circumstances </p>
<p>in human terms, said, “Rabbi, the Jews were now seeking to stone you, and </p>
<p>are you going there again?” (11:8). ey knew what happened at the feast of </p>
<p>the Dedication (10:31) and so wanted to protect Jesus’ life.</p>
<p>Jesus responded in terms of metaphors: “day,” implying light, and </p>
<p>“night,” implying darkness. His counter-question, “Are there not twelve </p>
<p>hours in the day?,” expects the answer “yes” (11:9a). e twelve hours </p>
<p>from sunrise to sunset has enough light so that no one may stumble on the </p>
<p>way. In contrast, those who perform activities at night stumble on the way </p>
<p>due to the dominating darkness and absence of light in them. e meta-</p>
<p>phor means, at the natural level, that in the sunlight, available at daytime, </p>
<p>peoples’ works are exposed and they nd their direction, but that at night, </p>
<p>when there is darkness, they cannot work and nd their way to reach their </p>
<p>destination (cf. 9:4). However, at the supernatural level, it means that Jesus </p>
<p>is the Light of the world (8:12; 9:5) in whose light peoples’ deeds are ex-</p>
<p>posed (3:20–21) and that his absence will cause darkness in the world. As </p>
<p>a result, people become ignorant of Jesus and keep doing evil (3:19–20). </p>
<p>Jesus’ statements on walking in the day and walking in the night (11:9b-10) </p>
<p>have ethical connotations, as the verb “to walk” shows, and therefore make </p>
<p>a supernatural meaning possible. at is, the time appointed by the Father </p>
<p>for Jesus to depart from the world is fast approaching and he must go to </p>
<p>Judea to face suering and death. erefore, Jesus exhorted them to believe </p>
<p>2. e title “Son of God” is used only in 11:4 to denote the glorication of Jesus.</p>
