<p>John 15:1–17</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>to live in union with Jesus and bear much fruit. Just as God, the owner of </p>
<p>the vineyard and planter of the vine, judges Israel by looking for its fruit, </p>
<p>so also he does in the new community centered on Jesus.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>e Father thus</p>
<p>plays active role to keep his community in his Son.</p>
<p>Jesus encourages his disciples that they have already been made clean </p>
<p>by the “word” he spoke to them (15:3). is “word,” which is Jesus’ message </p>
<p>of salvation, is the Father’s word (8:28; 12:49; 14:24), which sancties Jesus’ </p>
<p>disciples (17:17). However, they are asked to maintain their given purity by </p>
<p>always remaining in Jesus, as Jesus remains in them (15:4a). “Abiding in” </p>
<p>and “bearing fruit” are inseparable. e mutual union will keep the disciples </p>
<p>clean and enable them to yield fruit, which is nothing but reproducing the </p>
<p>life of Jesus. Just as sap ows from the vine to all its branches, making them </p>
<p>to yield fruit, so also the life of Jesus ows from him to all those who are </p>
<p>attached with him by faith. It is a progressive act that, without deication of </p>
<p>the believers, shows Jesus to the world by good works. </p>
<p>Jesus’ followers, as branches, cannot reproduce his life unless they </p>
<p>remain in him, the vine, and he in them (15:5). e term “the branches” </p>
<p>conrms the community motif underlying in John. e members of God’s </p>
<p>chosen community should be so linked with Jesus that his life may ow </p>
<p>through them to show him to society. “Abiding in Jesus” may denote our </p>
<p>hidden life that is rooted in private prayers and meditation on God’s Word.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Apart from me you cannot do anything” implies that we cannot reect </p>
<p>Jesus’ character and work by living independent of him. If anyone lives </p>
<p>independent of Jesus, that person is cast forth and withers. All those who </p>
<p>do not live in union with him will eventually be destroyed, just like the </p>
<p>branches that are not linked with the vine are gathered, thrown into the </p>
<p>re, and burnt (15:6; cf. Matt 13:41–42). e passive voice used implies that </p>
<p>God is the agent of casting out the fruitless branches. e language used in </p>
<p>15:6 indicates the nal judgment of God (Matt 3:10; 7:19; 13:40, 42, 50). </p>
<p>is warning underlines the urgency to live in union with Jesus by obeying </p>
<p>his word (8:31; 15:7, 9) and by appropriating his life that ows from the </p>
<p>cross (6:56).</p>
<p>If Jesus’ words abide in Jesus’ followers, as they abide in Jesus, what-</p>
<p>ever they wish will be done for them (15:7; cf. 14:13–14). e more they </p>
<p>obey Jesus’ words, the more they become intimate with him. In their daily </p>
<p>communion with Jesus through his words, a blending of wills takes place</p>
