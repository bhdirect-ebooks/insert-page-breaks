<p>Foundation of the Community of Faith</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>“Are you the prophet?,” perhaps having in mind Deut 18:15 and 18, which </p>
<p>speak of a prophet like Moses whom God will raise up. It is unlikely that the </p>
<p>delegates had in mind the prophet mentioned in Qumran writings (4QTest </p>
<p>5–8; 1QS 9.11), as the Qumran community separated itself by revolting </p>
<p>against Jerusalem priests and their cultic practices. ere is no evidence </p>
<p>that, besides Elijah and a Moses-like prophet, the Jews were expecting any </p>
<p>other gure as the eschatological prophet. Nor do we have evidence that </p>
<p>John’s community identied Christ with a prophet-like gure.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> Aer stat-</p>
<p>ing that he was not the prophet either, the Baptist explains his mission as </p>
<p>preparing the way for the coming of the Lord (“Christ”). He was nothing </p>
<p>but a voice that cried out in the wilderness in order to purify and prepare a </p>
<p>group of people for God by declaring the coming of Christ, as the Scripture </p>
<p>testies (Isa 40:3; cf. Matt 3:3 par.).</p>
<p>e enquiry of the agents gives an opportunity for the Baptist to proj-</p>
<p>ect Jesus’ greatness as the Christ who is present among them but hidden to </p>
<p>their eyes (1:26–27).</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>Without comparing his baptism with that of Jesus</p>
<p>(Matt 3:11 par.), the Baptist discloses the spiritual blindness of the religious </p>
<p>leaders, who, by this time, should have rightly understood such scriptural </p>
<p>passages as Isa 40:3 and Mal 3:1; 4:5–6. Although Jesus came to the human </p>
<p>scene chronologically aer the Baptist (cf. 1:15), the latter acknowledges </p>
<p>Jesus’ greatness by stating, “the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to </p>
<p>untie.” In a teacher-disciple relationship in rabbinic circles, a menial job </p>
<p>such as untying the thong of a teacher’s sandals was not assigned to any of </p>
<p>his pupils and still less to a slave.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> e Baptist acknowledges his unworthi-</p>
<p>ness even to be a slave to Jesus, who is the Christ, the Son of God (1:34), for </p>
<p>Jesus’ mission of bringing salvation to humankind by his death and resur-</p>
<p>rection surpasses any human enterprise.</p>
<p>Content of the Baptist’s witness (1:29–34) </p>
<p>In 1:29–34, the Baptist unveils who Jesus is and implicitly what he will ac-</p>
<p>complish. For the rst time the name “Jesus” appears in 1:29 aer 1:17. e </p>
<p>day aer the enquiry of Jerusalem leaders, John gives a picture of the real </p>
<p>26. John 6:14; 7:40; 9:17 do not prove that the Johannine community had developed </p>
<p>a prophet Christology.</p>
<p>27. is reects the current belief that the Messiah is concealed in the presence of </p>
<p>God’s power from the beginning (1 En. 62:7; 4 Ezra 13:2–4, 52; Dan 7:13–14).</p>
