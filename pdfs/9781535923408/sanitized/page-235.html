<p>shore, but were about a two hundred cubits (a hundred yards) away so that </p>
<p>they could not miss Jesus’ words (21:8).</p>
<p>e reference in Jesus’ instruction to the “right side” (cf. Luke 5:4) </p>
<p>may have the notion of favorable side, but the point of Jesus’ command is </p>
<p>that obedience to his words alone will bring success. e disciples cast the </p>
<p>net on the right side and got such a large quantity of sh that they could </p>
<p>not draw it in (21:6b). Eventually, the other disciples, besides Peter, dragged </p>
<p>the net full of sh nearer to the shore. us, the man on the shore revealed </p>
<p>himself as the risen Jesus who is known by the name of God, “the Lord.” </p>
<p>e close relationship between the beloved disciple and Peter comes into </p>
<p>focus, for the disciple whom Jesus loved identies Jesus and reveals it to </p>
<p>Peter, rather than to any other disciples, that it is the Lord (21:7). e sign </p>
<p>reminded him of the same Jesus who was living on earth along with them </p>
<p>by bearing God’s name (e.g., John 6:16–21; Luke 5:1–11). </p>
<p>On hearing that it was the Lord, Peter wrapped his outer garment </p>
<p>around himself, as he was naked, and threw himself into the sea. at Peter </p>
<p>was naked does not necessarily mean that he was without any garment. He </p>
<p>could have been wearing customarily a small undergarment at the time </p>
<p>of shing. Possibly, Peter could have thrown himself into the water with </p>
<p>a guilty conscience that although he himself saw the empty tomb and the </p>
<p>risen Jesus, he returned to his job. While we have reference to the other </p>
<p>disciples who reached the land with a net full of sh (21:8), there is no ref-</p>
<p>erence to the means by which Peter reached the shore; probably by swim-</p>
<p>ming. Later it is Peter who got into the boat and hauled the net full of sh </p>
<p>ashore (21:11). It is likely that Peter reached the shore before others and </p>
<p>met Jesus. </p>
<p>Aer the disciples got out on land, they saw a charcoal re already lit </p>
<p>on the beach with grilled sh laid on it and bread beside it (21:9). e risen </p>
<p>Lord took the initiative to provide food for his loved ones. ere is no hint </p>
<p>that Jesus used any of the sh caught, though he told them to bring some of </p>
<p>sh caught (21:10). Since they saw the sh and bread awaiting them, they </p>
<p>simply le the net full of sh on the shore. Jesus’ initiative to give food and </p>
<p>his invitation to come and have breakfast (21:12a) are not merely to satisfy </p>
<p>his hungry disciples, but to reveal his continuing love and communion with </p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>When Jesus asked the disciples to bring some of the sh that they had </p>
<p>caught, Simon Peter responded by going up into the boat and drawing the </p>
<p>net, full of 153 great sh, ashore. e narrator comments that although </p>
