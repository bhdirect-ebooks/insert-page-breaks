<p>JOHN 7</p>
<p>Is Jesus the Christ?: Conﬂict with “the Jews”</p>
<p>John 7 is apparently Jesus’ continuous response to the accusation raised by </p>
<p>the Jewish authorities in John 5. We have in it Jesus’ words spoken at the </p>
<p>feast of Tabernacles, and then his words spoken at the feast of the Dedica-</p>
<p>tion follow in John 10. On each occasion, the conict between Jesus and </p>
<p>the Jewish authorities is intensied so as to bring him nearer to the cross. </p>
<p>John 7:53, together with 8:1–11, seems to be a later addition and therefore </p>
<p>it needs to be studied with John 8.</p>
<p>Jesus, his brothers, and “the Jews” (7:1–13) </p>
<p>“Aer this” gives a transition from one narrative to another without chron-</p>
<p>ological sequence (cf. 5:1; 6:1). Jesus foreknew that “the Jews” were seeking </p>
<p>to kill him and therefore, deciding against going to Judea, he continued </p>
<p>his ministry in Galilee (7:1; cf. 4:1, 3). e Jewish feast of Tabernacles had </p>
<p>arrived (7:2; cf. 2:13; 6:4; 11:55). is feast, known also as the “festival of </p>
<p>Booths,” was celebrated in late September as “a most holy and most emi-</p>
<p>nent feast” (Ant. 8.4.1). It commemorated the time when the Israelites lived </p>
<p>in booths in the wilderness (Lev 23:33–43). At this feast, the ark of the </p>
<p>covenant of the Lord and all the vessels in the tent were brought into Solo-</p>
<p>mon’s temple from Zion and therefore it came to be known as the “feast of </p>
<p>Tabernacles” (1 Kgs 8:1–8). Water and light were dominant themes in the </p>
<p>feast of Tabernacles, expressing the ritual libation with the water drawn </p>
<p>from Siloam (m. Sukkah 4:9) and the illumination of the temple with lights </p>
<p>(m. Sukkah 5:1–4).</p>

<p>Jesus’ brothers urged him to go to Judea and show himself to his dis-</p>
<p>ciples by doing the works he was doing in Galilee. By saying that no one </p>
<p>works in secret if he would become popular, they tempted him to show </p>
<p>himself to “the world” (the Roman world at large). Even his brothers did </p>
