<p>John 12:27–36</p>

<p>Satan (13:27).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>He causes people to do evil against Jesus and his followers</p>
<p>(e.g., 8:44; 13:2). Humans can be liberated from evil, when the “ruler of </p>
<p>this world” is cast out by Jesus’ power generated from his death and resur-</p>
<p>rection. By using the present “now” and the future “shall be cast out,” John </p>
<p>merges into one the present eect of Jesus’ crucixion to make the devil </p>
<p>powerless and to annihilate him at the end-time (Rev 12:9; 20:10).</p>
<p>With an emphatic “I” Jesus then says, “And I, when I am lied up </p>
<p>from the earth, will draw all to myself.” “To be lied up” implies “to be </p>
<p>exalted, gloried” (Isa 52:13), and it echoes Moses’ liing up of the serpent </p>
<p>to give life to the dying (Num 21:9; 3:14–15). Jesus will be lied up on a </p>
<p>pole by crucixion, the Roman form of execution. From the cross, Jesus </p>
<p>will draw all people unto himself to form a new community (12:32). “All </p>
<p>people” bears the universal eect of Jesus’ death. It is the Father who draws </p>
<p>all those who believe in Jesus lied up on the cross (cf. 6:44, 37). e nar-</p>
<p>rator explains plainly that by “being lied up” Jesus means the nature of his </p>
<p>death, that is, by crucixion (12:33).</p>
<p>e crowd seems to have understood the term “being lied up” as </p>
<p>denoting Jesus’ death. erefore they asked, “We have heard from the Law </p>
<p>that the Christ remains for ever, and how do you say that the Son of Man </p>
<p>must be lied up? Who is this Son of Man?” (12:34). Jesus did not link the </p>
<p>title “Son of Man” here with his being lied up. However, he has already </p>
<p>spoken of the Son of Man being gloried (12:23) by being lied up on the </p>
<p>cross (3:14; 8:28). e people could have heard those words. e “Law” </p>
<p>indicates the OT from which they had known that the Christ will remain </p>
<p>forever. Ps 89:36 reads that David’s ospring (the Christ) shall endure for-</p>
<p>ever and that his throne is established forever (cf. Ps 89:51; cf. 2 Sam 7:1; </p>
<p>Gal 3:16). A messianic psalm has, “You are a priest for ever” (Ps 110:4). e </p>
<p>Jewish crowd might have thought of such verses.</p>
<p>ere is an intermingling of two christological titles in 12:34: Christ </p>
<p>and the Son of Man. e crowd obviously identies the Christ with the Son </p>
<p>of Man, for when Jesus speaks of the death of the Son of Man the crowd </p>
<p>responds that Christ remains forever. In the late rst century, some Jews </p>
<p>identied the Son of Man with the pre-existent Messiah, the Elect One of </p>
<p>God, who would be on the throne of glory and render judgment (1 En. 45:3; </p>
<p>51:3; 55:4; 61:8; cf. 48:6; 49; etc.). ey understood the “one like a son of </p>
<p>16. He is the personied power of evil, called “Belial” (e.g., 1QM 1.1, 5, 13; 4.2; 11.8; </p>
<p>1QS 1.18, 24; 2.5, 19). In the rst century CE, he was also called “Berial” or “Beliar” </p>
<p>(Ascen. Isa. 2:4) and “the prince of the world” (Ascen. Isa. 1:3; 10:9); Schnackenb<span class="_ _0" />urg </p>
