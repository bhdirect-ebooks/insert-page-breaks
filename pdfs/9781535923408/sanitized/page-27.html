<p>Jesus’ story.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> If so, then it is dicult to explain some of the outward dier-</p>
<p>ences found between the Synoptic Gospels and the Fourth Gospel. </p>
<p>Another view is that John’s primary purpose was to replace the Syn-</p>
<p>optic Gospels by producing a Gospel par excellence that would render the </p>
<p>others superuous and would eventually drive them out of circulation. is </p>
<p>idea appears dimly in the Muratorian Canon (ca. 200 CE).</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>However, John</p>
<p>widely uses the Gospel tradition, some of which appears in the Synoptic </p>
<p>Gospels, in his writing and there is no clue that he wished to supersede </p>
<p>the already existing Gospels. If he had planned so, then his omission of </p>
<p>such key passages as the birth of Jesus, the Sermon on the Mount/Plain, the </p>
<p>Synoptic parables, etc. becomes inexplicable. </p>
<p>Another theory supports the polemical purpose of John. Irenaeus ar-</p>
<p>gued that John’s Gospel was written to refute the rising heresies of the Nico-</p>
<p>laitans and Cerinthians.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>One can feel the polemical purpose of John when</p>
<p>he emphasizes that the pre-existent Word became “esh,” without using the </p>
<p>word “man” or “body” (1:14; cf. 6:51–56), and that John the Baptist was nei-</p>
<p>ther the Light (1:8) nor the Christ (1:20), but was only a “lamp” (5:35) who </p>
<p>came to bear witness to the Light. John’s teaching on Jesus’ oneness with the </p>
<p>Father (5:18; 10:30; 12:44–45; 14:9–11; 17:21–23; 20:28) and equally on his </p>
<p>subordination to the Father (5:19–23; 8:16, 28–29; 12:49; 14:28) can better </p>
<p>be understood as a polemic against the prevailing heresies about the person </p>
<p>Jesus. It seems, however, that John goes beyond this polemic purpose.</p>
<p>John himself categorically states his purpose: “But these things have </p>
<p>been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of </p>
<p>God, and that as you believe, you may have life in his name” (20:31). e </p>
<p>primary purpose of John, then, is to proclaim the gospel that in Jesus one </p>
can experience divine life and to persuade his readers to believe in Jesus as
<p>the Christ.</p>
<p>However, the question is: Was the Gospel written to unbelievers or to </p>
<p>those who believed in Jesus? e word “to believe” has two dierent read-</p>
<p>ings, which have equal support in Greek manuscripts (see comment on </p>
<p>20:31). If pisteuēte (“to continue believing”) is read, then John could have </p>
<p>written the Gospel with a didactic purpose to teach young believers to be </p>
<p>steadfast in faith in the wake of increasing heretical teachings and persecu-</p>
<p>tion. Actually the polemic and the didactic purposes go together, for the </p>
<p>28. Eccl. Hist. 6.14.5–7.</p>
<p>29. Santram 1975: 108, 111–12. </p>
<p>30. Cf. Brown 2010: 153–80.</p>
