<p>Introduction</p>
<p>xxiii</p>
<p>refers to a community on whose behalf the editor gave nal shape to the </p>
<p>Gospel. </p>
<p>e authorship of John’s Gospel, then, needs to be placed in at least </p>
<p>three stages of development: in the Johannine community at Ephesus</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>the real author (John the Elder of Judea, who actually wrote the Gospel), </p>
<p>the implied/ideal author (the Beloved Disciple, who could probably be John </p>
<p>the Son of Zebedee) whose writings were used, and nally an editor from </p>
<p>Johannine community who added explanatory notes and the epilogue.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>When Was John’s Gospel Composed and Published? </p>
<p>Some have argued that John’s Gospel must have been written in the mid </p>
<p>second century. In fact, the rst commentary, at least partly, was written by </p>
<p>a gnostic in 125 CE, and by 173 CE it came to be well established and highly </p>
<p>regarded by, for example, Tatian, as found in his fourfold Gospel harmony, </p>
<p>the Diatessaron.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>e presence of a part of the passion narrative of John</p>
<p>in the second-century CE papyri manuscripts (P</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>, P</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>, P</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>speaks in</p>
<p>favor of the Gospel as in circulation in the early or mid second century </p>
<p>CE. However, the Gospel must have existed some time before it came to be </p>
<p>written in papyrus scrolls aer being circulated in Asia Minor and then in </p>
<p>Palestine and other Christian centers before it came to be known in Egypt. </p>
<p>So Barrett argues that a date around 110 CE may be placed as the extreme </p>
<p>limit for the composition of the Gospel, while 140 CE may be considered as </p>
<p>the extreme limit for its publication.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> P</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>, dated about 130 CE, makes us </p>
<p>hesitant to conclude that John was written aer 110 CE.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Dodd detected the earliest tradition (the Synoptic tradition) in John’s </p>
<p>Gospel,</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> while Robinson argued for the procedural priority of John’s Gos-</p>
<p>pel.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>e Fourth Gospel contains precise topography, precise chronology,</p>
<p>16. Alexandria, Antioch, and Transjordan are proposed as other possible places for </p>
<p>the composition of John’s Gospel; cf. Brown 2010: 202–6.</p>
<p>17. For the three-person theory see Culpepper 1989: 3–49.</p>
<p>18. Perrin 2010: 301–18, esp. 315.</p>
<p>19. See von Wahlde 2010: 1.7 n. 6.</p>
<p>20. Barrett 1978: 110, 128.</p>
<p>21. So Hengel 1989: 81. More recently Czachesz (Czachesz 2010: 69 n. 75) has reject-</p>
<p>ed that P</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> necessitates a rst-century date for John by uncritically following Nongbri’s.</p>
<p>22. Dodd 1965.</p>
<p>23. Robinson (1985: 3–5) argues for a “procedural” priority of John rather than for a </p>
<p>temporal priority; for him John’s Gospel is the nearest to the source because it is believed </p>
