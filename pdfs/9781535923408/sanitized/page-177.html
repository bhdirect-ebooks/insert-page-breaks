<p>John 14:15–31</p>

<p>future living denotes not merely the Spirit-empowered life soon aer Jesus’ </p>
<p>resurrection, but also the end-time life with him (14:3; 17:24). </p>
<p>Jesus’ resurrection will unveil the tripartite relationship between him-</p>
<p>self and the Father and his followers (“I am in my Father, and you in me, </p>
<p>and I in you”). It will enable them to perceive the mutual indwelling that </p>
<p>exists between the Father, the Son, and the community of believers (14:20). </p>
It is not the believers’ deication, but a collective participation in divine
<p>life (cf. 6:56; 14:17; 15:4; 17:21). is participation brings a responsibility </p>
<p>to God’s community to show their love for Jesus by obeying his command-</p>
<p>ments (cf. 14:15). ose who do so will be loved by the Father and the Son, </p>
<p>and out of love the Son will manifest himself to them (14:21).</p>
<p>Now John introduces another disciple, Judas (not Iscariot), as the </p>
<p>spokesperson (cf. Luke 6:16; Acts 1:13). He asks Jesus, “Lord, how is it that </p>
<p>you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?” (14:22). Judas mis-</p>
<p>understands that Jesus’ self-revelation is conned to the believers alone, </p>
<p>although he came to reveal himself to every human (e.g., 1:9, 18; 3:16; 6:37, </p>
<p>51). Perhaps, like his fellow Jews, Judas longed for the manifestation of the </p>
<p>Messiah in the world.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>But he did not know God’s plan that a handful of</p>
<p>disciples would reach out to the world to bear witness to Jesus and keep </p>
<p>God’s community growing.</p>
<p>In response to Judas’ question, Jesus reiterates that obeying his word </p>
<p>is the mark of one’s love for him. What was told exclusively to his disciples </p>
<p>(14:15) is now made applicable to anyone who would love Jesus (14:23). </p>
<p>“My word” and “my commandments” are essentially the same, denoting </p>
<p>Jesus’ message of salvation (cf. 1 John 3:23). “My Father” will love anyone </p>
<p>who loves Jesus and obeys his word, and both the Father and the Son will </p>
<p>come and make their dwelling with such persons (14:23b). e Jews ex-</p>
<p>pected God to dwell among his people in the age to come (Ezek 37:26–27; </p>
<p>Rev 21:3)</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>. What was expected at the end-time is possible now for anyone </p>
<p>who loves and obeys Jesus. ose who do not love Jesus do not obey his </p>
<p>words and those who disobey Jesus’ words do not love God, for the word </p>
<p>that Jesus speaks is not his, but the Father’s (14:24; cf. 3:34; 8:28b; 14:10; </p>
<p>12:49). </p>
<p>Jesus’ statement “ese things I have spoken to you, while I am dwell-</p>
<p>ing with you” (14:25) introduces two other functions of the Holy Spirit, </p>
<p>whom the Father will send in Jesus’ authority as the bearer of God’s name: </p>
