<p>JOHN 5</p>
<p>Self-Defense of Jesus before His Accusers</p>
<p>John 5 falls within the unit of chapters 5–10, which contains Jesus’ three </p>
<p>signs and the events that took place during four dierent feasts of the Jews. </p>
<p>Holistic healing given to a sick (5:1–18)</p>
<p>“Aer this” introduces Jesus’ movement from one place to another, not nec-</p>
<p>essarily in chronological order (5:1; cf. 6:1; 7:1). Jesus goes up to Jerusalem </p>
<p>for “a feast of the Jews” (5:1). It is puzzling why John did not specify the </p>
<p>feast in 5:1, as he does in 6:4; 7:2; and 10:22. Guilding argues that the feast </p>
<p>in 5:1 is the feast of the new year.</p>

<p>is is probable, for if it meant instead</p>
<p>the feast of Tabernacles, John would have mentioned it, as he does in chap-</p>
<p>ter 7. Whatever the name of the feast is, the focus of the story falls on the </p>
<p>observance of the Sabbath and Jesus’ reinterpretation of the observance by </p>
<p>his sign done in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>John introduces a pool called Bēthzatha in Hebrew.</p>

<p> It was situated at the Sheep Gate in Je-</p>
<p>rusalem (5:2). Although the Greek version reads “at the sheep,” the context </p>
<p>necessitates us to understand it not as “Sheep Pool” but as “Sheep Gate,” </p>
<p>located in the northern part of Jerusalem (Neh 3:1, 32; 12:39). Archaeologi-</p>
<p>cal excavation shows that there were two large pools at the northeast of the </p>
<p>temple, built ca. 200 BCE, and other smaller pools in which people could </p>
<p>bathe. ese two pools had a central partition, which could have been the </p>
<p>central portico, and the other four porticoes may denote two on either side </p>
<p>of the double pool.</p>
