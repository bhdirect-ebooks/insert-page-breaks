<p>John 19:17–30</p>

<p>27:50; Luke 23:46). Strictly speaking, Jesus’ work continues still. He will </p>
<p>send his Spirit (15:26; 16:7) and empower his followers to continue his </p>
<p>work of building up God’s new society (20:21–23). erefore Jesus’ hand-</p>
<p>ing over of his spirit to the Father anticipates his resurrection (10:18) so </p>
that he might give divine life to all who believe in him. us, Jesus’ death
<p>denotes an open-ended mission! </p>
<p>The aftermath of Jesus’ death (19:31–42) </p>
<p>Jesus, the Passover lamb (19:31–37) </p>
<p>In 19:31, “the day of Preparation” means “the day of Preparation of the Sab-</p>
<p>bath,” for John comments that that Sabbath was a “great day.” is means </p>
<p>that for John the next day (6:00 p.m. Friday to 6:00 p.m. Saturday) was the </p>
<p>Sabbath and also the Passover day. erefore it was called “the great day.” </p>
<p>e Jews did not allow the bodies of the crucied to remain hanging on the </p>
<p>cross all night, for a hanged one is cursed by God (Deut 21:22–23; cf. Gal </p>
<p>3:13). It was essential to remove their bodies before the feast day. erefore </p>
<p>the Jewish authorities asked Pilate to break the legs of the crucied ones to </p>
<p>make them die so that their bodies might be removed. Pilate granted their </p>
<p>request. e soldiers came and rst broke the legs of the two who had been </p>
<p>crucied with Jesus (19:32). en they came to Jesus, but they did not break </p>
<p>his legs because they found him already dead (19:33). is special refer-</p>
<p>ence is to separate Jesus from the two criminals. Jesus’ death before his legs </p>
<p>were broken makes the time of his death coincide with the time when the </p>
<p>Passover lambs were sacriced in the temple, at 3:00 p.m. at Jesus’ legs </p>
<p>were not broken fullls the Passover law that the bones of the paschal lamb </p>
<p>should not be broken (Exod 12:46; Num 9:12). </p>
<p>Nevertheless, one of the soldiers, desiring to ensure Jesus’ death, </p>
<p>pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out </p>
<p>(19:34). “Piercing” alludes to Zech 12:10 (cf. John 19:37; Ps 22:16), which </p>
<p>refers to the mourners who will look on him whom they have pierced. e </p>
<p>word “spear” in Greek (logkhē) originally meant an iron spearhead of a </p>
<p>three-and-a-half-foot javelin.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Immediately aer piercing, blood and water</p>
<p>came from Jesus’ side. Medically, the scourging could have caused a hemor-</p>
<p>rhage between Jesus’ ribs and lungs. With Jesus’ body held upright on the </p>
<p>cross, the hemorrhagic uid could have separated into a light serum above </p>
