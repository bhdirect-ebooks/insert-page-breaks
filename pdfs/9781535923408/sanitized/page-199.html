<p>Jesus is the one sent by God (17:21) to give eternal life. With the aim of </p>
<p>expressing Christian unity to the world, the Church of South India was born </p>
<p>by the union of several Protestant churches in south India in September 27, </p>
<p>1947, with the motto, “That they all may be one.” In similar fashion, the </p>
<p>Church of North India came into being in November 29, 1970, with the mot-</p>
<p>to, “Unity–Witness–Service.” The oneness that Jesus envisages is not mere </p>
<p>organizational, doctrinal, and sacramental in nature, but it is the unity of love </p>
<p>(15:9; 17:26), based on the Father’s love for Jesus, and of the Spirit (Eph </p>
<p>4:3). </p>
<p>When Christians were severely persecuted in India in the early part of </p>
<p>the ﬁrst decade of the twenty-ﬁrst century, all churches were united together </p>
<p>to condemn the attacks. There were special meetings and processions to show </p>
<p>Christian solidarity with one another by breaking down the denominational </p>
<p>barriers. Several appeals were made to the concerned authorities to take im-</p>
<p>mediate steps to stop persecuting churches. The unity shown by Christians </p>
<p>prompted other nations to interfere and make appeal to the government to stop </p>
<p>harming Christians and bring justice to those affected. Some Christian lead-</p>
<p>ers wrote in newspapers, magazines, and journals defending Christian faith </p>
in response to a few individuals who wrote against Christians and Christian
<p>faith. Efforts were made through the Minority Commission to take the voice of </p>
<p>Christians to the governments concerned. All these attempts became chan-</p>
<p>nels to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ so that the world may know who </p>
<p>Jesus is. Persecution helped in some places the churches to grow rather than </p>
<p>to subside. We may easily understand why Jesus prayed for oneness to prevail </p>
<p>among his followers in the pattern of the oneness that prevails between the </p>
<p>Father and the Son by the Spirit.</p>
