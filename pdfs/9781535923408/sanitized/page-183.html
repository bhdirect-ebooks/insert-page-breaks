<p>John 15:1–17</p>
<p>155</p>
<p>Jesus’ disciples can be his friends only if they observe his command </p>
to love one another as he has loved them (15:12, 17). As Jesus’ divine love
<p>drew them together with him, relevantly he calls them “my friends.” While </p>
<p>in 15:15 Jesus gives the reason for calling them “friends,” in 15:16 he re-</p>
<p>minds them of how he took the initiative to make them his friends and the </p>
<p>purpose of his friendship. 15:15a can be rendered, “No longer do I speak to </p>
<p>you as slaves,” because a slave does not know what his master is doing and </p>
<p>why. He has to fully obey the master. Jesus has not treated his disciples as </p>
<p>slaves, but as friends, for he himself has demonstrated to them how to serve </p>
<p>one another with love (13:1, 14–15).</p>
<p>Out of his love as philos (“friend”), Jesus took the initiative to choose </p>
<p>his disciples; they did not choose him rst (15:16a). God, out of his love </p>
<p>and faithfulness to his covenant (Deut 7:7–8), chose people always to ac-</p>
<p>complish his task through which he will be gloried (e.g., Deut 7:6; 14:2; </p>
<p>18:5; Isa 41:8–9; 43:10; 44:1; 45:4; 49:3). Similarly, Jesus chose his disciples </p>
<p>to be commissioned to go and bear fruit that will remain (15:16b). In their </p>
<p>bearing fruit, the Father’s glory is manifested (15:8). It also prompts the </p>
<p>Father to give whatever the disciples will ask in the authority of Jesus’ name </p>
<p>(15:16c), just like the disciples’ abiding in Jesus and his words in them cause </p>
<p>the Father to answer their prayers (15:7). e insertion of the verb “to go </p>
<p>[and bring fruit]” in 15:16 is deliberate, and it denotes the movement of </p>
<p>the disciples to go into the world to fulll Jesus’ mission (17:18; 20:21). If </p>
<p>so, the idea of bringing fruit could imply bringing many to Christ.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>purpose of Jesus in choosing his followers, then, is to continue his mission </p>
<p>in the world. “Your fruit should remain” indicates this continuous process </p>
<p>of bearing and bringing fruit. Jesus eventually highlights his command to </p>
<p>his community to live in love with one another (15:17). Why is love empha-</p>
<p>sized? 15:18–25 will shed light on this.</p>
<p>The world’s hatred and Jesus’ remedy (15:18–27) </p>
<p>Loving one another is imperative within God’s new community, and only </p>
<p>then can they withstand the world’s hatred (1 John 3:11–15). Jesus chose his </p>
<p>disciples and separated them out of the world (15:19b). Although the term </p>
<p>“world” in John denotes evil forces that make human beings to hate Jesus, </p>
<p>in a few cases it means the whole creation of God (e.g., 21:25), particularly </p>
<p>the sphere of human aairs (e.g., 1:10; 3:16–17). As it hated Jesus, it will </p>
