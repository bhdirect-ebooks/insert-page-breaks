<p>and therefore they speak and work seeking for earthly things. In contrast, </p>
<p>Jesus, who comes from heaven, bears witness to heavenly things, which he </p>
<p>has seen and heard from the Father (3:32a; cf. 6:46; 8:26b; 12:49).</p>
<p>e same idea is expressed in 3:34: “For he whom God has sent speaks </p>
<p>the words of God.” Jesus is the agent who was sent into the world by God. </p>
<p>It is essentially the same as “he who comes from above.” He could speak the </p>
<p>words of God because God gives the Spirit to him without measure (3:34; </p>
<p>cf. 1:32–33). us God the Father works together with the Son and the Holy </p>
<p>Spirit to reveal himself to the world as true.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> God, out of his love (17:23b-</p>
<p>24), has given all things into Jesus’ hand (3:35). “All things,” entrusted to </p>
<p>the Son, may imply God’s own life (5:26), authority to judge (5:22, 27), </p>
<p>authority over all humans to give eternal life (17:2), Jesus’ followers (6:37; </p>
<p>17:6), the words to speak (12:49; 17:8), God’s name (17:6, 11–12) and glory </p>
<p>(17:22; cf. 1:14).</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although the Son testies to what he has seen and heard with the </p>
<p>Father, no human receives Jesus’ testimony (3:32). is means that no one </p>
<p>among Jesus’ opponents received his testimony to the one true God. But </p>
<p>whoever believes sets the seal on the fact that God is true (3:33). e Greek </p>
<p>word sphragizein, translated “to set the seal,” when it is followed by “that” </p>
<p>(hoti), means “to attest, certify, acknowledge,”</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>referring to an approval of</p>
<p>a legal document by putting a seal on it (cf. Esth 8:8, 10). e one who </p>
<p>accepts Jesus’ testimony experiences God’s love and life-giving power and </p>
<p>consequently attests that God is indeed trustworthy.</p>
<p>e summary ends with a reference to heavenly life, which is available </p>
<p>to those who believe in the Son, and to God’s wrath, which remains on any-</p>
<p>one who does not obey the Son (3:36). “Believing in the Son” and “obeying </p>
<p>the Son” are parallel terms (see comments on 3:15–16). Similarly, “eternal </p>
<p>life” or “life” is set against the eschatological wrath of God, which rests now </p>
<p>upon those who do not accept and obey the Son. Both eternal life and the </p>
<p>end-time wrath of God are spoken in the present tense (“has eternal life” </p>
<p>and “rests upon”), implying that they are already in operation among hu-</p>
<p>man beings. At the same time, the future-tense “shall not see life” indicates </p>
<p>that the one who does not obey now will not experience the future life with </p>
<p>God (cf. 5:24; 8:51, 52). Such dualism urges human beings to choose life </p>
<p>now by believing in the Son. </p>
