<p>John 21:24–25</p>
<p>213</p>
<p>Greek manuscript, and that it was added later by the same scribe to end the </p>
<p>Gospel.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>However, the textual evidence for treating 21:25 as a scribal gloss</p>
<p>is very slim.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>e phrase “I presume” indicates a certain person, probably the editor </p>
<p>who added comments, glosses, and the epilogue. He is certainly one among </p>
<p>those who endorse the beloved disciple’s witness as true. e author begins </p>
<p>John’s Gospel with the eternal existence of the Logos-Son, who is the Christ </p>
<p>(1:1–2), and the editor ends it with the eternal or neverending works of </p>
<p>Jesus Christ, the Logos incarnate (21:25). e author refers to the whole </p>
<p>creation as made through the Logos in whom there was life (1:3–5). e </p>
<p>editor ends with the same note, referring to the whole universe that could </p>
<p>not contain the books written on Jesus, the giver of life. us, 21:25 does </p>
<p>not consider the acts of Jesus being over, but looks forward to many who </p>
<p>will bear witness to Jesus verbally and in writing so that the church, God’s </p>
<p>new community, may grow. To this extent, the Gospel of John is an open-</p>
<p>ended Gospel, for it ends not with a period but only with a comma.</p>
