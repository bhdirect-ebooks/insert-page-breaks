<p>Excursus: e Understanding of the Logos in the First Century CE</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Logos (QE 68; cf. Mos. 2.95–100). As the Logos belongs to the intelligible </p>
<p>world (Opif. 4, 16; Mos. 2.127), it never descends to the sensible world, but </p>
<p>one should move to the intelligible world to encounter the Logos.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>For Philo,</p>
<p>mystical union with God in terms of indwelling within the soul’s life is possible </p>
<p>through the Logos (Post. 122, by interpreting Num 14:9).</p>
<p>Although people would have understood the Logos in different ways, </p>
<p>the underlying common theme is that the Logos is God and in the Logos one </p>
<p>can apprehend God. However, John’s insight that the Logos became ﬂesh is </p>
<p>missing. No wonder ﬁrst-century Christians meant by the Logos the “Christian </p>
<p>message” (e.g., Mark 2:2; 4:14; Acts 14:25), the content of which is Christ </p>
<p>and his glory (2 Cor 4:5–6) or “Christ cruciﬁed” (1 Cor 1:23; 2:2; Gal 3:1), </p>
<p>in whom one can see God.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons </p>
<p>Several years ago, one of my friends confronted me saying that Christianity </p>
<p>came into being by the birth of Jesus about two thousand years ago, whereas </p>
<p>other major religions had been in existence even before that time. This is an </p>
<p>example of how the world thinks of Christ and the time of his existence. The </p>
<p>proclamation of Jesus’ story as beginning from his pre-existence with the eter-</p>
<p>nal God as God would make it clear that Christ lived even before the time of </p>
<p>creation and that God’s plan to create a new community in Jesus Christ was in </p>
<p>him before anything was created. This message will lead hearers, particularly </p>
<p>those from other religious faith, to perceive Jesus as the unique revelation of </p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>There is a deep aspiration among many religious groups today to see the </p>
<p>one true God. People try to see God by spending a huge amount of money or </p>
<p>even by subduing and wounding one’s body. The Fourth Gospel proclaims that </p>
<p>the one true God revealed his character in Jesus, who is the place in which </p>
<p>one can see God now. God’s new community is called to bear witness to this </p>
<p>by words and deeds.</p>
