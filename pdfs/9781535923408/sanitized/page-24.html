<p>Introduction</p>
<p>xxiv</p>
<p>selectivity of narratives, discourses, and dialogues, narrative asides, and the </p>
<p>rsthand testimony of the eyewitnesses—all being distinctive features of </p>
<p>Greco-Roman historiography.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Dunn detects in John the Jesus tradition</p>
<p>(or the “earlier oral tradition”) remembered and retold in a dierent way </p>
<p>from the Jesus tradition used by the Synoptic writers.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>ese studies point</p>
<p>to a date in reasonable proximity to the eyewitnesses and the Jesus tradition </p>
<p>from which the composition of John derives.</p>
<p>e references to Christians being excommunicated from the syna-</p>
<p>gogue (9:22; 12:42; 16:2) bring us close to 85 CE, when the chart of “Eigh-</p>
<p>teen Benedictions” was prepared to curse Christians as heretics in the </p>
<p>synagogue services. It is justiable, then, to suggest that John was written </p>
<p>ca. 85–90 CE</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> and published ca. 100 CE.</p>
<p>What Is the Historical Setting in Which John’s Gospel </p>
<p>Emerged?</p>
<p>(i) If our contention for John as the late-rst-century document is cor-</p>
<p>rect, then the persecution and threat of death faced by Christians </p>
<p>from “the Jews” at that time is the milieu in which John might have </p>
<p>been written (9:22; 12:42; 16:2). e Jewish authorities could not ac-</p>
<p>cept Jesus as the Christ because Jesus, for them, made himself equal to </p>
<p>God (5:18; 10:33, 36) but was eventually crucied as a criminal. is </p>
<p>religio-historical situation explains why John emphasizes the present </p>
<p>availability of the life of the age to come for those who believe in the </p>
<p>crucied Jesus as the Christ.</p>
<p>(ii) Aer the fall of Jerusalem with its temple in 70 CE, the rabbis at-</p>
<p>tempted intensively to revive Judaism. Rabbis like Yohanan ben Zak-</p>
<p>kai (1–84 CE) and other religious Jews meditated on the Law with the </p>
<p>aim of bringing the presence of God down to earth in the absence of </p>
<p>the temple. Belief in angels as mediators between the transcendent </p>
<p>God and human beings became common. At this point, interest on </p>
<p>“Merkabah mysticism,” an experience of ascending to heaven in a </p>
<p>trance by means of meditation on the Scripture (e.g., Ezekiel 1, Isaiah </p>
<p>to have come from the inner circle of the Twelve; cf. Robinson 1976: 307–8 n. 218.</p>
<p>24. Bauckham 2007: 17–36.</p>
<p>25. Dunn 2011: 157–85.</p>
<p>26. Keener 2005: 1.140–42 suggests a date around 90 CE as a working hypothesis.</p>
