<p>Feeding of the Multitude</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>ate as ve thousand (cf. Matt 14:21 par.) to show the intensity of Jesus’ sign. </p>
<p>Before distributing, Jesus took the loaves and gave thanks, obviously to </p>
<p>God, and similarly the sh (John 6:11; Matt 14:19 par.). John focuses on Je-</p>
<p>sus as the host at the meal who distributed the loaves and sh to the people, </p>
<p>unlike the Synoptic Gospels, in which Jesus delegates the responsibility of </p>
<p>distribution to the disciples (Matt 14:19 par.).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since Jesus took the bread and gave thanks before distribution in the </p>
<p>Last Supper also (Matt 26:27 par.; 1 Cor 11:24–25), some nd eucharistic </p>
<p>echoes in John’s account of feeding.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>However, the Jews always used to give</p>
<p>thanks to God before eating and the host would distribute the bread. “Giv-</p>
<p>ing thanks” for the gi of food is a symbolic act of giving it into the hands </p>
<p>of God before distribution. e Eucharist would be observed privately with </p>
<p>his twelve disciples and not in public. e event in John only shows that </p>
<p>Jesus fed the hungry, and that the abundance of Jesus’ supply is beyond </p>
<p>human comprehension (6:7, 9).</p>
<p>e people ate as much as they wanted and were satised (6:12). Jesus’ </p>
<p>instruction, aer this, to the disciples to gather the fragments le over (cf. </p>
<p>Ruth 2:14) so that nothing may be lost shows that he wishes his follow-</p>
<p>ers, as per the Jewish custom,</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>to use the food le over responsibly. e</p>
<p>gathered fragments of ve barley loaves lled twelve baskets (6:13). e </p>
<p>precise numbers shows how Jesus can multiply a little thing given in his </p>
<p>hands and meet the needs of many. e twelve baskets could be an allusion </p>
<p>to the twelve tribes of Israel, which constitute the people of God, leading </p>
<p>on to Jesus’ twelve disciples, who constitute the core of the new people of </p>
<p>God (6:67, 70, 71).</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>By seeing the sign, people understood Jesus as “truly the prophet who </p>
<p>is coming into the world” (6:14; cf. 4:19; 7:40, 52). “e prophet” promised </p>
<p>by Moses may refer to the Messiah (Deut 18:15–19; cf. 4QTest 5–8; 1QS </p>
<p>9.11). However, in John, the title “prophet” alone does not identify Jesus </p>
<p>as the Messiah. Wherever the term “prophet” occurs, it is superseded by </p>
<p>such titles as “Christ,” “Son of Man” and “Son of God” (4:25–26; 6:32–58; </p>
<p>7:40–43; 9:35–38).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>But the phrase, “[the prophet] who is coming into the</p>
<p>world” has a messianic connotation (John 11:27; 12:13; cf. Matt 11:3). </p>
