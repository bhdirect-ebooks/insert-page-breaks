<p>John 16:16–33</p>
<p>163</p>
<p>in 16:23 may be read either with asking the Father or with the Father’s giv-</p>
<p>ing. In the light of 16:24 it is sensible to read the phrase with asking the </p>
<p>Father who gives what is asked in Jesus’ name and not on the merit of the </p>
<p>petitioners. Both asking in Jesus’ name and God’s giving in Jesus’ name </p>
<p>complement each other.</p>
<p>Jesus acknowledges that he has spoken “these things” in gures </p>
<p>(16:25a). “ese things” may refer not only to Jesus’ speech in 16:16–24, but </p>
<p>to the whole Pastoral Speech.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>He refers to the forthcoming “hour” when he</p>
<p>will no longer speak with his disciples in cryptic words, but will tell them </p>
<p>plainly of the Father (16:25b). e term “hour,” without the denite article </p>
<p>in Greek, indicates the period aer the resurrection when the church will </p>
<p>receive the Holy Spirit</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>and Jesus will speak plainly of the Father through</p>
<p>the Spirit. </p>
<p>Jesus says further that aer his death and resurrection (“in that day”), </p>
<p>his disciples will ask the Father by claiming the authority of Jesus’ name, </p>
<p>and they will have direct access to the Father. ere will be no need, then, </p>
<p>for Jesus to pray for them to receive something (16:26). Jesus assures of the </p>
<p>Father’s continuous love for his community, because they have loved Jesus </p>
<p>and have believed that he came from the Father (16:27; 17:8). God himself </p>
<p>grants their prayers out of his love for them. Love and faith are thus the </p>
<p>binding factors of the believers with God and Jesus. Jesus reiterates that he </p>
<p>has come into the world from the Father (cf. 1:9; 3:19; 6:38; 8:23) and that </p>
<p>he is leaving the world to return to the Father aer his mission is completed </p>
<p>(16:28; cf. 13:1). is reects the Jewish principle that an agent should re-</p>
<p>turn to his sender to give an account of the mission for which he was sent.</p>
<p>Jesus’ promise that in the coming “hour” he will speak with them </p>
<p>plainly of the Father (16:25), his assurance that the Father himself loves </p>
<p>them (16:27), and his mission statement (16:28) made the disciples exclaim, </p>
<p>“Behold, now you are speaking plainly and not in any gure!” (16:29). ey </p>
<p>believed that Jesus’ promise to speak plainly of the Father in the hour that </p>
<p>is coming was already being fullled.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>At the end of Jesus’ Pastoral Speech,</p>
<p>the disciples began to perceive that Jesus knows all things about God and </p>
<p>that there is no need for anyone to question him unlike they questioned </p>
<p>him previously (13:36–37; 14:5, 8). erefore they arm their faith, saying, </p>
<p>9. Cf. Köstenberger 2009: 477.</p>
<p>10. “An hour” indicates the eects of Jesus’ hour of glorication on the cross to those </p>
<p>who believe in him; Brown 1978: 2.518.</p>
