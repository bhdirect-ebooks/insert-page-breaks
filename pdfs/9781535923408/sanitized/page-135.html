<p>John 10:1–21</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>recognize the shepherd’s voice, as he calls them by name in order to as-</p>
<p>semble them and lead them out for food and drink (John 10:3; cf. Num </p>
<p>27:17; Ps 23:2; 80:1).</p>
<p>e sheep of Jesus are “his own” possession (10:4, 14) for whom he </p>
<p>has unfailing love. When all his sheep come out of the fold, the shepherd </p>
<p>goes before them and the sheep follow him by recognizing rightly their </p>
<p>shepherd’s voice. ey will not go aer false shepherds, because they are </p>
<p>not familiar with the voice of such strangers (10:5). Surprisingly, they (i.e., </p>
<p>the Pharisees) did not understand about what he was speaking to them. </p>
<p>Based on Ezekiel 34, they should have understood the imagery as picturing </p>
<p>the intimate relationship that exists between God and his people. is again </p>
<p>proves how blind they were to Jesus’ teachings, though they claimed, “We </p>
<p>see” (9:41).</p>
<p>It is 10:7–18 that explains who the door of the sheep is and who the </p>
<p>shepherd is. It does not seem to hinder a smooth reading of the passage,</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>but gives proper continuity to 10:1–6. e word “door” stands for Jesus, </p>
<p>the protector of the sheep from “thieves and robbers” (10:1, 8), and this </p>
<p>unchangeable truth is brought out with a solemn armation, “truly, truly, </p>
<p>I say to you” (10:7). In this context, the “thieves and robbers” denote the </p>
<p>Jewish rulers who came “before” Jesus to steal the faith of his sheep, as it is </p>
<p>illustrated in their vain attempt to drag the healed man away from his faith </p>
<p>in Jesus. us, the phrase “before me” has a spatial connotation rather than </p>
<p>a temporal connotation.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Jesus interprets the parable further by revealing himself as “I am the </p>
<p>door (of the sheep)” (10:7, 9) and thus reveals God, who is “I am that I am,” </p>
<p>as the door to protect his people and lead them out in paths of righteous-</p>
<p>ness, goodness, and prosperity (Ps 23). In the OT, the word “gate [of heav-</p>
<p>en]” indicates God’s self-revelation and his bestowal of gis to his chosen </p>
<p>ones (Gen 28:17; Ps 78:23; Ps 118:19, 20). In the NT, the “door” or “gate” </p>
<p>indicates the point of entrance into heavenly life or eternal destruction at </p>
<p>the end-time and the revelation of heavenly secrets to his devotee (Matt </p>
<p>7:13, 14; 25:10; Mark 9:43, 45, 47; Luke 13:24, 25; Rev 4:1). e armation </p>
<p>that Jesus is the door implies God’s self-manifestation and the means of </p>
<p>imparting God’s gis and heavenly secrets to human beings, particularly to </p>
<p>those who belong to his sheepfold. In this sense, those who have Jesus as </p>
<p>the only way to enter will be delivered from eternal damnation.</p>
