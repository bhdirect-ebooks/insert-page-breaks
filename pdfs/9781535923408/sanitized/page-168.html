<p>Two Predictions Sandwiched by Jesus’ New Commandment</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>have enabled Jesus easily to give the dipped morsel to him (13:26)</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>and talk</p>
<p>to him without being overheard by other disciples (13:27–29). Simon Peter, </p>
<p>who might have been sitting at a speaking distance to the beloved disciple, </p>
<p>signaled him to enquire who it is of whom Jesus speaks as betrayer (13:24). </p>
<p>is leads the beloved disciple to lie close to the chest of Jesus to ask him, </p>
<p>“Lord, who is it?” (13:25). </p>
<p>Jesus identies the person to the beloved disciple by saying, “It is that </p>
<p>man to whom I shall dip the morsel and give it.” When he had dipped the </p>
<p>morsel, he gave to Judas, the son of Iscariot (13:26). “Morsel” could be a </p>
<p>piece of bread rather than a bunch of the bitter herbs that were dipped into </p>
<p>fruit purée at the Passover meal. Dipping bread into a sauce dish and giv-</p>
<p>ing it to a guest was a favor done by the host.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Jesus’ special favor done to</p>
<p>Judas exemplies that he loved his own until the end (13:1). Judas accepted </p>
<p>the bread, but he did not change his decision to betray Jesus. It shows how </p>
<p>deliberately Judas became a traitor (Luke 6:16) and treacherous. Soon aer </p>
<p>he received the bread, Satan, the power of evil, entered into him to hasten </p>
<p>to do what had already been put in his mind (13:2). By sending Judas out </p>
<p>with a command to betray him quickly (13:27), Jesus proves that he is in </p>
<p>full control of his hour and that even Satan operates with his permission.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>e other disciples could hear Jesus commanding Judas, “What you </p>
<p>are going to do, do quickly,” but they did not know why he spoke thus to </p>
<p>him (13:28). Some thought that because Judas was holding the money box </p>
<p>(cf. 12:6) Jesus had asked him to buy the needed things for the feast or to </p>
<p>give some help to the poor (13:29). It was customary to give alms to the </p>
<p>poor on the Passover night.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Judas was actually going to sell his master for</p>
<p>his own monetary prot (cf. Matt 26:14–16; Mark 14:10–11) rather than </p>
<p>spending money to buy anything for others. e unintended result of his </p>
<p>action will be to procure for the feast the true Lamb of God, who will be </p>
<p>killed for removing the sins of humanity.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Aer he received the morsel, Judas le the place immediately (13:30). </p>
<p>We can see a picture of Satan taking full control of Judas, but obeying Jesus’ </p>
<p>command to do it “quickly.” e narrator adds the comment, “And it was </p>
