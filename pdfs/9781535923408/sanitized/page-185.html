<p>John 15:18–27</p>
<p>157</p>
<p>Even the world’s hatred of both Jesus and the Father is due to the </p>
divine necessity for fullling what is written in “their Law,” which refers
<p>to the whole OT (15:25a). By “their Law,” Jesus means the Law observed </p>
<p>by “the Jews,” who do not perceive that their own Law witnesses to Jesus </p>
<p>(5:39; see comments on 8:17; 10:34). Jesus quotes, “ey hated me without </p>
<p>a cause” (15:25b), which might have been taken either from Ps 35:19 or </p>
<p>from Ps 69:4 (cf. Ps 109:3; 119:161), although none of these passages have </p>
<p>the same wordings. It seems it is a common statement used by the Jews in </p>
<p>their prayers referring to the unjust persecution they faced in the hands of </p>
<p>their enemies, particularly the Gentiles (Pss. Sol. 7:1).</p>
<p>Jesus’ followers, however, are not without help in a hostile situation. </p>
<p>Jesus assures them of the coming of the paraklētos, the presence of the Spirit </p>
<p>of truth, to help. In 14:16 and 26 the origin of the Spirit of truth is the </p>
<p>Father, whereas in 15:26 Jesus asserts, “I shall send (the paraklētos) from </p>
<p>the Father” and “the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father.” Sending </p>
<p>the paraklētos is the corporate function of the Father and the Son. What the </p>
<p>Father does, the Son also does (5:17, 19). e Son sends the Spirit of truth </p>
<p>from the Father and the Spirit proceeds from the Father (15:26). ere is </p>
<p>not only oneness and function shared between the Father, the Son, and the </p>
<p>Holy Spirit, but also submission to one another. e Father listens to the </p>
<p>prayer of Jesus (14:16) and sends the paraklētos in Jesus’ name (14:26a), </p>
<p>whereas the Son sends the paraklētos from the Father (15:26a). e Spirit </p>
<p>of truth will bear witness to the Son in the world that hates him and his </p>
<p>people (15:26b).</p>
<p>e Spirit will bear witness to Jesus in and through God’s new com-</p>
<p>munity (“You also are my witnesses”; 15:27a). Bearing witness to someone </p>
<p>is always in favor of that person in a forensic context. Jesus’ community </p>
<p>bears witness to him,</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>as they had been with Jesus “from the beginning”</p>
<p>(15:27b), that is, “from the start of Jesus’ ministry to its close”</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>(cf. Acts</p>
<p>1:22). e community of Jesus’ disciples witnesses to Jesus not in its own </p>
<p>strength, but by the power of the Spirit (15:26–27).</p>
<p>10. e Greek word martureite (“You are witnessing”) should be taken as an indica-</p>
<p>tive verb rather than an imperative, because the disciples were already bearing witness </p>
<p>to Jesus (e.g., 1:41–48) and they did not need to be commanded to testify about Jesus.</p>
