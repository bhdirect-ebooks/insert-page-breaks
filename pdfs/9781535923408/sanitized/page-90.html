<p>JOHN 6</p>
<p>Two Signs and a Discourse</p>
<p>Feeding of the multitude (John 6:1–15) </p>
<p>e “feeding of the multitude” appears in all four Gospels. According to </p>
<p>Matthew and Mark, aer the feeding, the disciples crossed to the other </p>
<p>side, to the land at Gennesaret (Matt 14:34; Mark 6:53) that lies on the </p>
<p>western shore south of Capernaum, although Jesus instructed them to go </p>
<p>to Bethsaida (Mark 6:45) on the northeastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. In </p>
<p>Luke the feeding took place at Bethsaida (Luke 9:10–17). John too indicates </p>
<p>the same location, for aer the feeding the disciples cross the sea to go to </p>
<p>Capernaum on the northwest coast (John 6:17, 24). e Gospel accounts, </p>
<p>when put together, show that the feeding miracle happened in the hilly </p>
<p>country northeast of Bethsaida and that the disciples rowed back to Caper-</p>
<p>naum, which was near the land of Gennesaret, with Bethsaida en route.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>e phrase “aer this” (6:1) links two events allowing room for inter-</p>
<p>vening occurrences.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>erefore there is no need to read John 6 aer John</p>
<p>4, as some scholars propose.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Even if we rearrange the chapters, there is no</p>
<p>smooth transition between Jesus’ healing in Cana and the scene at the Sea </p>
<p>of Galilee. Jesus went across the Sea of Galilee, that is, of Tiberias (Luke </p>
<p>5:1; J.W. 3.10.7 identies it as the “sea of Gennesaret”). e name of the </p>
<p>city, Tiberias, which was founded by Herod Antipas (ca. 20 CE) on the </p>
<p>southwest side of the Sea of Galilee and named aer the emperor Tiberius </p>
<p>(14–37 CE), came to be used for the Sea of Galilee. Jesus crossed the sea to </p>
<p>go to a mountain situated perhaps near Bethsaida, the hometown of Philip </p>
<p>and Andrew (1:44), both of whom had active roles in the feeding miracle </p>
<p>(6:5, 8–9). Jesus sat down upon the mountain along with his disciples </p>
