<p>John 10:22–31</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>to enter his sheepfold (cf. 1:41, 45; 4:25–26; 9:35–37; 12:34; 20:31), but “the </p>
<p>Jews” are not his sheep because of their unbelief (10:26).</p>
<p>e sheep owned by Jesus obey his voice and follow him wherever he </p>
<p>leads (10:3–4, 27). Jesus knows them, as he has an intimate relationship of </p>
<p>love with them (10:27, 14). Since he knows them, he gives them the life of </p>
<p>the age to come, even now, and they will be delivered from nal destruc-</p>
<p>tion and from the thieves who would try to snatch his sheep from his hand </p>
<p>(10:28, 10, 12–15). Jesus assures that no one, even a Jewish authority, is able </p>
<p>to snatch his sheep out of his Father’s hand, because the Father, who has </p>
<p>given them to Jesus, is greater than all powers (10:29).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>“Out of my hand” and “out of the Father’s hand” are the same, for the </p>
<p>sheep are under the protection and care of the Father and the Son, who are </p>
<p>one in works (5:17), words (3:34; 8:26), glory (1:14; 13:31–32), name (17:6, </p>
<p>11), life (5:21, 26), and authority to judge (5:22, 27). erefore the one who </p>
<p>sees the Son sees the Father (12:45; 14:9), and the one who believes in Jesus </p>
<p>believes in God (12:44). Both the Father and the Son mutually indwell one </p>
<p>another (14:10–11). erefore the Johannine Jesus plainly arms, “I and </p>
<p>the Father are one” (10:30). Father and Son pre-existed in oneness with </p>
<p>each other, although they are two personalities and therefore the Son alone </p>
<p>can reveal God who otherwise cannot be seen with human eyes (1:1, 18; </p>
<p>6:46). Jesus’ reclaim for equality with the Father so kindled the anger of his </p>
<p>opponents that they took up stones to stone and kill him (10:31; cf. 8:59). </p>
<p>Is Jesus the Son of God? (10:32–39) </p>
<p>Without leaving the temple this time, Jesus confronts his enemies. He asks </p>
<p>them ironically for which of the good works he did are they going to stone </p>
<p>him (10:32). Jesus’ works, including the two signs done on the Sabbath (5:9, </p>
<p>16; 9:14), are good because they involve the giving, not taking, of life.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>“the Jews” responded by saying that Jesus, being a man, made himself God </p>
<p>and thus spoke blasphemy that deserved death by stoning (John 10:33; cf. </p>
Lev 24:16). ey could not perceive the divine truth behind Jesus’ declara-
<p>tion, “I and the Father are one” (10:30).</p>
<p>In response, Jesus appeals to the Scripture by saying, “Is it not writ-</p>
<p>ten in your law, ‘I said, you are gods?,’” a question that expects the answer </p>
<p>“yes” (10:34). “Your law” means the Law that the Jews themselves uphold </p>
