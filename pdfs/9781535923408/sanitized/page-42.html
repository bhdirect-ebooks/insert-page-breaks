<p>Jesus during his baptism (1:32; cf. Matt 3:16 par.). John uses the Synoptic </p>
<p>tradition freely with an emphasis on the “remaining” of the Spirit on Jesus </p>
<p>(1:32–33).</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> Jesus was revealed to the Baptist by God, who sent John to bap-</p>
<p>tize with water, as the one who baptizes people with the Holy Spirit by means </p>
<p>of a vision of the descent of the Spirit that remained upon Jesus (1:33). is </p>
<p>echoes Isa 11:1–2 LXX, where the identifying mark of the Christ is the rest-</p>
<p>ing of the Spirit of the Lord upon him. at Jesus is “the one who baptizes </p>
<p>with the Holy Spirit” implies that Jesus, the bearer of God’s Spirit, is the one </p>
<p>who lls those who believe in him with the same Spirit. e baptism with </p>
<p>water can purify and prepare people to accept Christ, the Son of God, but </p>
the baptism with the Holy Spirit will enable believers to experience divine
<p>life and to continue his mission in the world (4:14; 7:37–39; 20:21–23).</p>
<p>Soon aer the Baptist saw the descent of the Holy Spirit on Jesus, im-</p>
<p>plicitly at the time of Jesus’ baptism, he bore witness that Jesus is the Son </p>
<p>of God (1:34). In John the title “Son of God” is spoken of equally with God </p>
<p>the Father (5:18; 10:30; 14:9–11), in contrast to the Roman emperor, who </p>
<p>also was called “son of God.” In this sense, Jesus’ sonship is the only of its </p>
<p>kind. e Jews in Qumran identied the “son” in 2 Sam 7:14 and Ps 2:7 </p>
<p>with the Messiah begotten by God (1QSa 2.11–12; 4QFlor 1.1–19), and </p>
<p>similarly John identies the “Son of God” with the Messiah. At rst the </p>
<p>Baptist cryptically introduces Jesus as “the one standing among you whom </p>
<p>you do not know” (1:26), and the veil is removed for the “insiders” when he </p>
<p>introduces Jesus as the Lamb of God (1:29), and nally he reveals the one </p>
<p>“upon whom the Spirit descends and remains” (1:33) as the Son of God.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>Emergence of Jesus’ new community (1:35–51) </p>
<p>e next day aer the Baptist unveiled who Jesus is, two of his disciples </p>
<p>followed Jesus and came into fellowship with him. is initiates the dawn </p>
<p>of the new covenant community around Jesus. e Baptist introduced Je-</p>
<p>sus, who was walking by, to these disciples saying, “Behold, the Lamb of </p>
<p>God” (1:36). e name of one of the two is mentioned as Andrew, Simon </p>
<p>Peter’s brother, but the name of the other is hidden (1:40). eir immedi-</p>
<p>ate response of following Jesus proves the convincing eect of the Baptist’s </p>
<p>31. e word “to remain” (menein), which is used about forty times in the Gospel, </p>
<p>indicates the intimate union that exists between Jesus and the Father and also between </p>
<p>Jesus and his followers.</p>
