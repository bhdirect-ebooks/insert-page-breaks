<p>JOHN 4</p>
<p>The Inclusive Nature of Jesus’ Community</p>
<p>Proper setting for the dialogue (4:1–6) </p>
<p>e Lord came to know that the Pharisees had heard that he was making </p>
<p>and baptizing more disciples than John (4:1).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> However, the narrator clari-</p>
<p>es that Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples did (4:2). As there </p>
<p>was a possibility for the Pharisees to kill him (cf. 7:1), Jesus le Judea to go </p>
<p>again to Galilee (4:3). </p>
<p>It was necessary for Jesus to go through Samaria, the normal route </p>
<p>for anyone to go to Galilee from Judea (4:4). Samaria is a region that lies </p>
<p>in between Judea in the south and Galilee in the north.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Strict Jews hated</p>
<p>Samaritans (cf. 4:9) and avoided going through Samaria to enter Galilee. </p>
e Greek word edei (“it was necessary”) refers to the divine necessity for
<p>Jesus to pass through Samaria so that he could meet a Samaritan woman </p>
<p>and bring salvation through her to many Samaritans. us, Jesus crossed </p>
<p>the racial, religious, and geographical barriers to enter into Samaria and the </p>
<p>gender barrier to have a dialogue with a woman. He went to Sychar, a city </p>
<p>in Samaria, and sat beside a well, built up in the eld that Jacob gave to his </p>
<p>son Joseph (John 4:5–6; cf. Gen 33:19; 48:22; Josh 24:32).</p>
<p>Aer Pompey, the Roman general who captured Palestine (63 BCE), </p>
<p>Sychar replaced Shechem as the most important Samaritan city.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Jacob had</p>
<p>erected an altar, called El-Elohe-Israel (“God, the God of Israel”), in the </p>
<p>land of Shechem (Gen 33:18–20) and he would have dug also a well (liter-</p>
<p>ally “a spring of water”). Out of tiredness and thirst, Jesus sat down to rest </p>
1. Jesus is mentioned as “the Lord,” a divine title, which John uses rarely for earthly
<p>Jesus and therefore later manuscripts changed this title to “Jesus.”</p>
<p>2. e name Samaria is derived from Shemer, a city built by Omri, the king of Israel, </p>
<p>aer buying the hill from Shemer in about 870 BCE (1 Kgs 16:24). Eventually the city’s </p>
<p>name, Samaria, became the name of the region.</p>
