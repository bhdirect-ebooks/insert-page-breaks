<p>e Jewish Trial and Peter’s Denial</p>
<p>176</p>
<p>Aer bringing Peter into the courtyard, the unnamed disciple disap-</p>
<p>pears. e door-keeping maid recognizes Peter as the disciple of the “ac-</p>
<p>cused” Jesus who was on trial and hence poses the doubtful question, “Are </p>
<p>you also not one of this man’s disciples?” Peter categorically denies the rst </p>
<p>time, “I am not,” perhaps in order to save himself (18:17). He leaves the </p>
<p>place immediately and soon joins the high priest’s servants and the temple </p>
<p>police who had gone to arrest Jesus and who were then standing and warm-</p>
<p>ing themselves within the courtyard around the charcoal re, because it </p>
<p>was cold (18:18; cf. Mark 14:54). John alone gives the weather as being cold. </p>
<p>Peter is ignorant that those who came to arrest could better identify him as </p>
<p>a close associate of Jesus than the maid. We need to wait until 18:25 for the </p>
<p>continuation of this story.</p>
<p>John shis the scene from Peter’s denial of Jesus to Jesus’ trial before </p>
<p>Annas (cf. 18:13), who was questioning Jesus about his disciples and his </p>
<p>teaching (18:19). It is Johannine pattern to shi between scenes that take </p>
<p>place outside and inside alternately in the passion narrative. e Johannine </p>
<p>Jesus does not answer concerning his disciples, but only about his teaching. </p>
<p>He answers that he has spoken openly to all humans in the world, and that </p>
<p>he spoke nothing secretly. As witnesses Jesus points to all Jewish people </p>
<p>who came together in the synagogues and in the remple, where Jesus always </p>
<p>taught (18:20). Without disclosing the content of his teaching, Jesus boldly </p>
<p>questions Annas, “Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard what I </p>
<p>have spoken to them; behold, they know what I said” (18:21).</p>
<p>While Jesus’ teaching was given to all people publicly, Annas should </p>
<p>have asked those who heard him, because in ocial proceedings it was not </p>
<p>the accused who was interrogated, but the witnesses for and against the </p>
<p>accused.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Jesus thus unveils the ignorance of Annas of Jewish Law. Jesus’</p>
<p>question causes a temple guard, a bystander, to become so annoyed that he </p>
<p>slaps Jesus with his hand (cf. 19:3), the rst physical attack on Jesus in John’s </p>
<p>passion narrative! His angry statement, “Do you answer like this to a high </p>
<p>priest?” (18:22), shows that the bystanders took Jesus’ words as containing </p>
<p>disrespect to a top religious authority.</p>
<p>Jesus did not repay violence for violence, but confronted the ocial by </p>
<p>saying, “If I have spoken wrongly, bear witness to the wrong, but if I have </p>
<p>spoken rightly, why do you strike me?” (18:23). “If I have spoken wrongly” </p>
<p>reads literally, “if I spoke in an evil manner,” meaning, “if I said something </p>
<p>13. Kruse 2008: 349. Rabbinic law prohibited anyone from being sentenced to death </p>
<p>based on the accused person’s confession (m. Sanh. 6:2).</p>
