<p>JOHN 19</p>
<p>The Supreme Revelation of God’s Glory</p>
<p>The Roman trial, part 2 (19:1–16) </p>
<p>In 19:1–3, which constitutes the fourth scene, we are led inside the prae-</p>
<p>torium, as the Roman trial continues. Although Pilate found no crime in </p>
<p>Jesus, he gave him up to the soldiers to nd out who Jesus is by scourging </p>
<p>(19:1; cf. Acts 22:24). Jesus was given the most severe form of punishments: </p>
<p>scourging, beating, and ogging. </p>
<p>Jesus becomes a “mock king” in the hands of the soldiers. ey plaited </p>
<p>a crown of thorns, put it on his head, and clothed him with a purple robe, </p>
<p>and kept going up to him, saying, “Hail, O King of the Jews!,” and inicted </p>
<p>him with blows (19:2–3). e crown of thorns consisted of the long spikes </p>
<p>of the date palm with some branches twisted together. e thorns may have </p>
<p>come from the common thorn bush (Isa 34:13; Nah 1:10) or from date </p>
<p>palms with twelve-inch-long thorns near the base, and these thorns would </p>
<p>sink into the victim’s skull, causing considerable pain.</p>

<p>By greeting Jesus</p>
<p>as “the King of the Jews,” a title that was normally used to greet Caesar, </p>
<p>the soldiers unconsciously acknowledged him as King in his humiliation </p>
<p>and suering, anticipating his reign from the cross. Scourging, slapping, </p>
<p>and spitting (Matt 27:30 par.) recapitulate Isaiah’s experience (Isa 50:6). </p>
<p>Since the “mock king” scene depicts that Jesus is the King of the Jews in his </p>
<p>humiliation and suering, John puts this scene at the center of Jesus’ trial </p>
<p>before Pilate.</p>
<p>e h scene shows Pilate’s interaction with “the Jews” outside. Pilate </p>
<p>brings the humiliated Jesus out to them to make them know that he found </p>
<p>no crime in Jesus (19:4) When Jesus comes out wearing the crown of thorns </p>
<p>and the purple robe, Pilate says to them, “Behold the man!” (19:5). Pilate’s </p>
<p>acclamation recalls Samuel’s introduction of Saul as king, “Behold the man </p>
