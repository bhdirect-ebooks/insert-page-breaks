<p>John 11:45–57</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>Decision of the Jewish council to kill Jesus (11:45–57) </p>
<p>ere was a double response to Jesus’ sign of raising Lazarus. Many Judeans </p>
<p>who had come with Mary looked at the sign and started believing in Jesus </p>
<p>(11:45). However, some of them went and told the Pharisees, who were al-</p>
<p>ready looking for an opportunity to arrest Jesus and put him to death (5:18; </p>
<p>7:1, 30, 32; 8:20, 59; 10:31, 39; 11:8), what Jesus did to Lazarus (11:46). </p>
<p>Being aggravated with what they heard, the chief priests and the Pharisees, </p>
<p>who constituted the Sanhedrin (the Jewish council), gathered the council to </p>
<p>discuss on what they should do with Jesus who was performing many signs </p>
<p>(20:30; 21:25) and drawing many to believe in him. ey feared that if every </p>
<p>one starts believing in Jesus,</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>then the believers would make him king (cf.</p>
<p>6:14–15), which would mean rebellion against the Roman governance. It </p>
<p>would then provoke the Romans to come and take away their place, the </p>
<p>Jerusalem temple (cf. 2 Macc 1:29; 5:19; Acts 6:14; 21:28), and nation, the </p>
<p>people of Israel (11:48). us, they were troubled by the religious and po-</p>
<p>litical consequences of the mass following Jesus. is could be a political </p>
<p>prophecy concerning the Romans, who would seize Jerusalem in 66–70 CE </p>
<p>to destroy the temple and take away the Jews as slaves.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Caiaphas, the high priest of that year, is the spokesperson in this dis-</p>
<p>cussion. In 18–36 CE he was the high priest, the ex ocio president of the </p>
<p>Sanhedrin, and thus he was “one of them.” e phrase “of that year” does </p>
<p>not mean that the high priests were appointed annually, though in some </p>
<p>cases that happened. It means “in that year,” that is, “in the year when Jesus </p>
<p>was arrested and crucied.”</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Caiaphas chides the council members that</p>
<p>they know nothing (11:49), for they do not reckon that it is advantageous </p>
<p>for them if one man dies for the people instead of the whole nation perish-</p>
<p>ing (11:50). ough Caiaphas’ counsel is politically motivated, it is within </p>
<p>God’s redemptive plan for the welfare of all nations and therefore he is later </p>
<p>reminded of what he suggested (18:14). </p>
<p>ere was a belief that the high priests had a gi of prophecy</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>therefore the narrator comments that, being the high priest in that year, </p>
<p>Caiaphas himself unknowingly prophesied that Jesus was going to die not </p>
<p>only for the salvation of Jewish nation but also for the ingathering of the </p>
<p>12. e word “every one” is an exaggerated form for “many.”</p>
