<p>JOHN 8</p>
<p>Intensiﬁcation of Jesus’ Conﬂict with “the Jews”</p>
<p>7:53–8:11 is not found in the earliest and most reliable Greek manuscripts. </p>
<p>No Greek commentator before twelh century seems to make any reference </p>
<p>to this passage. Bultmann omits this passage in his commentary, stating </p>
<p>that it belongs neither to John’s Gospel nor to the ecclesiastical redaction.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many commentators think that it interrupts the events and discourse at </p>
<p>the feast of Tabernacles. Most of the vocabularies used in 8:1–11 are not </p>
<p>Johannine,</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>but Lucan (cf. Luke 7:36–50). is does not mean that the story</p>
<p>in 7:53—8:11 is not historical. Papias, for example, mentions of a woman </p>
<p>who was accused of many sins before the Lord, which the Gospel according </p>
<p>to the Hebrews contains (Hist. eccl. 3.39). e story of Jesus forgiving the </p>
<p>sins of adulterous women was already in circulation. Perhaps it was not </p>
<p>accepted into NT canon for a long time lest it encourage the sin of adultery </p>
<p>in the early church. John inserts the story at this point probably to illustrate </p>
<p>the transforming power of Jesus, the Light, to forgive and warn sinners, by </p>
<p>overturning the condemnation pronounced by the Law (8:5, 11).</p>
<p>Reversal of the Law’s condemnation (7:53–8:11) </p>
<p>e opening statement, “And they went each to his home” (7:53), followed </p>
<p>by Jesus going to the Mount of Olives (8:1), presupposes a concluded as-</p>
<p>sembly of people in which Jesus had taught. In the early morning Jesus </p>
<p>came to the temple again to teach and the whole people came to listen to </p>
<p>him (John 8:2; cf. Luke 19:47; 20:1; 21:37–38). Jesus sat down and taught, </p>
<p>as Jewish teachers used to do. At this point the scribes and the Pharisees </p>
<p>brought before him a woman, probably a married woman, whom they said </p>
<p>was caught in adultery (8:3–4).</p>
