<p>John 13:21–38</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>Two predictions sandwiched by Jesus’ new commandment </p>
<p>(13:21–38) </p>
<p>Judas’ betrayal predicted (13:21–30) </p>
<p>Next we see that Jesus is troubled in spirit (cf. 11:33; 12:27) because he </p>
<p>knows that he is going to be betrayed by a member of his own community. </p>
<p>He testies to the truth solemnly that one of them will betray him (13:21). </p>
<p>Obviously, the disciples did not understand Jesus’ use of the Scripture to say </p>
<p>that his own friend lied his heel against him. erefore they looked at one </p>
<p>another, being uncertain of the identity of that person (13:22). </p>
<p>For the rst time, one of his disciples is introduced as the one whom </p>
<p>Jesus loved, and he was lying close to the chest of Jesus during the sup-</p>
<p>per (13:23). e identity of this disciple, who is not named at all, has been </p>
<p>the subject of diering views. He is the disciple who was at the cross and </p>
<p>who bore witness to what he had seen (19:35). To him was Jesus’ mother </p>
<p>entrusted (19:27). Eventually, we are told that he is the one who wrote the </p>
<p>Gospel events (21:20–24). His intimacy with Jesus, closeness to Peter, his </p>
<p>presence at the cross, his participation in the Passover meal with Jesus and </p>
<p>other disciples (cf. Matt 26:20–24 par.; John 13:1), and his witness to the </p>
<p>life of Jesus by writing give us clues that he was one of the Twelve. Accord-</p>
<p>ing to the Synoptic tradition, Peter, James, and John constituted the inner </p>
<p>circle of the disciples (Mark 9:2; 14:33). e disciple whom Jesus loved is </p>
<p>distinguished from Peter (13:24; 20:1–10). Among James and John, James </p>
<p>was martyred early (Acts 12:2) and therefore there is a high probability for </p>
<p>John, the son of Zebedee, to be the front candidate to be called “the disciple </p>
<p>whom Jesus loved.”</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>His anonymity may indicate that this disciple is an</p>
<p>ideal disciple representing all believers who experience Jesus’ love.</p>
<p>In banquets, the participants reclined according to their status. In </p>
<p>many banquets, three persons were assigned to recline at one table. e one </p>
<p>reclined at Jesus’ right would have the opportunity to lean his head near </p>
<p>Jesus’ chest and thus the beloved disciple would have been sitting at the </p>
<p>right side of Jesus. is does not mean that John exalts the beloved disciple </p>
<p>over against Peter, who did not recline nearer to Jesus. Probably Judas was </p>
<p>reclining to Jesus’ le, which is a more honorable position, and this would </p>
<p>13. Michaels 2010: 749–50; Keener 2005: 2.917–18. e beloved disciple could have </p>
<p>been a former disciple of John the Baptist who began to follow Jesus in Judea (1:35–40) </p>
<p>up to and beyond the cross; Cullmann 1976: 71–78.</p>
