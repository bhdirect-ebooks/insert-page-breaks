<p>John 6:35–59</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>their physical death, unlike the bread eaten by their forefathers, who died </p>
<p>without enjoying eternal life. John concludes the discourse by stating that </p>
<p>Jesus taught these things in the synagogue at Capernaum (6:59; cf. 1:28; </p>
<p>8:20).</p>
<p>Jesus’ dialogue with his disciples (6:60–71)</p>
<p>Many of Jesus’ disciples did not accept his discourse due to their non-</p>
<p>understanding. ey murmured by saying, “is is a hard saying; who </p>
<p>can hear it?” (6:60–61). e hard and oensive saying, for them, was Jesus’ </p>
<p>heavenly origin and his teaching on eating his esh and drinking his blood, </p>
<p>for eating human esh and drinking blood were both forbidden in the Law. </p>
<p>eir question was how the things legally forbidden could lead one to eter-</p>
<p>nal life. ey did not understand the signicance of Jesus’ incarnation (i.e., </p>
<p>his coming down from heaven) and of the need to come to and believe </p>
<p>in the Word-become-esh who was sacriced on the cross (i.e., eating his </p>
<p>esh and drinking his blood), if they were to enjoy his life.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> eir conclu-</p>
<p>sion was that no one could accept such teachings. Jesus, by his supernatural </p>
<p>knowledge, knew of their grumbling at his teaching and asked them, “Do </p>
<p>you take oense at this?” (6:61).</p>
<p>If they take oense at his teaching on his coming down from heaven </p>
<p>and the need for humans to eat his esh and drink his blood, they would be </p>
<p>even more be oended if they were to see the Son of Man ascending to the </p>
<p>place of his origin (6:62). Jesus thus rearms his heavenly origin and as-</p>
<p>sures that he will ascend to heaven, the place where he was before, through </p>
<p>his death and resurrection (cf. 20:17). As his ascension will exhibit a greater </p>
<p>glory than his incarnation and death did, they will not believe his ascension </p>
<p>to the Father’s glory either (cf. 17:5). For Jesus the mystery of his incarna-</p>
<p>tion and manifestation of his glory on the cross can be comprehended only </p>
<p>in the Spirit (cf. John 4:14; 20:22; Gen 2:7). </p>
<p>e term “esh” in 6:63 means the fallen human nature in whose con-</p>
<p>trol people are living. Flesh is of no avail for understanding Jesus’ words, </p>
<p>for his words spoken are “spirit and life” (6:63b). e whole discourse hangs </p>
<p>on 6:63, which speaks of Jesus’ words as of the Spirit who gives life (cf. Ezek </p>
<p>37:1–14; Ps 104:29–30). What is true of “eating his esh and drinking his </p>
<p>blood,” which leads to eternal life, is also true with the Spirit’s activity in </p>
<p>human lives!</p>
