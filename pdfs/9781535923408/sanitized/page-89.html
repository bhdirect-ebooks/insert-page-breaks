<p>John 5:31–47</p>

<p>(5:43b). If they do not believe in Jesus, consequently they will fall prey to </p>
<p>lying prophets.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Jesus warns his opponents of the forthcoming judgment in which, not </p>
<p>Jesus, but Moses himself, in whom they have set their hope, will accuse </p>
<p>them of their unbelief in the one sent by their own God (5:45). “Moses” </p>
<p>symbolizes here the Law given through him (1:17) and written by him </p>
<p>(5:47). In fact, what Moses wrote was a prophecy of the coming of Christ </p>
<p>and in this sense, Moses wrote of Jesus (5:46). If they had really believed </p>
<p>in the Law that points to Jesus, then they would have accepted him as the </p>
<p>Messiah and believed in his words. “His [i.e., Moses’] writings” represents </p>
<p>the whole OT, which bears witness to Jesus (5:39). Jesus defends himself </p>
<p>that his words are foreshadowed in the OT writings. In Jesus’ attack on his </p>
<p>accusers as those who are blind to their own Law, the table is turned: the </p>
<p>accused becomes the accuser and the judges are judged in this trial-like </p>
<p>scene.</p>
