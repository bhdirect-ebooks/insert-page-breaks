<p>John 6:35–59</p>

<p>in this section, shows. e conditional clause, “If anyone eats of this bread, </p>
<p>that person will live for ever,” means that the one who eats of the bread from </p>
<p>heaven is not bound by death (6:50), but will have the end-time life forever </p>
<p>(6:51). Jesus denes the bread as his esh, which he will give for the life of </p>
<p>the world. is statement links 6:36–51 with 6:52–59 and looks forward </p>
<p>to the cross, where Jesus will give himself as a sacrice to conquer death </p>
and make divine life available for the “world,” i.e., for all people. e word
<p>“esh” is used perhaps to combat Docetism, a belief that the Logos only </p>
<p>appeared to be a man, by counter-arguing that Jesus was fully and really a </p>
<p>human being (John 1:14; 1 John 4:2). us, Jesus redenes the Passover in </p>
<p>terms of himself as the Passover lamb whose esh will be sacriced on the </p>
<p>cross for the life of whole humanity.</p>
<p>e necessity to eat his esh and drink his blood (6:52–59) </p>
<p>“e Jews” again took oence at Jesus’ identication of his esh with the </p>
<p>bread that is to be eaten. erefore they disputed among themselves by </p>
<p>questioning, “How can this fellow give us his esh to eat?” (6:52). is </p>
<p>question arose due to their partial understanding of what Jesus actually </p>
<p>meant. ey picked up the phrase “(eating) of my esh” but ignored that his </p>
<p>esh will be given “for the life of the world.” On hearing their dispute, Jesus </p>
<p>reiterates his statement by adding two important themes: the title “Son of </p>
<p>Man” and “drink his blood.” He solemnly arms the heavenly truth by his </p>
<p>“truly, truly, I say to you” phrase that “unless you eat the esh of the Son </p>
<p>of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you” (6:53). In 6:54 “Son </p>
<p>of Man” is replaced with the rst-person personal pronoun “my” and the </p>
<p>promise “I will raise him up at the last day” is added. Eating blood, in which </p>
<p>is the life of the esh, is strictly prohibited in the Law (Lev 17:10–12) and </p>
<p>therefore the Jews got oended. </p>
<p>Eating Jesus’ esh and drinking his blood have oen been interpreted </p>
<p>as denoting the Eucharist.</p>

<p>Lincoln thinks that the “Words of Institution”</p>
<p>from the Synoptic Gospels of the Last Supper have inuenced the forma-</p>
<p>tion in 6:53.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> But in 6:53–58 Jesus answers that he will oer his whole per-</p>
<p>son, esh and blood, in death on the cross so that those who eat and drink </p>
will have divine life within themselves.
