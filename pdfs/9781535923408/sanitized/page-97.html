<p>expectation that the Messiah, the second Redeemer, would give manna just </p>
<p>like Moses, the rst redeemer, did.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>e people who earlier questioned Jesus’ credibility to give bread from </p>
<p>heaven now beseech him, “Lord, always give us this bread” (6:34; cf. 4:15). </p>
<p>e question-answer format used in 6:25–34 is another use of John’s liter-</p>
<p>ary technique of non-understanding to project his Christology. e crowd </p>
<p>is led from its earthly understanding of “bread” to know Jesus as the life-</p>
<p>giving bread from heaven. </p>
<p>Jesus’ discourse on the living bread (6:35–59)</p>
<p>Jesus’ heavenly origin (6:35–51)</p>
<p>6:35–51 has the rst “I am” saying with a predicate in John (6:35, 41, 48, </p>
<p>51). e reference to Jesus having come down from heaven/God occurs </p>
<p>seven times.</p>
<p>To the people’s request to give them the bread of life, Jesus emphati-</p>
<p>cally says, “I am the bread of life” (6:35; cf. 6:48, 51; see comments on 4:26 </p>
<p>and 6:20 on the “I am” saying). “I am” basically means the self-revelation </p>
<p>of God in Jesus, denoting God’s eternal existence. e predicate indicates, </p>
<p>in addition, God’s communication with human beings. God communicates </p>
<p>himself in Jesus as life-giving food, the food that endures to eternal life </p>
<p>(6:27). People expected Jesus to supply them bread from heaven for their </p>
<p>livelihood. But Jesus’ armation “I am the bread of life” discloses that the </p>
<p>bread of God has already come down in human form to manifest God’s love </p>
for humanity and give them divine life. What was expected to come at the
<p>end of the age (Dan 12:2) is available now in Jesus! </p>
<p>“e one who comes to me” and “the one who believes in me” (6:35) </p>
<p>are parallels that interpret each other. e expressions “shall never hunger” </p>
<p>and “shall never thirst” convey the same idea: those who come to Jesus and </p>
<p>believe in him will have complete satisfaction in life without being domi-</p>
<p>nated by worldly desires or worries. is idea recalls God’s invitation to </p>
<p>come to him to eat and drink without money (Isa 55:1–2) and that of Wis-</p>
<p>dom to come to her to eat and drink so that people may walk with insight </p>
<p>(Prov 9:1–6). Jesus, the Wisdom of God, calls people to come to him by </p>
<p>faith so that they may have life in abundance (10:10b) without further need </p>
<p>for hunger or thirst for earthly things (cf. Sir 24:12). us, Jesus reveals and </p>
