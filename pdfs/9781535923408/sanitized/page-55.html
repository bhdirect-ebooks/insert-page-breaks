<p>John 2:23–25</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>In John faith based on “seeing” rather than on “hearing” the testimony </p>
<p>about Jesus or his words is not genuine faith (cf. 1:50). Since Jesus himself </p>
<p>knew all human beings and their secret thoughts (cf. 1:42, 47–48; 5:42; </p>
<p>6:15, 26, 61, 64; 16:19, 30), no human needs to bear witness about anyone </p>
<p>to Jesus (2:25). e supernatural knowledge of God is portrayed in the OT: </p>
<p>it is God alone who observes the deeds of all human beings and their secret </p>
<p>thoughts, because he has fashioned their hearts and observes their deeds </p>
<p>(Ps 7:9; 33:15; 139:1–24; Jer 17:10; cf. Wis 1:6). What is true with the God </p>
<p>of the OT is true with the Jesus that John portrays! Since Jesus is the Son </p>
<p>of God who is in oneness with the Father, no wonder he exhibits the same </p>
<p>omniscience as God. erefore Jesus did not entrust himself to those who </p>
<p>seemed to believe in him by seeing his signs (2:24). is shows that Jesus </p>
<p>expected the members of his society to believe in him with a commitment </p>
<p>not just by seeing the miracles he performed but by hearing his words.</p>
<p>Excursus: “Sign” in John</p>
<p>The word “sign” (se¯ meion in Greek) occurs seventeen times in John’s Gospel, </p>
<p>out of which thirteen times it occurs in plural. “Signs” denotes the miracles </p>
<p>of Jesus. In the Synoptic Gospels, the word “sign” bears mostly a negative </p>
<p>connotation, as Jesus refuses his opponents’ demand to perform a sign (Matt </p>
<p>12:38–39; 16:1, 4; Mark 8:11–12; Luke 11:16, 29; 23:8; cf. John 2:18). </p>
<p>Even false prophets and false Christs perform signs (Matt 24:24; Mark 13:22). </p>
<p>Nevertheless, signs foreshadow the coming of Christ in glory (Matt 24:3, 30; </p>
<p>Mark 13:4; Luke 21:7, 11, 25). The Greek version of Isa 8:18 has the word </p>
<p>se¯ meion with a non-miraculous connotation and in Ezek 4:3 the word indi-</p>
<p>cates the prophetic activity that anticipates a greater reality of which the sign </p>
<p>itself is a part. In Isa 66:18–19, se¯ meion is used to denote the eschatological </p>
<p>gathering of all nations to see his glory and the declaration of his glory among </p>
<p>the Gentiles by the survivors of the Jewish nation.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the same line, in all his signs in John, Jesus reveals God’s glory in </p>
<p>terms of his love and concern for humanity to fulﬁll their physical and spiritual </p>
<p>needs (e.g., 2:1–11; 6:26–27; 11:4, 40). Jesus’ signs (works) in John reveal </p>
<p>his oneness with the Father (5:18; 10:38) and his own identity as the Christ, </p>
<p>the Son of God, and the Son of Man (9:38; 11:25–27; 20:30–31). Through </p>
<p>a sign Jesus strengthened the faith of his disciples in him (2:11) and others </p>
<p>18. Barrett 1978: 75–78.</p>
