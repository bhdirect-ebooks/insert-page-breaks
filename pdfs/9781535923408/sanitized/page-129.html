<p>John 9:13–34</p>

<p>clay on the Sabbath (m. Šabb. 7:2). Some Pharisees concluded that Jesus </p>
<p>was not from God, as he transgressed the Sabbath law by performing heal-</p>
<p>ing. Other Pharisees questioned how Jesus, who had sinned, could do such </p>
signs, and thus there was a division among the Pharisees (9:16).
<p>3</p>
<p>Now the</p>
<p>discussion turns from healing to the healer. ey enquired the healed man </p>
<p>of his view about the man who opened his eyes (9:17). Ironically, the reli-</p>
<p>gious leaders, who should have gloried God for the healing of a man born </p>
<p>blind, trouble him to give his opinion on the healer! </p>
<p>e healed man confessed Jesus to be a “prophet,” a word that does </p>
<p>not mean the Messiah here. Popularly, a prophet was known as someone </p>
<p>close to God who has supernatural knowledge (cf. John 4:19; Luke 7:39) </p>
<p>and is endowed with extraordinary power from God to do miracles (Matt </p>
<p>21:46; Mark 6:15; Luke 24:19). e understanding of the healed man about </p>
<p>Jesus attains progress. </p>
<p>But the Pharisees, who are called “the Jews,” did not believe that the </p>
<p>man who was blind received his sight. Hence they called the man’s parents </p>
<p>for further investigation (9:18). ey asked the parents whether or not the </p>
<p>healed man is their son who was born blind and, if so, how he is able to </p>
<p>see now (9:19). His parents accepted that the man is their son who was </p>
<p>born blind, but denied any knowledge either of the manner in which he </p>
<p>got his sight or of the healer. ey suggest that “the Jews” question their </p>
<p>son instead, who is of age</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>and who can speak for himself (9:20–21). ey</p>
<p>answered thus out of fear for the religious authorities, who had already of-</p>
<p>cially decided to put those who confess Jesus as the Messiah out of the </p>
<p>synagogue (9:22–23; 12:42), which would involve permanent excommuni-</p>
<p>cation from the people of Israel and from all religious services.</p>
<p>Some scholars maintain that the reference to the Pharisees’ decision is </p>
<p>an anachronism, written back to the time of Jesus, for such a formal deci-</p>
<p>sion took place only aer 85 CE, when the “twelh benediction,” which </p>
<p>cursed all heretics, including Christians, was pronounced. Arguing so, </p>
<p>Martyn reads the story as a two-level drama in which the healed man rep-</p>
<p>resents not only those who were healed by Jesus in Jerusalem, but also those </p>
3. is is the rst time that John reports about the division among the Pharisees.
<p>4. As per Jewish law, the age to make legal response is at least thirteen; Barrett 1978: </p>
<p>361.</p>
