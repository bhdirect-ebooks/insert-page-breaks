<p>e Resurrection of Jesus</p>
<p>196</p>
<p>Some interpret the visit of the two disciples in terms of relationship </p>
<p>of the Johannine Christians to the wider church. For them the Johannine </p>
<p>community, represented by the beloved disciple, is one with the apostolic </p>
<p>church, represented by Peter, and has uniquely contributed to the Johan-</p>
<p>nine Christology. John mentions the beloved disciple as the one who be-</p>
<p>lieved rst in Jesus’ resurrection aer seeing its historical evidence,</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Peter as a witness to the empty tomb (20:6–7). Both faith and witness are </p>
<p>interrelated. ough the author sets the beloved disciple as an example of </p>
<p>faith, he does not view the two disciples as competitors to each other. Af-</p>
<p>ter seeing the empty tomb, both returned home together (20:10). Both the </p>
<p>disciples did not understand the scripture that testies to the necessity of </p>
<p>Jesus’ resurrection (20:9). e “scripture” may refer to Ps 16:10 (cf. Acts </p>
<p>2:31), but broadly to everything written about Christ in the Law of Moses, </p>
<p>the Prophets, and the Psalms (Luke 24:27, 44).</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Mary Magdalene, an apostle to the apostles (20:11–18) </p>
<p>Mary Magdalene plays a key role in John’s resurrection narrative. Obviously </p>
<p>soon she came and joined the two disciples at Jesus’ tomb. Aer the two </p>
<p>disciples le, she kept standing outside the tomb weeping. While crying, </p>
<p>she bent down to look for Jesus’ body into the tomb (20:11). She saw two </p>
<p>angels in white, one sitting at the head and one at the feet in the place where </p>
<p>Jesus had been laid (20:12; cf. Matt 28:3; Mark 16:5; Luke 24:4). ey asked </p>
<p>Mary, “Woman, why are you weeping?” (20:13a), implying that since Jesus </p>
<p>is risen from the dead there is no need to weep. Mary replied from outside </p>
<p>the tomb that she is weeping because somebody took away “my Lord” and </p>
<p>that she does not know where they have laid him (20:13b; cf. 20:2). </p>
<p>As Mary was speaking, the scene abruptly shis from a vision of an-</p>
<p>gels to a vision of the risen Lord! She turned around and saw Jesus standing. </p>
<p>However, she did not recognize him (20:14). Jesus asked, “Woman, why </p>
<p>are you weeping? Whom do you seek?” (20:15a). He knew why she was </p>
<p>weeping and whom she sought, but his questions serve as a preparation for </p>
<p>his self-revelation. Oen the risen Jesus conceals his identity from his dis-</p>
<p>ciples at least temporarily (e.g., John 21:4; Luke 24:16).</p>
