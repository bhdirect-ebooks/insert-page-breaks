<p>John 17:20–26</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>Jesus’ prayer for his expanding community (17:20–26) </p>
<p>Jesus does not pray only for his rst disciples, but also for those who will </p>
<p>believe the message of salvation preached by them (17:20; cf. 4:39). When </p>
<p>the believing community expands, one may expect disunity due to dierent </p>
<p>gis and views of its members, and therefore Jesus prays rst that they all </p>
<p>may be one. is will be possible only by showing love for one another and </p>
<p>by the indwelling power of the Father and the Son within them (17:21). </p>
<p>e mutual indwelling of the Father and Son is to bring all the believers </p>
<p>into one (10:38; 14:10–11, 23) so that the world may see Jesus in them and </p>
<p>believe that he, the one sent by the Father, has heavenly origin (cf. 17:8, </p>
<p>23). e perfect unity within God’s community is the centripetal force to </p>
<p>bring the “outsiders” unto faith in Jesus (10:16). e same oneness is de-</p>
<p>scribed in 17:22 as caused by God’s glory, which Jesus possessed and gave </p>
<p>to the believers (cf. 17:6). Now God’s community is progressing towards </p>
<p>completeness, which will make the world to comprehend that God loves his </p>
<p>community with the same love that he has for Jesus (17:23).</p>
<p>By calling God again “Father,” Jesus expresses his desire that the dis-</p>
<p>ciples whom God gave to him may be with him in the place where he is </p>
<p>(17:24a; cf. 14:2–3). is will enable the disciples to see Jesus’ glory, which </p>
<p>God gave him out of his love for Jesus before the foundation of the world </p>
<p>(cf. 17:24b, 5). e expression “they whom you have given me,” though it </p>
<p>focuses on the twelve disciples, refers also to others who believed in Jesus </p>
<p>during his ministry (e.g., 4:42; 9:35–38) and who will believe in future by </p>
<p>the preaching of eyewitnesses (17:20). Jesus’ glory is God’s glory (1:14), </p>
<p>which has already been given and manifested to Jesus’ disciples (17:22; </p>
<p>2:11), and at the end of the age they will see Jesus in his full glory by being </p>
<p>in the place where he is (cf. 1 John 3:2). e prayer thus gives a vision of the </p>
<p>believers’ eschatological destiny.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>At the end of his Pastoral Prayer, Jesus calls the Father, “O righteous </p>
<p>Father,” perhaps to emphasize God’s righteousness to make sinners righ-</p>
<p>teous if they believe in Jesus (16:8, 10). e world, which rejected Jesus, did </p>
<p>not know God (1:10; 8:19), but Jesus knows God, because he comes from </p>
<p>God and has seen him (17:25a; 6:46; 10:15). His disciples (“these men” in </p>
<p>Greek) too know that the Father sent Jesus (17:25b), the verb “to know” im-</p>
<p>plying “to believe.” e content of faith is that the Father sent Jesus, which </p>
