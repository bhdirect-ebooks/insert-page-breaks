<p>JOHN 3</p>
<p>Testimonies of Jesus and the Baptist</p>
John next narrates Jesus’ ministry to three individuals: Nicodemus, a
<p>Samaritan woman, and a royal ocial, who belong to Judea, Samaria, and </p>
<p>Galilee respectively (John 3–4). is shows that Jesus is interested in each </p>
individual and his purpose is to bring people of all cultures, regions, and
<p>languages into his community. </p>
<p>Jesus’ Testimony before Nicodemus (3:1–21) </p>
<p>Jesus’ dialogue with Nicodemus (3:1–12)</p>
<p>Nicodemus was a Jew, “a man of the Pharisees” and “a ruler of the Jews” </p>
<p>(3:1). e designation “ruler” shows his position in the Jewish council </p>
<p>(7:50–51). He was “the teacher of Israel” (3:10) who was searching for heav-</p>
<p>enly truth. So Nicodemus met Jesus, obviously in Jerusalem. By knowing </p>
<p>Nicodemus’s inner thirst, Jesus initiates his teaching on the necessity of new </p>
<p>birth in order to experience life in the kingdom of God (3:3, 5).</p>
<p>Nicodemus came to Jesus by night. It could have been for secrecy, be-</p>
<p>cause many Pharisees were opposing Jesus; or night-time could have been </p>
<p>simply a convenient time for him and Jesus; or it could be in line with the </p>
custom of the rabbis to study the Law and converse about divine things
<p>at night.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the twice-repeated remark that Nicodemus came</p>
<p>to Jesus at night (3:2; 19:39) makes the symbolic meaning more probable. </p>
<p>In John, “night” denotes darkness, an impossible time to do good work </p>
<p>and the absence of light causing people to stumble in life because of their </p>
<p>evil deeds (3:19–21; 9:4–5; 11:10; 12:35, 36, 46; 13:30). John thus implies </p>
<p>that Nicodemus came from the dark sphere of his life to Jesus, the Light </p>
<p>that enlightens every human. Nevertheless, many scholars take Nicodemus </p>
<p>negatively.</p>

<p>However, John seems to admire the initial stage of Nicodemus’s</p>
