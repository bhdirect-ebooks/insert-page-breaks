<p>knowledge. is promise is given also for all Jesus’ followers, as the plural </p>
<p>“you [will see]” in 1:51 shows.</p>
<p>e community of disciples will see greater things throughout Jesus’ </p>
<p>life and ministry. Jesus’ promise is introduced with his solemn declaration, </p>
<p>“Truly, truly I say to you,” which appears twenty-ve times in the Johnnine </p>
<p>sayings of Jesus. is implies that Jesus pronounces a heavenly truth that </p>
<p>is conrmed and unchangeable. He promises a vision that will be seen col-</p>
<p>lectively by all those who believe in Jesus.</p>
<p>God’s new community, emerged around Jesus, will see “heaven </p>
<p>opened” and get a vision of God’s glory (Ezek 1:1; Mark 1:10; Acts 7:56; </p>
<p>Rev 4:1; 11:19; cf. 1 Kgs 22:19; Dan 7:13; Matt 26:64; Mark 14:62; Rev 12:1; </p>
<p>15:1; etc.). It will see the angels of God ascending and descending on the </p>
<p>Son of Man, just like Jacob saw (Gen 28:12–17). Jacob saw the angels of </p>
<p>God ascending and descending on a ladder and at the top of it he saw the </p>
<p>Lord God, who revealed himself to Jacob as the God of his fathers. </p>
<p>e Johannine Jesus replaces Jacob’s ladder with the Son of Man on </p>
<p>whom the angels were ascending and descending. is means that just as </p>
<p>Jacob’s ladder was the means of communication between earth and heaven, </p>
<p>John portrays the Son of Man, Jesus, as the way from earth to heaven (John </p>
<p>14:6) and the means of communication with God. Moreover, there is no </p>
<p>reference in John for the presence of God who revealed himself to Jacob </p>
<p>(Gen 28:13–15). However, for John one can see the same God in the Son </p>
<p>of Man. us Jesus, the Son of Man, becomes to all people both the way to </p>
<p>heaven and the revelation of God’s glory. </p>
<p>e idea of the Son of Man as the mediator between heaven and earth </p>
<p>is based on Daniel’s vision of “one like a son of man,” who is the representa-</p>
<p>tive of both God and the saints of the Most High and through whom God’s </p>
<p>people will possess God’s kingdom, dominion, and authority (Dan 7:9–27). </p>
<p>It is possible that Jesus picked up the title “Son of Man” for himself from </p>
<p>Daniel 7 to denote the communication between God and humanity.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>At</p>
<p>the same time, the term “son of man” was used to refer to the “man of God’s </p>
<p>right hand,” implying the “anointed one of God” (Ps 80:17). When John </p>
<p>was written, the Jews understood the title “Son of Man” in terms of the </p>
<p>“Elect One” of God or the “Christ” (1 En. 37–71; 4 Ezra 12–13). In John, </p>
<p>43. In the OT the term “son of man” means a mere mortal human being (e.g., Ps 8:4; </p>
<p>Ezek 2:1; 3:1; 4:1; etc.), but Dan 7:13–14 shows “the son of man” as a heavenly being who </p>
<p>comes with the clouds of heaven. In view of John’s constant emphasis that Jesus came </p>
<p>from heaven (e.g., 3:13; 6:38, 41–42, 50–51; 8:23), we should understand the title “Son of </p>
<p>Man” against the background of Dan 7.</p>
