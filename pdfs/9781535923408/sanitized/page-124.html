<p>Jesus’ Verbal Attack on the Hostile Jews</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>e Greek word diabolos (“devil”) means “the one who separates,” “the </p>
<p>enemy,” or “the seducer.” He vigorously attempts to separate people from </p>
<p>God and make them to worship him. He seduces people by his lies, makes </p>
<p>them believe falsehood to be the truth, and drives people to sin by fullling </p>
<p>his desires (cf. 1 John 3:8). us a liar becomes the father of those who </p>
<p>speak lies. at he was a “murderer from the beginning” may allude to his </p>
<p>act of separating Adam and Eve from their Maker even in the beginning of </p>
<p>the world and bringing sin and death upon every one (Rom 5:12–14; Wis </p>
<p>2:24; Sir 25:24). It may also recall the rst physical murder, committed by </p>
<p>Cain against his brother Abel (Gen 4:8; 1 John 3:12).</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>e devil does not</p>
<p>live in the sphere of truth and therefore his children do not believe the one </p>
<p>who came to disclose the truth, the heavenly reality (8:45).</p>
<p>At this point, Jesus challenges them by asking which of them convicts </p>
<p>him of sin. e implied answer is that no one can, because he is from above </p>
<p>and possesses the life of God. Jesus also asks them why they do not believe </p>
<p>him if he speaks the truth (8:46). Jesus’ answer for his own question is that </p>
<p>“the Jews” are not born of God (8:47), for any one who is born of God hears </p>
<p>and obeys the words of God spoken by him (cf. John 1:12–13; 1 John 3:9, </p>
<p>10; 4:4, 6; 5:18–19). e conict between Jesus and “the Jews” anticipates </p>
<p>the conict between Christians and the religious authorities in the late rst </p>
<p>century.</p>
<p>Existence of Jesus before Abraham (8:48–59) </p>
<p>Jesus’ verbal attack on his opponents aggravate them and to justify them-</p>
<p>selves they call Jesus a Samaritan who has a demon (8:48, 52; cf. 4:9). How-</p>
<p>ever, Jesus denies emphatically that he has a demon. ey thus dishonor </p>
<p>him, but Jesus honors his Father (8:49). Anyone who does not honor the </p>
<p>Son does not honor the Father either (5:23). Jesus’ rebuke against their dis-</p>
<p>honor does not mean that he seeks glory for himself. For him, God, who </p>
<p>judges fairly, seeks his glory (8:50; cf. 5:41; 7:18). </p>
<p>On the surface, Jesus uses the image of a lawsuit with his adversaries </p>
<p>before the tribunal of God</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>to say that God is the ultimate judge, who will</p>
<p>bring glory to Jesus. At a deeper level, Jesus declares that the way in which </p>
<p>God seeks to glorify his Son is through his death on the cross (12:23, 32, </p>
<p>33; 13:31–32; 17:1, 4, 5). Jesus’ enemies, due to their unbelief, have placed </p>
