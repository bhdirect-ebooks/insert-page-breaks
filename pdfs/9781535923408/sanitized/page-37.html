<p>John 1:14, 16–18</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>to God’s mercy and initiative to forgive the sins of his people, who dis-</p>
<p>obeyed his covenant, and to God’s faithfulness to put the Law within their </p>
<p>hearts as the mark of making a new covenant (Exod 34:6–7; Jer 31:31–34; </p>
<p>Ezek 36:22–32). By being in the “bosom of the Father,” Jesus alone knows </p>
<p>God in the most intimate way and therefore he alone can reveal God to the </p>
<p>world in his mercy and faithfulness (John 1:18; cf. 10:14–15; 14:10–11). </p>
<p>e whole Gospel, according to the prologue, evolves around one </p>
<p>theme: the revelation of the one God in his glory and his encounter with all </p>
<p>human beings in the life and mission of Jesus, the pre-existent God-become-</p>
<p>esh, to found and nurture a witnessing new covenant community. </p>
<p>Excursus: The Understanding of the Logos in the First Century CE</p>
<p>The ﬁrst-century Jews treated the Logos as Wisdom and the Law in their pre-</p>
<p>existence with the Creator (Prov 8:22–31; Sir 1:1–10; 24:3; Prov 3:19–20; </p>
<p>Wis 9:1–2; Bar 3:9–4:4; 1 En. 42; Sir 15:1; 19:20; 39:1; 24:23; 34:8; </p>
<p>39:1; 4 Macc 1:16–17) and as the creative word used by God in creation </p>
<p>(Gen 1; cf. Ps 33:6, 9). For them the Logos accomplishes God’s mission (Isa </p>
<p>9:8–9; 55:11) and brings healing and deliverance (Ps 107:20), a means by </p>
<p>which God’s will and message were communicated (Jer 1:4; Ezek 1:3; 6:1; </p>
<p>Amos 3:1, 8). They understood the Logos as the Aramaic memra, a periphra-</p>
<p>sis for God and his powerful acts (e.g., Tg. Exod. 19:17; 31:13; Tg. Onq. Gen. </p>
<p>3:8; Tg. Isa. 48:13).</p>
<p>The Greeks understood the Logos as reason or the rational principle that </p>
<p>is behind the world to keep it in order and within every human being. For </p>
<p>the Stoics, the Logos controls the stars and seasons and pervades all things. </p>
<p>Although one can be united with God through the Logos (Corp. herm. 13.6–7), </p>
<p>reason can be built up in a person only after the immortal soul gets rid of </p>
<p>bodily senses by escaping from the prison of the body. This is called “rebirth” </p>
<p>(Corp. herm. 13.7–8).</p>
<p>The Hellenistic Jewish understanding of the Logos is known from Philo’s </p>
<p>writings. For Philo the Logos is a real being distinct from God and an interme-</p>
diary between God and the world (Her. 2–5). Logos is the divine reason (Cher.
<p>36), the second God (QG 2.62), God himself (without the deﬁnite article; </p>
<p>Somn. 1.229–30). To perceive the Logos is to perceive the invisible God, for </p>
<p>the Logos is that by which God draws the perfect man from earthly things </p>
<p>to himself (Sac. 8). The unknowable God is knowable as Light through the </p>
