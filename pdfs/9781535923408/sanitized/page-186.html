<p>JOHN 16</p>
<p>Jesus’ Pastoral Speech III</p>
<p>Intensification of the world’s hatred (16:1–4) </p>
<p>Jesus’ opening statement, “I have said all these to you,” refers back to 15:18–</p>
<p>27, and his purpose of saying it is that they do not go astray (16:1; cf. Mark </p>
<p>14:27–31). Jesus wants his disciples to stand rm in faith in the phase of </p>
<p>aiction. He warns them specically that they will be put out of the syna-</p>
<p>gogue by the Jewish authorities (9:22; 12:42) and that they will even kill </p>
<p>them, assuming that by doing so they are rendering service to God (16:2; cf. </p>
<p>Num 25:7–13). e teachers of the Law will kill Jesus’ followers, mistaking </p>
<p>them for heretics and breakers of the Law. is prediction is linked with </p>
<p>the statement, “An hour is coming,” which looks forward to the time of </p>
<p>Christians being killed and their exclusion from Jewish society, aer Jesus’ </p>
<p>hour of self-sacrice on the cross. Such murderous act of Jesus’ opponents </p>
<p>against Christians took place aer his ascension (e.g., Acts 7:58–60; 12:1–3; </p>
<p>Ant. 20.9.1).</p>
<p>e reason for such persecution was that the authorities had no inti-</p>
<p>mate relationship with the Father and with Jesus (16:3; cf. 15:21). “Knowing </p>
<p>Jesus” will lead to know also the Father (8:19). e persecutors did not </p>
<p>know both because of their unbelief in Jesus (5:38) and their hatred to-</p>
<p>wards Jesus’ community (15:18). Jesus was saying all things in advance to </p>
<p>his followers so that when they are killed by Jesus’ enemies at “their hour” </p>
<p>they may remember that Jesus had already said those things and believe in </p>
<p>him (16:4a; 13:19; 14:29). “Remembering what Jesus said” will give them </p>
<p>new insight into Jesus’ sayings and courage to face suering and death. He </p>
<p>did not tell them about his departure and the world’s hatred from the time </p>
<p>they had joined him (cf. 15:27 for “from the beginning”), because he was </p>
<p>with them (16:4b). In his presence, the disciples experienced Jesus’ love </p>
<p>and protection, and there was no need to speak of such matters in the early </p>
<p>stage lest they dri away from faith. </p>
