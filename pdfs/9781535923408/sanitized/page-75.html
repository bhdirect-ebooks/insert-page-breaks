<p>John 4:27–38</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>the case of God’s mission, the opportunity to liberate people from bondage </p>
<p>and to bring them into the new community is already present. e meta-</p>
<p>phorical saying of Jesus, “Li up your eyes and see the elds that they are </p>
<p>already white for harvest” (4:35b), is to give awareness to his followers of </p>
<p>the existing opportunity for ministry. e “elds” may indicate the people </p>
<p>and “being white for harvest” metaphorically implies their readiness to </p>
<p>receive Jesus’ words and believe in him. e word “harvest” denotes the </p>
<p>currently available season to involve oneself in Christ’s work of compassion </p>
<p>(Matt 9:36–38; Luke 10:2). e “harvest” time also indicates the time of </p>
<p>judgment given to the evildoers at the end-time (Matt 13:24–30, 36–43; </p>
<p>Mark 4:26–29). e salvation in Jesus contains in itself also condemnation </p>
<p>for those who do not believe in him. Jesus calls his followers to participate </p>
<p>in the harvest. </p>
<p>e eschatological element in the “harvest” is conrmed by Jesus’ </p>
<p>statement that the one who is involved in the harvest faithfully will receive </p>
<p>in future the reward of heavenly life, which is also a present experience </p>
<p>(John 4:36; cf. Rev 22:12; John 3:14–15). Two ideas become visible: First, </p>
<p>the task of reaping is nothing but gathering fruit of what has already been </p>
<p>sown, as per the proverbial saying, “One sows and another reaps” (4:37). </p>
<p>Secondly, God’s mission includes a prior sowing. e people who believe </p>
<p>and join God’s new community by the collective labor of the sower and </p>
<p>reaper are the “fruit” of the harvest. Jesus sends the members of his society </p>
<p>to reap that which they did not sow, but “others” have done the sowing </p>
<p>already (4:38). </p>
<p>e mission entrusted by Jesus to his followers involves teamwork, </p>
<p>which, at the gathering of fruit, brings joy for all involved. Who does Jesus </p>
<p>mean by the “others” who have labored? e reaping of Jesus’ followers will </p>
<p>be the result of Jesus’ accomplishment of the Father’s work on the cross. </p>
<p>e church’s mission ultimately ows from the Father who sent Jesus on a </p>
<p>mission of saving the world. e church’s mission now is the continuation </p>
<p>of Jesus’ mission (17:18; 20:21). e ministry of the OT prophets and kings </p>
<p>and the preparatory work of John the Baptist all led up to the redemp-</p>
<p>tive work of Jesus. us, the seed sown for the harvest to be done by the </p>
<p>church is Jesus’ labor, accomplished with the authority of the Father. Both </p>
<p>the Father and the Son are thus involved in the redemptive work. If so, </p>
<p>“others” in 4:38 refers to the labor of sowing already done by the Father and </p>
<p>the Son together, who have le the harvest to the members of God’s new </p>
