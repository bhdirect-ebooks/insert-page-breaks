<p>John 13:21–30</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>night.” It is a symbol of Judas entering into darkness by leaving the Light of </p>
<p>the world.</p>
<p>e new commandment (13:31–35)</p>
<p>As there are several themes that link this passage with John 14–16, some </p>
<p>commentators treat 13:31–38 as part of Jesus’ farewell discourse.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>When</p>
<p>Judas had gone out, Jesus said to the remaining eleven disciples, “Now is </p>
<p>the Son of Man gloried, and God is gloried in him” (13:31). e temporal </p>
<p>“now” is in an emphatic position to emphasize that the hour of glorication </p>
<p>is already in operation. Jesus, the Son of Man, will be gloried on the cross </p>
<p>(3:14; cf. 8:54; 11:4; 12:23). In the crucied Son of Man, God is gloried in </p>
<p>the sense that God’s love and life-giving power are revealed.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> e glorica-</p>
<p>tion of God and of Jesus is always mutual, because they share one glory </p>
<p>(1:14; 5:23). is mutuality is conrmed in 13:32 with an added reference </p>
<p>to the end-time glorication of both of them. If God is gloried in the suf-</p>
<p>fering and death of the Son of Man, he will also glorify him in himself. e </p>
<p>future “he will glorify him” implies that God will accept Jesus in his own </p>
<p>presence immediately (“at once”) with the same glory that he had possessed </p>
<p>with God before the existence of the world (17:5, 24). </p>
<p>Jesus addresses his disciples as “little children” (teknia) in 13:33. It </p>
<p>shows his aection for his own and their unity as a family. en he discloses </p>
<p>that yet a little while he will be with them and that they will seek him, but </p>
<p>they will not be able to nd him and also they cannot go to the place where </p>
<p>Jesus will go (13:33; cf. 7:33–34). </p>
<p>Jesus gives them a new commandment that “you love one another, just </p>
<p>as I loved you, that you also love one another” (13:34; cf. 15:17). e Greek </p>
word agapān, translated “to love,” implies “divine love,” for it denotes the
<p>self-giving love of God (3:16). e word “commandment” points to the di-</p>
<p>vine necessity and carries moral overtones. It is called the “new command-</p>
<p>ment” because “loving one another,” which is repeated thrice in 13:34–35, </p>
<p>is the fulllment of all the Law and the prophets (Deut 6:5; Lev 19:18; Matt </p>
<p>22:35–40 par.; Luke 10:25–28; Rom 13:8–10). It is the essence of life in </p>
<p>God’s new community, for it is only by seeing the love shared among the </p>
<p>19. E.g., Carson 1991: 476–510; Köstenberger 2009: 419; Lincoln 2006: 381–83. Mi-</p>
<p>chaels (2010: 761–63) takes 13:36–38 along with 14:1–31.</p>
<p>20. e word “gloried” is put in aorist tense in Greek, meaning that in Judas’ plan to </p>
<p>betray Jesus the Son of Man and God have been gloried once and for all.</p>
