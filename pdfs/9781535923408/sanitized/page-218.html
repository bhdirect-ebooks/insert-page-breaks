<p>and a thick red uid below. e spear would have pierced the pleural cavity </p>
<p>(i.e., between the rib cage and the lung), and the two parts of the blood </p>
<p>could have come out unmixed.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>e ow of blood and water from Jesus’ side is important because it </p>
<p>shows that the one who saw it has borne witness so that the readers may be-</p>
<p>lieve (19:35). By recording this, John may prove the humanity of Jesus (cf. </p>
<p>1 John 5:6). However, John’s point goes beyond this interpretation. Some </p>
<p>understand the blood against the background of 6:52–59 and the water in </p>
<p>light of 7:38–39.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>Others see it against the background of Isa 53 and still</p>
<p>others see the blood and water as representing the sacraments by which the </p>
<p>church is built up.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Most of the interpretations proposed do not take up</p>
<p>“blood and water” together as one entity.</p>
<p>19:34b can better be understood in the light of 1 John 5:6–10,</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>which</p>
<p>speaks of Jesus’ incarnation as his coming by water and blood. is theme </p>
<p>is linked with the testimony of the Spirit and with the necessity of believ-</p>
<p>ing in the Son of God of whom God has testied. e same motifs occur </p>
<p>in 19:34–35. at the Spirit, the water, and the blood are “to the one” (1 </p>
<p>John 5:8) means that the Spirit, the water, and the blood agree together to </p>
<p>proclaim the truth that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, by believing in </p>
<p>whom one can have eternal life.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e ow of blood and water proves not only that the Logos came in </p>
<p>esh, but also that the Spirit (symbolized by “water”), which is to be given </p>
<p>aer Jesus’ glorication (7:39), brings new life (symbolized by “blood”), </p>
<p>which ows from the crucied Christ.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>ose who believe will experience</p>
<p>the love and new life of the Spirit found on the cross. us, the Spirit, blood, </p>
<p>and water bear witness together to Jesus as the giver of life. is witness is </p>
<p>done through the disciple who was an eyewitness to what happened on </p>
<p>the cross (19:35). e Johannine community attests that the content of the </p>
<p>disciple’s witness is true, because he speaks the truth (cf. 21:24). “Bearing </p>
<p>witness” could be not only by words, but also by putting such a vision in </p>
<p>writing (cf. 21:25) so that those who hear and read might believe (cf. 20:31). </p>
