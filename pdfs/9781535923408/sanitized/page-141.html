<p>John 10:40–42</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>who came to the world to reveal God’s love and faithfulness to his own </p>
<p>covenant with his people.</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons </p>
<p>The imagery of sheep and shepherd is used in the OT to describe the cov-</p>
<p>enantal relationship between Yahweh and his people, and in the NT it explains </p>
<p>the intimate relationship that exists between Jesus and God’s new community. </p>
<p>Today it shows us the characteristics of a Christian leader/pastor in relation </p>
<p>to his/her people (cf. Eph 4:11 where “pastors” are known as poimenas, </p>
<p>“shepherds”; 1 Pet 5:4). As a model shepherd-leader, Jesus shows love for </p>
<p>his people and equally does justice by punishing the wicked and leading the </p>
<p>believers in spiritual warfare.</p>

<p>I know a pastor in India who used to carry food, clothing, and other </p>
<p>needed things to the people of his congregation when they were caught by </p>
<p>natural calamities such as ﬂood and drought. He used to help the poor by giv-</p>
<p>ing money, clothing, and textbooks for children whenever they needed them. </p>
<p>At the same time, he used to be strict in administering the institutions that </p>
<p>were under his management, punishing wrongdoers and admiring those who </p>
<p>performed well. Most of the people loved him and I have appreciated his care </p>
<p>for his own ﬂock.</p>
<p>Another pastor whom I know used to go to meet with his people, risking </p>
<p>his own life, whenever they were in danger of being attacked by their adver-</p>
<p>saries belonging to another caste group in the village. The pastor’s presence </p>
<p>has saved his congregation members several times from the hands of their </p>
<p>enemies. Still another pastor saved one of his congregation members from the </p>
<p>hands of police when he was dragged into the police station with false accusa-</p>
<p>tions. He delivered the man by talking with the concerned police ofﬁcers and </p>
<p>explaining what actually happened. </p>
<p>These are the glimpses of Christian leaders who, by following Jesus, have </p>
<p>demonstrated themselves as model shepherds by giving themselves for the </p>
<p>welfare of the people given to them.</p>
