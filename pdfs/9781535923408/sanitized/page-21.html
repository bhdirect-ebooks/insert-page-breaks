<p>Introduction</p>

<p>e statement “is is the disciple who . . . has written these things” </p>
<p>(21:24) does not necessarily imply that he wrote the Gospel as we have it </p>
<p>today. e assumption that John the Son of Zebedee, a Galilean Jew, wrote </p>
<p>the whole of John ignores the numerous Judean elements that the Gospel </p>
<p>contains, including the correct geographical references to the events that </p>
<p>took place in Judea.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>True, John, being a leader in Jerusalem church, would</p>
<p>have known well the places and practices in Judea. However, the numer-</p>
<p>ous parallels between John and the Qumran documents, the underlying </p>
<p>rabbinic and targumic traditions, John’s christological apologetic rooted in </p>
<p>the OT, and the reinterpreted Jewish mysticism, etc. presented in John far </p>
<p>exceed the possible intellectual knowledge of a Galilean sherman.</p>
<p>Hengel contends that the author of the Fourth Gospel, John the Elder, </p>
<p>being a Jew from Jerusalem, migrated at the verge of the fall of Jerusalem </p>
<p>in 66–70 CE to Asia Minor, most probably to Ephesus, where he started a </p>
<p>school, normally known as the Johannine School.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> However, we have evi-</p>
<p>dence for the migration of John the Son of Zebedee to Ephesus. e apoc-</p>
<p>ryphal Acts of John (ca. 150–60 CE) shows that John was widely involved </p>
<p>in evangelistic and pastoral ministry in Asia, including Ephesus.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Irenaeus</p>
<p>(ca. 130–200 CE) had heard Polycarp (ca. 70 CE–160 CE), who received </p>
<p>information about the works and words of the Lord from the eyewitnesses, </p>
<p>including John (Eccl. Hist. 5.20.4). Irenaeus writes that John the disciple of </p>
<p>the Lord ministered in the church in Ephesus, founded by Paul, until the </p>
<p>time of Trajan (98–117 CE; Eccl. Hist. 3.23.3–4; cf. 5.8.4). </p>
<p>Dionysius of Alexandria (the third century CE) indicates that there </p>
<p>are in Ephesus tombs of two Johns (see Eccl. Hist. 3.23.6; 7.25.16; cf. 3.31.3; </p>
<p>3.39.6; 5.24.3 for Polycrates’ conrmation that the resting place of John was </p>
<p>in Ephesus). e Apostolic Constitutions (third century CE) mentions that </p>
<p>the apostle John installed another John in Ephesus as his successor. Papias </p>
<p>refers to two Johns in his writing (125–35 CE), in the context of his enquiry </p>
<p>with those who had contacts with some of the disciples of Jesus about “what </p>
<p>John and Matthew said” and about “the things which Aristion and John the </p>
<p>elder, the disciples of the Lord, say” (Eccl. Hist. 3.39.4).</p>
<p>Jesus loved is an anonymous, but historical, gure who was not one of the twelve, but </p>
<p>who was probably a man from Jerusalem. However, their arguments for later position </p>
<p>are not as convincing as their original arguments for the beloved disciple as the son of </p>
<p>Zebedee. </p>
