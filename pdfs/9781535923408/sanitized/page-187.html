<p>John 16:5–15</p>
<p>159</p>
<p>The functions of the Spirit (16:5–15) </p>
<p>“But now” indicates a chronological change and links 16:5 with 16:4b. Jesus </p>
<p>tells his disciples that he is going to the Father who sent him, because now </p>
<p>the Father’s hour has come (12:23; 13:1). He notes that none of them asks </p>
<p>him, “Where are you departing?” (16:5). en he himself arms that since </p>
<p>he talked about the forthcoming persecution to his disciples and his depar-</p>
<p>ture to the Father, grief has lled their hearts (16:6). Peter had earlier asked, </p>
<p>“Lord, where are you going?” (13:36). omas too questioned Jesus about </p>
<p>the way to the place where Jesus was going to (14:5). Yet Jesus says, “And </p>
<p>none of you asks me, ‘Where are you departing?’” Some scholars nd two </p>
<p>versions of a farewell discourse (13:31—14:31 and 15:1—16:33) that have </p>
<p>been combined together without bothering about contradictions.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Others</p>
<p>suggest that Jesus was not saying that the question was not asked before, but </p>
<p>that now no one was asking. However, the word “now” is to be read with </p>
<p>Jesus’ departure to the Father and not with the disciples’ asking.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>As the</p>
<p>disciples’ hearts were lled with sorrow over Jesus’ departure, they could </p>
<p>not ask where he was going. Also, Jesus had already told them that he was </p>
<p>going to the Father who sent him (7:33; 14:2–7, 28)</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>and so there is no need</p>
<p>to ask now about Jesus’ destination.</p>
<p>e adversative conjunction “but” that begins 16:7 shows that Jesus’ </p>
<p>departure is not a matter of sorrow, but of joy, for it is to their advantage </p>
<p>that he goes away. If only he goes, then he will send the Paraclete (the Spirit </p>
<p>of truth), the helping presence of God, to be with them, and if he does not </p>
<p>go away, the Spirit will not come to them. e emphatic statement, “But I </p>
<p>tell you the truth,” means that Jesus’ sending of the Spirit is a conrmed </p>
<p>heavenly truth, which he normally expresses by the statement “truly, truly, </p>
<p>I say to you.” e functions of the Spirit are expressed now in relation to the </p>
<p>world (16:8–11). “When he comes” (16:8) indicates the voluntariness of the </p>
<p>Spirit to come to the disciples.</p>
<p>e Paraclete will convict the world about sin, righteousness, and </p>
<p>judgment (16:8). e Greek verb elenkhein (“to convict, convince”) has </p>
<p>a forensic tone, meaning “to expose” one’s evil deeds (3:20) or “to prove </p>
<p>someone guilty” or “to convict” someone as ungodly or a transgressor </p>
<p>(8:46; 1 Cor 14:24; Jas 2:9; Jude 15) or “to rebuke” (1QH 9.23). e word </p>
