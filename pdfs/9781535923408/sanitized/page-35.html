<p>John 1:14, 16–18</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>to the Lord’s dwelling in the midst of the people of Israel on the day when </p>
<p>many nations will join themselves to be his people (Zech 2:10–11; cf. Rev </p>
<p>7:15; 21:3).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>In this eschatological framework, the phrase “among us” does</p>
<p>not indicate only the people of Israel, but broadly all human beings. us, </p>
<p>in the coming of the Logos in human esh, the end-time has dawned.</p>
<p>However, the personal pronoun “we” in “we beheld his glory” (1:14c) </p>
<p>points exclusively to those who, by faith, could see and experience God’s </p>
<p>glory in the Logos incarnate. It need not be conned only to eyewitnesses </p>
<p>or to the Johannine community. For unbelievers, however, the glory of God </p>
<p>revealed in esh remains hidden.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>“Seeing God’s glory” can be connected</p>
<p>with the tabernacle and the temple, where one can see God’s presence or </p>
<p>his glory (Exod 24:15–17; 25:8; 40:35; 1 Kgs 8:10, 11, 13). e temple is also </p>
<p>the place where God put his name to dwell (1 Kgs 8:29; 9:3; 2 Chr 6:20). For </p>
<p>John the name of God that dwelt in the tabernacle/temple and God’s glory </p>
<p>that was seen by the Israelites are the same, and now they are revealed in </p>
<p>Jesus, the incarnate Logos (cf. 17:11–12 with 17:22, 26). </p>
<p>Moses saw God’s glory in terms of his steadfast love and faithfulness </p>
<p>(Exod 33:18–19; 34:6–7), which are equivalent to the twin words “grace </p>
<p>and truth” (1:14). Jesus was bearing God’s glory even in Jesus’ pre-existent </p>
<p>state (17:5, 24). It marks the oneness between them, on one hand, and the </p>
<p>oneness between the believers, on the other (17:22). In this context, “glory” </p>
<p>can mean the eternal relationship of love that exists between the Father and </p>
<p>the Son (17:24b).</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>In the light of Lazarus’ resurrection (11:4, 40), God’s</p>
<p>glory may also indicate God’s saving power</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>or God’s love expressed in his</p>
<p>generosity to restore life.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>e glory seen in the Son was God’s splendor,</p>
manifested in his love and faithfulness to his covenant to give divine life.
<p>e idea of seeing God’s glory in esh could be a polemic against the then-</p>
<p>prevalent interest in mystical visions to see God in heaven in his kingly </p>
<p>glory and in human form.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e sharing of glory by the Father and the Son, a mark of oneness </p>
<p>between them, is conrmed by the Greek word monogenēs (“only Son”), </p>
<p>used four times in John (1:14, 18; 3:16, 18; cf. Wis 7:22 LXX). e word </p>
