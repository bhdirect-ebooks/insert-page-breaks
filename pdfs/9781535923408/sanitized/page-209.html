<p>a prisoner happened with some regularity.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Matthew and Mark read that it</p>
<p>was the custom of the governor to release any one prisoner whom the Jews </p>
<p>wanted (Matt 27:15; Mark 15:6). is means that there was a Jewish custom </p>
<p>to ask the governor to release a prisoner of their choice.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Since Pilate was</p>
<p>convinced that Jesus did not claim to be a king in a political sense, he did </p>
<p>not hesitate to use the title “King of the Jews” (19:14–15, 19–22) and release </p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>e Jewish opponents, however, did not want Jesus to be released, </p>
<p>because they had already decided to put him to death by instigating the </p>
<p>Roman ocials. ey cried again, “Not this man, but Barabbas.” John men-</p>
<p>tions that Barabbas was a robber (cf. Mark 15:7; Luke 23:19) to sharply </p>
<p>contrast him from Jesus, the King of the Jews (18:40). Ironically, “the Jews” </p>
<p>wanted Jesus to be put to death as if he was posing a political threat, but </p>
<p>asked to release a man who was truly a political criminal.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>Jesus takes the</p>
<p>place of Barabbas who represents sinful humanity as a whole!</p>
