<p>disturb them. Jesus’ subsequent command that any one who was without </p>
<p>sin may rst throw a stone at her (8:7) convicted them of their own sins. Je-</p>
<p>sus’ words, along with the power of his writing done on the ground with his </p>
<p>nger (8:8), persuaded them, beginning from the elders, to leave the place </p>
<p>fast. Jesus easily turned the table against his enemies and made those who </p>
<p>judged others dishonestly themselves become the accused. ereby he not </p>
<p>only acquitted the woman from condemnation (8:11), but also brought the </p>
<p>accusers under condemnation. Jesus’ authority to judge (5:22, 27) reversed </p>
<p>the condemnation of sinners (cf. 3:17).</p>
<p>Although Jesus delivered the woman from condemnation, he did not </p>
<p>condone her sin. He commanded her to go and sin no more (8:11). e </p>
divine forgiveness and liberation from condemnation mercifully granted
<p>by Jesus persuades and enables forgiven sinners not to remain in sin. By </p>
<p>acquitting and transforming the woman’s life, Jesus enabled her to obey the </p>
<p>commandment not to commit adultery!</p>
<p>Jesus, the Light of the world (8:12–20) </p>
<p>e word “again” may link Jesus’ sayings in 8:12–20 with his sayings in John </p>
<p>7. e forensic language used does not mean that the trial of Jesus con-</p>
<p>tinues here from John 7.</p>

<p>We have here the dialogue, in severe conicting</p>
<p>terms, between Jesus and the crowd, and not a formal trial.</p>

<p>e audience</p>
<p>is a mixed group of Pharisees (8:13), “the Jews” (8:22, 48, 52, 57), and the </p>
<p>believing Jews (8:31).</p>
<p>Jesus claims himself as the Light of the world by using “I am,” the sec-</p>
<p>ond of the seven such sayings in John. e proposed Isaianic background </p>
<p>of Yahweh’s lawsuit against Israel</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>does not t into Jesus’ “I am” saying in</p>
<p>8:12. It should be understood as denoting God, whose name is “I am who I </p>
<p>am” (Exod 3:13–14) and who communicates himself as light (cf. Gen 1:3–8; </p>
<p>Ps 27:1; 36:9; etc.), not only of Judeans but of the whole world. Jesus’ self-</p>
<p>manifestation as the Light of the world is made here relevant to the feast </p>
<p>of Tabernacles. On the rst day of the feast four large lampstands were lit </p>
<p>up in the court of women and the young priests held in their hands the </p>
<p>candlesticks alight. e lights were so bright that the court was visible to </p>
<p>the whole city of Jerusalem (m. Sukkah 5:2–4). However, on the last day </p>
