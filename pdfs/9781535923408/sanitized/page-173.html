<p>John 14:1–14</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>death and resurrection to oer eternal redemption (Heb 9:12, 24). “Many </p>
<p>dwelling places” has an inclusive sense of accommodating all members of </p>
<p>Jesus’ community.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>ere is no trace in John that Jesus told them earlier that he was going </p>
<p>to prepare a place for them. Perhaps it is a traditional saying known to his </p>
<p>readers but not included in the narrative.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Probably Jesus said this when</p>
<p>he spoke of his leaving the world (13:33, 36). Jesus is going to the Father’s </p>
<p>house to prepare a place for all his disciples. is is repeated in 14:3 with </p>
<p>the promise that he will come again. ere is no indication of the time of </p>
<p>his second coming, but the purpose of his coming is to take the disciples to </p>
<p>himself so that where he is they also may be (cf. 17:24). “Taking to myself” </p>
<p>implies “taking up his followers along with him.” “To be with Jesus where </p>
<p>he is” is an eschatological expression that assures them that they will re-</p>
<p>main with Jesus forever (cf. 1 ess 4:16–17). Living in the Father’s house </p>
<p>in 14:2–3 has a family connotation: they will live as children of God. e </p>
<p>people of God’s community relate with one another as members of one </p>
<p>family. </p>
<p>Jesus reminds his disciples that during their association with him they </p>
<p>know the way to the Father’s house (14:4). However, John uses his literary </p>
<p>device of non-understanding. omas asks, “How can we know the way?” </p>
<p>(14:5), and confesses their ignorance of the place where Jesus is going to </p>
<p>and the way to it. Jesus removes their non-understanding by arming, </p>
<p>“I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, except </p>
<p>through me” (14:6). is explains where Jesus is going to and the way there, </p>
<p>and indicates that there is a possibility for any person to go to the Father in </p>
<p>heaven by following Jesus alone. </p>
<p>Jesus has already taught that he is the way to heaven from the earth </p>
<p>(1:51). In 14:6 he adds two more characteristics, “the truth” and “the life.” </p>
<p>Ps 86:11 links the Lord’s way with truth and Ps 119:30 refers to the way </p>
<p>of faithfulness. Prov 15:24 and Jer 21:8 speak of the way of life. For Qum-</p>
<p>ran community the study of the Law and its lifestyle is “the way” (1QS </p>
<p>8.14–15; 9.17–18; 10.21; CD-A 1.13).</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>e closer parallel, however, is in</p>
<p>Isa 30:20–21, where a word calling, “is is the way, walk in it,” is that of </p>
<p>the Teacher who is now revealed. John depicts Jesus, the way personied, </p>
