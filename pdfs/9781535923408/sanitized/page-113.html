was (John 7:42; cf. Mic 5:2). us, there was a division among people over
<p>the identity of Jesus (7:43). Some, probably the unbelieving Jews and the </p>
<p>temple ocers, wished to arrest Jesus, but no one laid hands on him (7:44; </p>
<p>cf. 7:30).</p>
<p>e chief priests and the Pharisees were waiting for the temple police </p>
<p>to seize Jesus and bring him back to them. But, to their disappointment, the </p>
<p>police returned without Jesus. e leaders questioned them indignantly, </p>
<p>“Why did you not bring him?” (7:45). e temple employees, who had ex-</p>
<p>perienced the drawing power of Jesus’ words, said, “No one ever spoke like </p>
<p>this man” (7:46). Jesus’ teaching was so convincing that they could not do </p>
<p>any harm to him. For the religious authorities any one who follows Jesus or </p>
<p>even sympathizes with him has gone astray from the Law. erefore they </p>
<p>asked the ocers, “And you have not gone astray, have you?” (7:47). is </p>
<p>reects the popular accusation that Jesus and, aer him, late rst-century </p>
<p>Christians were leading people astray (cf. 7:12). </p>
<p>e authorities further questioned them, “Did any of the authorities </p>
<p>or of the Pharisees believe in him?,” expecting the answer “no” (7:48). en </p>
<p>they admonished the ocials to follow the examples of their leaders rather </p>
<p>than troublesome preachers like Jesus. e leaders’ question betrays their </p>
<p>own ignorance, for they were unaware that Nicodemus, one among them, </p>
<p>had already been taught by Jesus with the result that he almost believed in </p>
<p>him and that many of the authorities themselves secretly believed in Jesus </p>
<p>(12:42). eir anger now turns against the crowd that believed Jesus as the </p>
<p>Christ. ey pronounce a curse on those who ignorantly disobey the Law </p>
<p>(cf. Deut 27:26; 28:15; Ps 119:21) by accepting someone who breaks the </p>
<p>Sabbath law (7:49).</p>
<p>e people accursed are not “the people of the land,” the mixed pagan-</p>
<p>Jewish population, who were thought of being ignorant of the Law. e </p>
<p>accursed are rather the Jewish pilgrims who had come to Jerusalem for </p>
<p>the feast, some of whom had proper understanding of Jesus. e Pharisees </p>
<p>regarded them equal to “the people of the land.” John ironically says that </p>
<p>those who were judged as scripturally illiterate understood Jesus correctly </p>
<p>as the Messiah.</p>

<p>Nicodemus is introduced here again aer the narrator le him abruptly </p>
<p>in John 3 as the one who had gone to Jesus before and as one of the authori-</p>
