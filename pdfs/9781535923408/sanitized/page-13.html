<p>Preface</p>
<p>Volumes have been written on various themes, including ecclesiology, in </p>
<p>John’s Gospel. However, some advanced works on the formation, empow-</p>
<p>erment, and development of the church, God’s new community or the new </p>
<p>covenant community, in John are called for in view of the growing threat </p>
<p>and persecution to churches today. is would be possible if we study </p>
<p>the Gospel with an analytical approach by way of exegesis. is is what I </p>
<p>have attempted to do in this commentary, written for the New Covenant </p>
<p>Commentary Series. I have argued that the church, God’s new community </p>
<p>that consists of those who believe in Jesus as the Christ, was founded and </p>
<p>expanded by Jesus globally through the working of the Holy Spirit. I have </p>
<p>also detected that the progressing new community has its root at the cross </p>
<p>of Christ and is empowered by the Holy Spirit to continue Jesus’ mission </p>
<p>in the world. I develop these ideas by emphasizing the believers’ covenant </p>
<p>relationship with God in Jesus and by allowing the text to speak for itself </p>
<p>through a community to the present community, both social and eccle-</p>
<p>siastical. e terms such as “God’s new community,” “Jesus’ community,” </p>
<p>“the new covenant community,” “the believing community,” “community of </p>
<p>faith,” and “the church” point to the same group.</p>
<p>I have given my own translation in English, wherever necessary, based </p>
<p>on the 28th edition of Nestle-Aland’s Greek text. “e Jews” (in quotation </p>
<p>marks) denotes the Jewish leaders or those who reject Jesus because of their </p>
<p>unbelief. Otherwise it denotes the Judeans or the Jews in general, whether </p>
<p>in dispersion or in Palestine. In this study, though brief, the readers, I be-</p>
<p>lieve, will not miss the kernel of John’s Gospel in its “new covenant commu-</p>
<p>nity” perspective. e given outline of the Gospel is based on the proposals </p>
<p>of Brown (2010), Lincoln (2006), and Michaels (2010). </p>
<p>I am indeed thankful to Profs. Craig Keener and Michael Bird for </p>
<p>entrusting me with the responsibility of writing a commentary on John </p>
<p>for the New Covenant Commentary Series and for their useful comments </p>
<p>and suggestions to improve all the chapters for better reading. My sincere </p>
<p>thanks are due to my doctoral mentor, Prof. James D. G. Dunn, to whom </p>
<p>this volume is warmly dedicated, for having given me access to some of his </p>
