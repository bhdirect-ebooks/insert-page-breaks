<p>Unbelief and Judgment</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>come to judge but to save human beings (12:47–48; 3:17). Jesus’ words are </p>
<p>collectively personied as a judge (12:48), because he did not speak any-</p>
<p>thing on his own initiative or authority (cf. 5:19; 8:26, 28), but the Father </p>
<p>who sent him has himself given the commandment of what to say and what </p>
<p>to speak (12:49). e phrases “what to say” and “what to speak” emphasize </p>
the divine necessity for Jesus to speak words given only by God. ough he
<p>is one with the Father, within that equality the Son is subordinate,</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>without</p>
<p>which their oneness would be impossible.</p>
<p>Jesus discloses that God’s commandment, the object of obedience, is </p>
<p>eternal life (12:50a; cf. 6:68), for obedience to God’s commandment leads </p>
<p>one to inherit the life of the age to come now and at the end-time (cf. </p>
<p>5:24–25). erefore as the Father has told him, so does Jesus speak what </p>
<p>he speaks (12:50b).</p>
<p>Fusing the Horizons </p>
<p>There is a need for believers to fall down and die so that they may yield much </p>
<p>fruit. Jesus explains that we should lose our lives in order to keep it for eternal </p>
<p>life. This means, in the light of the Synoptic parallels, that we are called to </p>
<p>carry the cross and follow him. The people of God’s community are to carry </p>
<p>in their bodies the death of Jesus always so that the life of Jesus may be </p>
<p>manifested from within them (2 Cor 4:10–12; cf. Rom 6:1–14). We must go </p>
<p>through spiritually what Jesus went through physically: we need to die to our </p>
<p>own intentions and purposes and gain a new perspective on life.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>The church</p>
<p>today is not aware of the need to die to itself and receive new life to serve </p>
<p>the world effectively. This is the cost to be paid by any one who would follow </p>
<p>Jesus.</p>
<p>Several years ago, I heard a Christian leader speaking of two pieces of </p>
<p>wheat grain, one put inside the showcase and another sown on the ground. </p>
<p>The grain placed inside the glass looked good and beautiful, but it was without </p>
<p>growth, whereas the other grain that was sown went into the ground and died </p>
<p>before it yielded fruit. Similarly, he said, the members of God’s community </p>
<p>should either remain showy or die and yield fruit. From that time on, I commit-</p>
<p>ted myself to fall and die in order to lead a life that will be useful for others.</p>
