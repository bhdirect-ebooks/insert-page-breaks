<p>Holistic Healing Given to a Sick</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>invalids such as the blind, lame, and paralyzed used to lie (5:3), because </p>
<p>people believed that the water in the double pool had healing power.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Some ancient authorities insert verse 4 aer 5:3 to read: “. . . waiting </p>
<p>for the moving of the water, </p>
<p>4 </p>
<p>for an angel went down at a certain season </p>
<p>into the pool, and troubled the water; whosoever then rst aer the trou-</p>
<p>bling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he </p>
<p>had.” is addition reects a popular belief at that time and the scribes </p>
<p>inserted it to explain 5:7.</p>
<p>ere was a man who had been ill for thirty-eight years without hav-</p>
<p>ing anyone to put him rst into the pool before another sick person stepped </p>
<p>down into the water ahead of him when it was stirred (5:5, 7). It implies that </p>
<p>he was a paralytic or lame and was unable to walk or run. Jesus, who visited </p>
<p>the pool on the Sabbath, supernaturally knew that this particular man had </p>
<p>been lying there for a long time. He went to the man and asked him, “Do </p>
<p>you want to become well?” (5:6b). Jesus’ question shows that he does not </p>
<p>do anything against human will. Probably the man got the idea that Jesus </p>
<p>would heal him. erefore he unreservedly told Jesus that there is no one </p>
<p>to put him in the pool when the water is troubled and that while he is going </p>
<p>another invalid person steps down into it before him. On hearing this Jesus </p>
<p>told him, “Rise, take up your pallet and walk” (5:8). Immediately the man </p>
<p>became well. He took up his pallet and walked (5:9). is incident reveals </p>
<p>that Jesus can change any circumstances for human welfare. John deliber-</p>
<p>ately mentions that that day was the Sabbath (5:9b; cf. 9:14). </p>
<p>His purpose in healing the man on the Sabbath is twofold: rst, to </p>
<p>fulll the meaning of Sabbath law as to bring freedom to those who are in </p>
<p>physical and social bondage (cf. Deut 5:15); second, by foreknowing the </p>
<p>conict that will arise with the Jewish authorities, Jesus wished to prove his </p>
<p>oneness with the Father in work and to initiate the process of going to the </p>
<p>cross. Aer his healing, “the Jews” raised their objection and persecuted Je-</p>
<p>sus for having worked on the Sabbath (5:16). ey even planned to kill him </p>
<p>(5:18). is would enable the Son to accomplish God’s redemptive purpose </p>
<p>to which the Law points.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>“e Jews,” instead of rejoicing over the man who was healed, showed </p>
<p>resentment, by quoting the Law, which does not permit anyone to take up </p>
<p>the pallet on the Sabbath (5:10). e OT warns that working on the Sabbath </p>
<p>5. At the time of Hadrian (early second century CE), the location of the pools was </p>
<p>considered a healing sanctuary dedicated to Asclepius or Serapis; Lincoln 2006: 193.</p>
<p>6. For Jesus’ reinterpretation of Sabbath ethics, see Kanagaraj 2001: 33–60.</p>
