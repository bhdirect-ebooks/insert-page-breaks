<p>John 6:1–15</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>(6:3), depicting the Jewish custom of pupils sitting around their teacher for </p>
<p>learning.</p>
<p>A crowd of Galilean peasants and shermen who had seen Jesus heal-</p>
<p>ing the sick followed him and reached the place where they were sitting </p>
<p>(6:2). “e Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand” (6:4) means that </p>
<p>the Jewish Passover had almost arrived. Usually Jesus went up to Jerusalem </p>
<p>at Passover (2:13; 12:1, 12; 13:1). However, in this year Jesus seems to have </p>
<p>remained in Galilee. </p>
<p>“Liing up his eyes” (6:5a) is a Jewish gesture of prayer (11:41; 17:1). </p>
<p>Here it marks Jesus’ compassion for the needy (cf. Mark 6:34). His “see-</p>
<p>ing” of a multitude coming to him implies both his physical sight and his </p>
<p>deeper perception of their need for food. Before the crowd reached him, </p>
<p>Jesus foreknew how miraculously he would feed them (6:6b)! at is why </p>
<p>he asked Philip, to test him, “From where shall we buy bread so that they </p>
<p>may eat?” (6:5b). While in the Synoptic Gospels the disciples bring to Jesus </p>
<p>the need for food (Matt 14:15 par.), in John Jesus takes the initiative to give </p>
<p>food. Jesus’ testing of Philip reects a teacher who would test his pupils to </p>
<p>deepen their understanding of truth. Philip was astonished by Jesus’ ques-</p>
<p>tion, because they did not have enough money to feed the multitude. In his </p>
<p>estimate, the total cost would be more than two hundred denarii (i.e., two </p>
<p>hundred days’ wages for a laborer) to give even a little amount of food to </p>
<p>each person (6:7). In the process of feeding, Jesus showed his disciples that </p>
<p>they are partners in his mission.</p>
<p>Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, found out a little boy who had ve </p>
<p>barley loaves and two sh</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>and introduced him to Jesus, raising doubt,</p>
<p>however, over its suciency to feed such a large crowd (6:8–9). A “barley </p>
<p>loaf” was a cheap bread used by poorer classes (Spec. 3.57). It has an al-</p>
<p>lusion to Elisha’s miracle of feeding a hundred men with barley loaves (2 </p>
<p>Kgs 4:42–44). e Jews expected that miracles like those of Elisha would </p>
<p>happen in the messianic time.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>If so, John’s deliberate use of “barley loaves”</p>
<p>indicates that the messianic time had dawned in Jesus. </p>
<p>Responding to Andrew’s doubt, Jesus instructed the disciples to make </p>
<p>the crowd sit down and they did so (John 6:10; cf. 2:7). John species that </p>
<p>there was “much grass” (cf. Matt 14:19; Mark 6:39), implying that the feed-</p>
<p>ing took place during the spring. He also species the number of men who </p>
<p>4. e used Greek word opsarion means “preserved sh” (BDAG, 746), especially </p>
<p>“pickled sh” (Barrett 1978: 275).</p>
