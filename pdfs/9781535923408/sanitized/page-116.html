<p>Reversal of the Law’s Condemnation</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>e pair “the scribes and the Pharisees,” which appears in the Synoptic </p>
<p>Gospels, is strange in 8:3. Moreover, throughout his Gospel, John places </p>
<p>the Pharisees functionally in a higher rank of authority to the extent that </p>
<p>people feared them (1:19, 24; 4:1; 7:13, 32, 45–52; 9:22; 12:42), but in 8:3 </p>
<p>they do the work of temple police! ey placed the woman in the midst of </p>
<p>the crowd and accused her before Jesus of adultery, which, as per Moses’ </p>
<p>Law, deserves death by stoning (8:5). ey did not bring the adulterous </p>
<p>man as an accused. is shows their bias mind and disobedience to the Law </p>
<p>(cf. Lev 20:10–12, 14; 21:9; Deut 22:2–24).</p>
<p>eir question “What, then, do you say of her?” (8:5) was to test Jesus. </p>
<p>ey could bring a charge against him that he was not observing the Law if </p>
<p>he acquitted her (8:6a), and if he instructed them to put her to death they </p>
<p>could accuse him of infringing on the authority of the Roman governor, </p>
<p>who was the only one normally to issue a death sentence. e scribes and </p>
<p>the Pharisees thus attempted to bring religious and political charge against </p>
<p>Jesus and put him to death.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Even Jesus’ opponents, who were teachers of</p>
<p>the Law, unknowingly accepted him as the judge whose judgment is just </p>
<p>(5:30) and as a “teacher” (8:4).</p>
<p>Jesus’ response to them was puzzling. He simply bent down and wrote </p>
<p>with his nger on the ground (8:6b), and John narrates that he did the same </p>
<p>again (8:8). is is the only reference in the whole of NT to Jesus writing. </p>
<p>What and why did he write? Four interpretations are proposed.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>the solution for such questions probably lies in the phrase “with his nger.” </p>
<p>In the Synoptic Gospels, the nger of Jesus is identied with the power of </p>
<p>the Holy Spirit by which he casts out demons (Luke 11:26; cf. Matt 12:28; </p>
<p>Mark 3:22–30). e OT describes God’s nger as having written the Ten </p>
<p>Commandments (Exod 31:18; 32:16; Deut 9:10) and as having performed </p>
<p>miraculous power (Deut 8:19).</p>
<p>e more relevant image that may underlie Jesus’ writing with his n-</p>
<p>ger is Dan 5:5–9, 24–28, where the ngers of a human hand appeared and </p>
<p>wrote on the wall disclosing God’s displeasure over the acts of the Babylo-</p>
<p>nian king, Belshazzar, and the impending judgment on him. In 8:6, 8 the </p>
<p>same God acts by writing on the ground with the nger of human hand to </p>
<p>convict the accusers of their own sins and of the resultant judgment of God </p>
<p>that has already fallen on them. Jesus’ opponents would not have under-</p>
<p>stood the words written on the ground, but they were powerful enough to </p>
