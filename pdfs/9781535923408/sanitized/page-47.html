<p>John 1:35–51</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>“Son of Man” is spoken by the people on par with “Messiah” (12:34). us, </p>
<p>the “Son of Man” in 1:51 refers to Christ, who came from heaven to reveal </p>
<p>God, his love and life-giving power. He is the place where one can see God’s </p>
<p>glory in human form on earth (John 19:5; cf. Ezek 1:26–28). is could be a </p>
<p>polemic against the Jewish mystics who claimed that one can see the kingly </p>
<p>glory of God in human form only by ascending to heaven (cf. John 3:13).</p>
<p>e whole Gospel of John hereaer will show how Jesus’ promise in </p>
<p>1:51 was fullled in the life and ministry of Jesus and how God was creat-</p>
<p>ing a new covenant community in the Son of Man. In this sense, 1:51 is a </p>
<p>springboard for studying the Gospel of John.</p>
