<p>themselves under the death sentence pronounced by God.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>However, by</p>
<p>using the expression “truly, truly, I say to you,” Jesus says that any one who </p>
<p>accepts his word of salvation will never experience death (8:51). “e Jews” </p>
<p>reiterate now that Jesus has a demon and ask how, if Abraham and other </p>
<p>OT prophets have already died, Jesus can say that any one who obeys his </p>
<p>word will never taste death. “Seeing death” (8:51) means “tasting death” </p>
<p>(8:52).</p>
<p>ey ask him, “Are you greater than our father Abraham?” (8:53; cf. </p>
<p>4:12). ey see Jesus as no more than a human and not worthy to be com-</p>
<p>pared with such esteemed patriarchs as Abraham and the prophets, who </p>
all died. eir question “Who do you make yourself to be?” divulges their
<p>thought that Jesus is making himself equal to God, who alone can protect a </p>
<p>person from death (Deut 32:39; 1 Sam 2:6; 2 Kgs 5:7). Jesus repeatedly says </p>
<p>that if he gloried himself it would have no value, but that it is his Father </p>
<p>who glories him (8:54; cf. 8:50; 13:31–34).</p>
<p>“e Jews” boastfully claim Yahweh, Jesus’ Father, as their God, but </p>
<p>without an intimate relationship with him (cf. 1:10; 7:28; 8:19). But Jesus </p>
<p>arms twice that he knows the Father in the sense that he obeys God’s </p>
<p>word (8:55; cf. 10:15). Jesus cannot hide his intimacy with God, lest he be-</p>
<p>comes a liar like his opponents, who falsely claim that Jesus’ Father is their </p>
<p>God (8:54–55). “Your father Abraham” (8:56) indicates that “the Jews” are </p>
<p>the physical descendants of Abraham. But they do not share Abraham’s at-</p>
<p>titude towards Jesus. Abraham rejoiced when God revealed himself to him </p>
<p>with a promise to give him a son (Gen 17:17; cf. Jub. 14:21; 15:17; 16:19). </p>
<p>Similar promises given to Abraham (Gen 12:1–4, 7; 15:4–6; 17:6–8) have </p>
<p>come to complete fulllment with the coming of Christ in the esh (Gal </p>
<p>3:16) and Abraham lived in joyful hope of seeing the day of the Messiah, </p>
<p>for the gospel was preached beforehand to Abraham (Gal 3:8). He saw that </p>
<p>day, by faith, in his lifetime, just as Isaiah saw Christ’s glory (12:41). Aer </p>
<p>his death, he watched Jesus’ life and ministry from heaven and rejoiced to </p>
<p>see it clearly (John 8:56; cf. Heb 11:13).</p>
<p>Jesus’ opponents, with earthly understanding, contemptuously ques-</p>
<p>tion him, “You have not (attained) yet y years and have you seen Abra-</p>
<p>ham?” (8:57). eir question provides Jesus an occasion to claim for himself </p>
<p>the absolute “I am” (cf. 8:24, 28) as the climax of the dialogue. By means </p>
<p>of the phrase “truly, truly, I say to you,” Jesus arms the heavenly truth, </p>
“Before Abraham came into being, I am” (8:58). e divine name “I am”
