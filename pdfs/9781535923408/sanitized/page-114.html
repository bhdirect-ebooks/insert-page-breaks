<p>e Authorities’ Rejection of Jesus’ Proclamation</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>Nicodemus as one of the Pharisees who rejected Jesus. His claim “our law” </p>
<p>(7:51) does not show him as identifying himself with the unbelieving Phar-</p>
<p>isees, but generally with Jewish people. Nicodemus indirectly defends Jesus </p>
<p>by means of the Law. us, he calls into question the Pharisees’ knowledge </p>
<p>of the Law</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>by asking, “Does our law judge the man unless rst one hears</p>
<p>from him and knows what he does?” (7:51). Actually the Law does not </p>
<p>allow judges to judge a man without hearing him and inquiring diligently </p>
<p>into the case (Deut 1:16–17; 17:4; 19:18). Nicodemus not only demands for </p>
<p>a fair trial, but also accuses the authorities, who exhibit a prejudgmental </p>
<p>attitude towards others without following the Law.</p>
<p>Nicodemus exhorts his colleagues to hear rst Jesus’ words and learn </p>
<p>the signicance of his works, aer which they may judge him fairly. Nico-</p>
<p>demus’ saying gives the authorities the impression that he believes Jesus </p>
<p>as the end-time prophet, the Messiah, whose words and deeds should be </p>
<p>properly understood. erefore they respond, “You are not from Galilee, </p>
<p>are you? Search and see that a prophet does not arise from Galilee” (7:52).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> </p>
<p>eir words show that Nicodemus spoke in favor of Jesus. is, in turn, </p>
<p>proves that what Jesus spoke to Nicodemus earlier (3:1–21) must have con-</p>
<p>vinced him that Jesus represents the rule of God and that by believing in </p>
<p>him as the Christ, the Son of God, one can receive eternal life.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>e chief priests and the Pharisees were wrong in saying that no </p>
<p>prophet will arise from Galilee. ey were unaware that prophets such as </p>
<p>Jonah (2 Kgs 14:25), possibly Elijah (1 Kgs 17:1), and Nahum (Nah 1:1) </p>
<p>came from Galilee.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>ey were ignorant of the rabbinic tradition that says,</p>
<p>“R. Eliezer (ca. 90 CE) said: ou hast no single tribe in Israel from which </p>
<p>a prophet has not come forth” (b. Sukkah 27b).</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Above all, they forgot that</p>
<p>Jesus was not from Galilee, but from Bethlehem in Judea (Mic 5:2; cf. 7:42). </p>
<p>e religious leaders, who should have learnt this by searching the scrip-</p>
<p>tures, show their own blindness as they ignore Nicodemus’ appeal to the </p>
<p>Law and seek to kill Jesus.</p>

<p>16. e early manuscripts P</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> and P</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>read “the prophet” and this may be the original</p>
<p>reading in 7:52; Brown 1978: 1.325; Blomberg 2001: 139.</p>

<p>lean prophets.</p>
