<p>Jesus’ Oneness with and Submission to the Father</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>Jesus is going to the Father who sent him (cf. 7:33; 8:14, 16b). Jesus rebukes </p>
<p>“the Jews,” “You will seek me, and you will die in your sin” (8:21). “Sin” </p>
in John indicates not so much individual actions as unbelief (3:18; 16:9).
<p>Seeking Jesus without faith eventually brings eternal death instead of heav-</p>
<p>enly life with God, both now and in future (8:24; 3:16; 5:24). As unbeliev-</p>
<p>ers, where Jesus goes they cannot come. When they heard it, they ridiculed </p>
<p>him saying, “Will he kill himself, because he says, ‘Where I am going, you </p>
<p>cannot come’?” (8:22; cf. 7:35–36). ere is an irony that when Jesus warns </p>
<p>them that they will die due to their sin, “the Jews” ignore this warning and </p>
<p>speak of Jesus killing himself. Committing suicide belongs to the earthly </p>
<p>realm and self-murder is an instance of crime against God our Creator </p>
<p>(J.W. 3.8.5). erefore Jesus responds in dualistic terms that his opponents </p>
<p>are from “below,” whereas he is from “above” from the Father (8:23). </p>
<p>To be from below is to be attached with this world, which is unspiri-</p>
<p>tual, devilish, and full of selsh ambition and evil practices (Jas 3:15–16). </p>
<p>ose who are from below, therefore, live in alienation from God (John </p>
1:10; 7:7; 14:17, 27; 15:18–19), and they cannot understand divine things. In
<p>contrast, to be “from above” denotes to being “from God who is in heaven” </p>
<p>(3:3). Jesus comes from above (cf. 6:46; 8:42) and therefore he does not bear </p>
<p>the nature of this world. “e Jews,” being from this earth, live for earthly </p>
<p>things and they cannot believe that Jesus is the “I am” who has delivered </p>
<p>people from bondage. ose who do not believe cannot be delivered from </p>
<p>sin but will die in it (8:24).</p>
<p>e closest parallel to the “I am” statement in 8:24 is in Isa 43. In his </p>
<p>lawsuit against the world, Yahweh declares that he has chosen his people so </p>
<p>that they may know, and believe . . . that “I am [he]” (Isa 43:10 LXX) and </p>
<p>promises, “I, even I, am he that blots out . . . your sins” (43:25 LXX). is </p>
<p>means that if they do not believe in Yahweh that he is “I am,” their sins will </p>
<p>not be blotted out and they will perish in their sins.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>By picking up this</p>
<p>image, Jesus reveals himself as God in his name “I am” and fullls God’s </p>
<p>role of forgiving people of their sins lest they die in them. “e Jews” will </p>
<p>not seek Jesus as long as he is on earth. ey may seek him for salvation, </p>
<p>aer he goes away to the Father, but their delayed search will cause them to </p>
<p>die in their sin (8:21).</p>
<p>Although Jesus’ opponents know that “I am” is the name of God, </p>
<p>which Jesus used for himself, they are unable to comprehend the nature of </p>
<p>his claim and hence ask him, “You, who are you?” (8:25a). Jesus seems to </p>
<p>14. Cf. Ball 1996: 188–94.</p>
