<p>John 6:1–15</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>John combines in 6:14–15 both the “one who is coming” (the Mes-</p>
<p>siah) and “king” (cf. 1:45, 49; 12:13, 15). e crowd confessed Jesus to be </p>
<p>the prophet who is coming into the world and wanted to make him king, </p>
<p>a political gure, without knowing that he is already the messianic King. </p>
<p>He knew that in their excitement of having eaten their ll, people sought </p>
<p>to seize and make him king (6:15). Since his kingship is not of this world </p>
<p>(18:36), he withdrew himself to go back to the mountain by himself, prob-</p>
<p>ably to pray (Matt 14:23; Mark 6:46). us, the messianic secret is displayed </p>
<p>in John dierently from Mark (see comments on 1:41–45; 7:3-9; 10:24–25).</p>
<p>Jesus walking on the sea (6:16–21) </p>
<p>John records the h sign in 6:16–21, in which Jesus reveals God’s glory </p>
<p>in terms of his power to save his disciples from danger by exercising his </p>
<p>unique authority over nature. is is the only sign in John that Jesus per-</p>
<p>formed exclusively for the twelve disciples. John seems to follow here a </p>
<p>tradition independent of his knowledge of the Synoptic accounts.</p>
<p>Aer Jesus went to the mountain, the disciples might have been wait-</p>
<p>ing for him until evening, as the comment “Jesus had not yet come to them” </p>
<p>(6:17) shows. In the evening they decided to row back on the Sea to Caper-</p>
<p>naum without Jesus (6:16–17; cf. Matt 14:23; Mark 6:47). Josephus gives </p>
<p>the breadth of the Sea of Gennesaret as 40 furlongs and its length as 140 </p>
<p>(J.W. 3.10.7). Although the average breadth was about ve miles, from the </p>
<p>mountainside south of Bethdaida they might have had to row at least one </p>
<p>mile longer. As they were rowing towards Capernaum via Bethsaida, the </p>
<p>sun set and it became dark. e Sea of Galilee was oen subject to strong </p>
<p>winds blowing east, which caused waves to rise up, making it tough to row </p>
<p>west (6:18).</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>ey had rowed about three or four miles (6:19a), almost to</p>
<p>the middle of the sea, where human help was impossible.</p>
<p>Being surrounded by darkness (a temporal reference without sym-</p>
<p>bolic meaning), the disciples became desperate. In this situation, they saw </p>
<p>Jesus “walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat” (6:19b). By trans-</p>
<p>lating the Greek phrase epi tēs thalassēs as “by the sea,” Weiss argues that </p>
<p>the disciples actually saw Jesus walking along the shore rather than on the </p>
<p>sea and that due to darkness they mistook themselves to be in the middle </p>
<p>of the sea, while actually they were nearly at the other side.</p>
