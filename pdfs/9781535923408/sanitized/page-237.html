<p>John 21:1–14</p>
<p>209</p>
<p>(21:14; cf. 20:19–23, 26–29). e purpose of this revelation by means of </p>
<p>three dimensions of a sign (the miraculous catch of 153 sh, the unbroken </p>
<p>net, and the meal kept ready by the risen Jesus) is not merely to reveal Jesus, </p>
<p>but also to promote the virtues of love, unity and servanthood within his </p>
<p>community. </p>
<p>Final reference to Peter and the beloved disciple </p>
<p>(21:15–23) </p>
<p>Prediction on Peter’s ministry and destiny (21:15–19) </p>
<p>Aer breakfast, Jesus turns his attention to Simon Peter and asks him, “Si-</p>
<p>mon, son of John, do you love me more than these?” (21:15a; cf. 1:42). e </p>
verb “to love” indicates divine love. “More than these” may be understood
<p>either as more than the boat, net, sh, etc., or as more than Peter loves </p>
<p>the other disciples, or as more than the other disciples love Jesus. Love for </p>
<p>Jesus cannot be compared with one’s love for material things. Love for Je-</p>
<p>sus and love for his followers go together (cf. 1 John 5:1–2) and cannot </p>
<p>be compared. Jesus’ question may rightly be understood as, “Do you love </p>
<p>me more than these other disciples do?” Peter once claimed that he, more </p>
<p>than others, would even lay down his life for Jesus (13:37; cf. Matt 26:33; </p>
<p>Mark 14:29). But instead of expressing his love, he had denied his Master </p>
<p>rmly. Now Jesus deals with his boasting by seeking an assurance from him </p>
<p>whether or not he loves Jesus more than other disciples do. By claiming his </p>
<p>long association with Jesus, Peter answers in armative, saying, “Yes, Lord; </p>
<p>you know that I love you.”</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Soon aer his assurance, Jesus gives him the</p>
<p>charge, “Feed my lambs” (21:15b).</p>
<p>Jesus asks him the same question a second time, but without “more </p>
<p>than these.” Peter answers in the armative. Jesus gives him the same </p>
<p>charge, saying, “Shepherd my sheep” (21:16). “Feeding” and “shepherding” </p>
<p>imply the two aspects of pastoral ministry: “feeding” means nourishing </p>
<p>Jesus’ community with the spiritual food, and “shepherding” emphasizes </p>
<p>governing the congregation for its overall growth.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> us, Jesus commis-</p>
<p>sions Peter to give pastoral care for the total growth of his people. In spite </p>
<p>of Peter’s double armation of his love for Jesus, surprisingly Jesus asks the </p>
<p>12. Both philein (“to love”), used by Peter and later by Jesus (21:17), and agapan (“to </p>
<p>love”), used by Jesus (21:15–16), bear the same sense in this context.</p>
