<p>John’s Purpose as Conclusion</p>
<p>204</p>
<p>However, John’s purpose should be understood in the light of the </p>
<p>whole Gospel and in its historical context rather than on the basis of one </p>
<p>Greek word used at the end. His overall concern is to bring all human </p>
<p>beings to faith and for that purpose Jesus sends his disciples, whom he </p>
<p>trained, to bear witness to him in the world. John’s primary concern is to </p>
<p>lead all humans to accept that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of God, the </p>
<p>one who is equal to God and the revelation of God. ose who believe will </p>
enjoy divine life, in lieu of eternal condemnation, in the authoritative name
<p>of Jesus. It is the believing community, the church, that will bear witness to </p>
<p>these. Jesus prepared and empowered this community by the Holy Spirit </p>
<p>so that his mission may be accomplished through it. us, John’s Gospel </p>
<p>is meant both for the unbelieving world and for the believing commu-</p>
<p>nity. John, then, concludes his Gospel at the peak of his Christology and </p>
<p>ecclesiology.</p>
