<p>JOHN 9</p>
<p>The Holistic Healing of a Man Born Blind</p>
<p>e healing of a blind man takes place soon aer the feast of Tabernacles, </p>
<p>marking the messianic day when there will be recovery of sight for the blind </p>
<p>(Isa 61:1). John’s presentation of this sixth sign contains eight scenes (9:1–5, </p>
<p>6–7, 8–12, 13–17, 18–23, 24–34, 35–39, 40–41).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>A study of John 9 in three</p>
<p>parts will reveal to us how a man born blind received holistic healing from </p>
<p>Jesus and how, in the process, he came to perceive Jesus as the Son of Man </p>
<p>who is to be worshipped.</p>
<p>Recovery of sight for a blind man (9:1–12) </p>
<p>Aer Jesus le the temple, he saw a man born blind begging (9:1, 8). Jewish </p>
<p>society believed that sickness and suerings oen come because of the sins </p>
of the individuals (2 Kgs 14:6; Mark 2:5; John 5:14) or because of the sins of
<p>the parents (Exod 20:5; Deut 5:9). erefore, the disciples ask Jesus whose </p>
<p>sin was the cause of the man being born blind (9:2). Jesus answers that </p>
<p>the man’s blindness is not due to his or his parents’ sins, but is due to the </p>
<p>manifestation of works of God in him (9:3). God sent Jesus into the world </p>
<p>to accomplish his work of deliverance (4:34; 5:17, 36; 17:4), which is to be </p>
<p>performed on the blind man so that God might reveal himself through his </p>
<p>healing of the man born blind.</p>
<p>Jesus’ injunction, “We must work the works of him who sent me” </p>
<p>(9:4), includes also his followers in doing God’s works. e plural “works” </p>
<p>denotes not only physical healing, but also spiritual insight. e work of </p>
<p>bringing holistic healing to the sick and suering is not optional, but is </p>
divine commandment, as the word “must [work]” shows. is divine work
<p>cannot be done on their own, but only with Jesus (15:5). It needs to be done </p>
<p>during the day when light is available. Jesus hints at his departure from the </p>
<p>world (7:33; 8:21), as he warns that night comes when no one can work in </p>
