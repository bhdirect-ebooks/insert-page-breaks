<p>Pastoral Prayer of Jesus</p>
<p>e Pastoral Speech of Jesus is appended in John 17 with his prayer for his </p>
<p>disciples and for the future believing community. David Chyträus (1531–</p>
<p>1600 CE) called this the “High-Priestly Prayer.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>e word “high-priestly”</p>
<p>is a Jewish term. It is also inappropriate to call the prayer the “Testament of </p>
<p>Jesus,”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>for it overlooks Jesus’ resurrection. It is more sensible in our times</p>
<p>to call it Jesus’ “Pastoral Prayer.”</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>e current location of the prayer is in</p>
<p>accordance with the Jewish custom of concluding a farewell speech with a </p>
<p>prayer.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Jesus’ prayer for his glorification (17:1–5) </p>
<p>e opening phrase, “aer Jesus spoke these,” concludes Jesus’ Pastoral </p>
<p>Speech and begins his prayer directed to the Father (11:41; 12:27; 17:5, </p>
<p>11, 21, 24–25), claiming the petitioner’s lial relationship with God. Jesus’ </p>
<p>gesture of liing his eyes up to heaven is the normal Jewish way of prayer </p>
<p>(Ps 121:1–2; 123:1–4; Dan 4:34; John 6:5; 11:41). Jesus realizes that the time </p>
<p>appointed by the Father for his crucixion has come (12:23; 13:1). is is </p>
<p>the event in which the Father will reveal the glory of his Son supremely. </p>
<p>e Son’s glory is the Father’s glory (1:14; 17:22) and thus his glorication </p>
<p>will bring honor to the Father (17:1; 13:31–32). is mutual glorication is </p>
<p>possible because God has given Jesus authority over all people (“all esh”) </p>
<p>to give the life of the age to come (“eternal life”) to all whom God has given </p>
<p>him (17:2; cf. 5:21, 29).</p>
<p>Eternal life, for Jesus, is to know the only true God and Jesus Christ </p>
<p>whom God sent (17:3). He avoids the gnostic term “knowledge,” but uses </p>

<p>3. Michaels’ (2010: 857) point that this prayer can be viewed as the “Shepherd’s </p>
<p>prayer” that has both pastoral and priestly concerns ts into our view.</p>
