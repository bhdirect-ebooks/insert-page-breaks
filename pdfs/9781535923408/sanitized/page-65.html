<p>John 3:22–30</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>“bridegroom” refers to God who rejoices over his “bride,” the people of </p>
<p>Israel, by covenant relationship (Isa 62:5b; Jer 2:2; Ezek 16:8–14; Hos 2:16, </p>
<p>19–20). So also, those who go to Jesus are his bride (cf. Matt 25:1; Mark </p>
<p>2:19; 2 Cor 11:2; Eph 5:23–27, 31–32; Rev 21:2; 22:17).</p>
<p>When the bridegroom takes the bride by speaking to her and mak-</p>
<p>ing his vow, the best man rejoices,</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>or when the friend hears the shout of</p>
<p>exultation by the bridegroom when he discovers the bride a virgin in the </p>
<p>bridal chamber, he rejoices by hearing the joyful voice of the bridegroom. </p>
<p>e work of the best man is then complete.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Now the Baptist hears that</p>
<p>more people are following Jesus and are baptized. is marks the voice of </p>
<p>bridegroom’s joy. He, who is subordinate to Jesus, fully rejoices that his mis-</p>
<p>sion of testifying to Jesus as the Christ is complete. For the Baptist, Jesus </p>
<p>must increase but he must decrease (3:30), implying that Jesus should be </p>
<p>projected as the Christ, the Son of God, whereas he himself must become </p>
<p>less signicant. us, the Baptist takes away the rival spirit of his disciples </p>
<p>against Jesus.</p>
<p>Summary statements (3:31–36)</p>
<p>3:31–36 seems to be the continuation of the Baptist’s witness to Jesus. Some </p>
<p>nd a good transition from 3:30 to 3:31. Others argue that 3:31–36 contain </p>
<p>the sayings of Jesus and therefore that it should be placed aer 3:21. How-</p>
<p>ever, 3:31 does not give a relevant sequence to 3:21. Dodd regards 3:22–36 </p>
<p>as an explanatory appendix to 3:1–21.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Since 3:31–36 recapitulates the</p>
<p>words of Jesus and those of the Baptist (3:1–30), we may treat 3:31–36 as a </p>
<p>summary placed by the Evangelist or an editor</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>ttingly at the end of the</p>
<p>rst phase of Jesus’ ministry in Judea.</p>
<p>e greatness of Jesus is underlined again in 3:31–36. e close rela-</p>
<p>tionship between the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit in terms of their </p>
<p>corporate function is also visible. e phrase “he who comes from above” </p>
<p>indicates not only the heavenly origin of Jesus (3:31c; cf. 3:2), but also con-</p>
<p>trasts him with anyone who belongs to the earth. A dualism is presented </p>
<p>between the nature of the one who is from above and of the one who is of </p>
<p>earth (cf. 3:6; 8:23). Humans, who came out of dust, belong to this earth </p>
