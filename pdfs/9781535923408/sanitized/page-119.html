<p>esh. Jesus’ judgment is genuine, because it is not he who alone judges, but </p>
<p>he and the Father who sent him judge (8:16; cf. 5:22; 27–29). e phrase “I </p>
<p>and he [i.e., the Father] who sent me” betrays Semitism, denoting the soli-</p>
<p>darity between Israel and Yahweh (m. Sukkah 4:5).</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>In John, Jesus replaces</p>
<p>Israel in his solidarity with the Father,</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>because Israel failed to maintain its</p>
<p>relationship with Yahweh by her disobedience. By reminding them of the </p>
<p>requirement of the Law for at least two witnesses, Jesus reiterated that he </p>
<p>bears witness to himself, because the Father who sent him bears witness to </p>
<p>him (8:17–18; 5:31–32). e term “your law” means the Law the Pharisees </p>
<p>themselves accept. By using it, Jesus distanced himself from the unbeliev-</p>
<p>ing Jews (cf. 10:34; 15:25).</p>
<p>Jesus’ address of God as “the Father who sent me” triggered the sar-</p>
<p>castic question from his opponents, “Where is your Father?” (8:19), which </p>
<p>may mean, “Who is your Father?,” implying that Jesus does not have a le-</p>
<p>gitimate earthly father. eir question indicates that they were unable to </p>
<p>understand the oneness that exists between Jesus and their “one Father, </p>
<p>God” (8:41; cf. 5:18). erefore Jesus accused them that they did not know </p>
<p>him, who comes from the Father, and consequently they did not know their </p>
<p>own God, whom Jesus addressed as “my Father” (8:19). ey perhaps had </p>
<p>a theoretical knowledge of God of which they were proud (Deut 4:7; Rom </p>
<p>2:17),</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>but not an intimate relationship with him, as the term “knowing”</p>
<p>means.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Jesus confronted “the Jews” with these words in the treasury, near the </p>
<p>women’s court in the temple and the hall where the Sanhedrin met.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Jewish</p>
<p>ocials would have heard Jesus’ words spoken in this key place, but no one </p>
<p>arrested him, for his hour, determined by God, had not yet come (8:20).</p>
<p>Jesus’ oneness with and submission to the Father (8:21–30) </p>
<p>e word “again” (8:21) may either point to similar words already spoken </p>
<p>by Jesus (7:33–36) or to another layer of Jesus’ teaching. Jesus says “I go </p>
<p>away” without mentioning his destination, but the reader will know that </p>

<p>12. “Knowing God” is possible by seeing Jesus (12:45; 14:9) and believing in him </p>
