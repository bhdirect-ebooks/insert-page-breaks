<p>you” (11:22) shows her deeper faith that if Jesus prays to the Father who </p>
<p>sent him, Lazarus will be brought back to life. On seeing Martha’s faith, </p>
<p>Jesus promises that her brother will be raised (11:23).</p>
<p>Martha misunderstands Jesus’ promise as referring to Lazarus’ resur-</p>
<p>rection at the end-time (11:24; cf. 5:28–29; 6:40, 44, 54, 58). Jesus corrects </p>
<p>her by arming, “I am the resurrection and the life” (11:25a). is means </p>
<p>that in Jesus the eternally existing God reveals himself as the one who of-</p>
<p>fers to those who believe in Jesus the life of resurrection now and at the </p>
<p>end-time. e present possession of resurrection life in Jesus is known by </p>
<p>the use of present tenses “I am” and “the one who believes,” while its future </p>
<p>inheritance is envisaged in Jesus’ assurance, “Even if [those who believe </p>
<p>in me] die, they shall live” (11:25b). e present and future experiences of </p>
<p>resurrection life are intertwined in 11:26 (cf. 5:24–25). Every one who lives </p>
<p>and believes in Jesus now shall never experience death. With this clarica-</p>
<p>tion, Jesus asks Martha, “Do you believe this?” (11:26b). </p>
<p>Martha’s answer, “Yes, Lord, I have believed that you are the Christ, the </p>
<p>Son of God, who is coming into the world” (11:27), is highly charged with </p>
<p>christological meaning. e intensive perfect, “I have believed,” means, “I </p>
<p>have come to believe,” and indicates a settled conviction.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> Martha’s confes-</p>
<p>sion is the basic belief of God’s new community. e credit of confessing </p>
<p>Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God, goes to a woman in John, whereas in the </p>
<p>Synoptic Gospels it goes to a man, Simon Peter (Matt 16:16 par.). In John, </p>
<p>the title “Christ” is used synonymously with “the Holy One of God” (6:69), </p>
<p>“the one of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote” (1:41, 45), </p>
<p>the “Son of God” and “the King of Israel” (1:49). e additional confession </p>
<p>“He who is coming into the world” implies Jesus’ whole incarnate life in </p>
<p>the world (1:9). In the Synoptic Gospels it refers to the Messiah (Matt 11:3; </p>
<p>Luke 7:19). e title “the Son of God,” which is used in synonymous terms </p>
<p>with “Christ,” emphasizes Jesus’ equality with the Father (5:18; 19:7). us, </p>
<p>Martha’s confession has three dierent titles for Jesus, each with dierent </p>
<p>emphasis, but conveying the same truth.</p>
<p>Jesus’ mourning over Lazarus’ death (11:28–37) </p>
<p>Aer confessing Jesus as the Messiah, the Son of God, Martha rushed </p>
<p>home to call her sister and said to her privately, “e teacher is here and </p>
<p>is calling you” (11:28). It is more reasonable to take the Greek word lathra </p>
