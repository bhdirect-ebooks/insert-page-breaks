<p>e Authorities’ Rejection of Jesus’ Proclamation</p>

<p>it goes (Ezek 47:1–12; cf. Zech 14:8). e life of the Spirit received by the </p>
<p>believer is dynamic to reach out many others. In 7:37–38a, Jesus refers to </p>
<p>himself in the rst-person personal pronoun, “me,” but in the scriptural </p>
<p>quotation he uses the third-person personal pronoun, “Out of his heart </p>
<p>shall ow rivers of living water” (7:38b), obviously denoting the inward </p>
<p>being of the one who by faith receives the Spirit and becomes a life-giving </p>
<p>source to others.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>We are justied, then, if we put the full stop aer “drink”</p>
<p>and take “the one who believes in me” with 7:38.</p>
<p>e phrase “as the scripture said” (7:38b) points to any relevant OT </p>
<p>passage rather than the rabbinic writings, which Jesus never recognized as </p>
<p>“the scripture.” e exact wording of the scriptural quotation in 7:38 cannot </p>
<p>be conned to one OT passage alone. e notion of living water that ows </p>
<p>from God’s presence into the believers, who, in turn, become the rivers of </p>
<p>life-giving water, may be a blending of such OT passages as Ezek 47:1–12; </p>
<p>Zech 14:8; and Isa 58:11, perhaps with an allusion to Joel 3:18.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>e pouring of the Spirit into people’s hearts is expressed by the sprin-</p>
<p>kling of water upon God’s people so that they may walk in his ways and </p>
<p>that other nations may know the greatness of the Lord (Ezek 36:23, 25–27; </p>
<p>37:14). is is the essence of God’s new covenant made with his people so </p>
<p>that they may become a new covenant community (Jer 31:31–34). Against </p>
<p>this background, 7:38–39 anticipates God’s new covenant community, </p>
<p>founded by Jesus and stabilized by the Spirit. e rivers of living water will </p>
<p>ow from this community to give new life to others.</p>
Opinions are divided among people on Jesus’ messianic status (7:40–
<p>44; cf. 7:25–27, 31). When people heard Jesus’ words, some confessed that </p>
<p>Jesus is really “the prophet” (7:40), perhaps like Moses (Deut 18:15, 18) or </p>
<p>Elijah (Mal 3:1; 4:5). In John, the titles “the prophet” and “the Christ” do </p>
<p>not refer to the same gure (1:20–21), although both of them are associ-</p>
<p>ated with the end-time salvation. Others, however, believed that he is the </p>
<p>Christ. e crowd, which said that no one will know where Christ comes </p>
<p>from (7:27), now raises the question, “Does the Christ come from Galilee?,” </p>
<p>which expects the answer “no” (7:41; cf. 7:52), for such a powerful political </p>
<p>gure as Christ cannot come from the backward region of Galilee, particu-</p>
<p>larly from Nazareth (cf. 1:45–46).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some who had known the scriptures rightly said that </p>
<p>Christ comes from the seed of David (cf. 2 Sam 7:12–16; Ps 18:50; 89:3–4, </p>
<p>12. Kruse 2008: 192; Köstenberger 2009: 240–41. </p>
<p>13. Isa 44:3 and Joel 2:28 too may throw light on 7:38; Keener 2005: 1.726.</p>
