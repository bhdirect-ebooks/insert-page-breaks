<p>Samaritans’ confession of Jesus as the Savior of the world, then, would have </p>
<p>provoked the adherents of other religions and the Roman government.</p>
<p>By appreciating Jesus as the one who delivers people from their evil </p>
<p>deeds, the woman, along with her fellow citizens, entered into Jesus’ new </p>
<p>community because of the hard labor of Jesus done without food and drink. </p>
<p>John shows that the new covenant community of Jesus includes Jews, non-</p>
<p>Jews, and half-Jews like Samaritans; it is a multiethnic community! </p>

<p>Jesus set his journey to Galilee aer two fruitful days in Samaria (4:43). </p>
<p>Jesus’ departure from Samaria to Galilee is described as a situation that ts </p>
<p>the proverb, “A prophet does not have honor in his own hometown” (4:44). </p>
<p>Jesus had good response in Sychar of Samaria. Similarly, the Galileans wel-</p>
<p>comed him when he came to Galilee (4:45). Where was he dishonored? </p>
<p>Which country does Jesus refer to as his “own hometown”? In the Synoptic </p>
<p>Gospels, the same proverb is used in connection with the unbelief Jesus </p>
<p>faced in Nazareth in Galilee, where he was brought up and which is re-</p>
<p>garded as his hometown (Matt 13:57 par.). e reason for Jesus going to </p>
<p>Galilee was that he had no honor in his own hometown (the Greek particle </p>
<p>oun, “therefore,” is used in 4:45).</p>
<p>Some scholars argue that the Greek word used is patris, meaning </p>
<p>“fatherland,” which, for John, is Judea. If so, 4:44 should be read in com-</p>
<p>bination with 4:1–3. But the word patris is used in the Synoptic Gospels to </p>
<p>indicate Nazareth as Jesus’ hometown. We may probably solve the puzzle </p>
<p>by observing the geographical location of Nazareth. In rst-century Pales-</p>
<p>tine, Nazareth was situated in the southern part of Galilee (“lower Galilee”), </p>
<p>where there were descendants of Judean settlers a century earlier.</p>

<p> Naza-</p>
<p>reth almost lies on the road that links south and north. When Jesus traveled </p>
<p>to Cana of Galilee (cf. 4:46) from Samaria, going through Nazareth would </p>
<p>have been the normal route. But Jesus avoided his “hometown” because of </p>
<p>their unbelief and rejection of him and went to upper Galilee, where people </p>
<p>welcomed him enthusiastically, as they had seen Jesus’ signs performed in </p>
<p>Jerusalem. ere is an invisible reference, then, to Nazareth in 4:44.</p>
<p>Jesus visited again Cana of Galilee, where he had turned water into </p>
<p>wine earlier (4:46). A royal ocial (basilikos) came up from Capernaum </p>
