<p>Four Witnesses to Jesus Who Judges the “Judges”</p>

<p>equality with the Father.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>erefore the Father bears witness to the</p>
<p>Son and attests the signs performed by him on the Sabbath. Jesus ac-</p>
<p>cuses his accusers that in spite of all these, they did not believe in the </p>
<p>one sent by the Father and therefore that his words were not abiding </p>
<p>in them (5:38). </p>
<p>4. e Jewish scriptures, according to Jesus, bear witness to him. e </p>
<p>plural “scriptures” indicates various writings in the OT and primar-</p>
<p>ily the ve books of the Law (cf. 5:46–47). e Jewish authorities </p>
<p>searched the scriptures, as they believed that they have eternal life in </p>
<p>them (5:39). e verb “to search” (the scriptures) is a technical term </p>
<p>used in rst-century Judaism for the study and exposition of the Law </p>
<p>(e.g., 1QS 5.11). e Jews believed that the study and interpretation of </p>
<p>the scriptures would lead them to the life in the world to come (Gen </p>
<p>Rab. 1:19). Nevertheless, they have missed out, perhaps due to their </p>
<p>legal reading, “the hermeneutical key provided by God’s present rev-</p>
<p>elation” in Jesus.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Since the whole of the OT testies to Jesus (5:46),</p>
<p>eternal life is in him. ey would receive life if they would come to </p>
<p>him, but they were not willing to do so (5:40). </p>
<p>From this point onwards, Jesus accuses his opponents for their self-</p>
<p>ishness and false belief in Moses. In contrast to them, Jesus does not seek </p>
<p>to be honored by human beings (5:41), because God has already granted </p>
<p>him the honor that he deserves to receive from humans (5:23). Because </p>
<p>of their selsh ambition for glory from one another, they do not seek the </p>
<p>glory that comes from the only God (John 5:44; cf. Rom 2:29; 2 Cor 10:18; </p>
<p>1 ess 2:4). “e only God” would remind the authorities of the Jewish </p>
<p>faith in one God whose honor alone matters. Jesus categorically states that </p>
<p>it is dicult for them to believe in the one sent by the Father if they seek to </p>
<p>receive honor from one another. In fact, “the Jews” do not really love God </p>
<p>and hence they do not believe Jesus, who has come from the Father with </p>
<p>his authority (5:42–43a). Jesus hypothetically says that if any false prophet </p>
<p>who speaks in his own name or falsely in the name of the Lord (cf. Jer </p>
<p>23:25; 29:9, 25, 31; Deut 18:20) comes to them, they will accept him, for </p>
<p>both the Jewish leaders and false prophets seek their own honor and gain </p>
<p>14. e halakic principle says, “An agent is like the one who sent him,” in the sense </p>
<p>that both are one in will and work (cf. Ashton 1991: 314). However, there is no essential </p>
<p>oneness in this principle as we have it in Jesus, God’s agent (cf. 12:44–45).</p>
