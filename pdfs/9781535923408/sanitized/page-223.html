<p>JOHN 20</p>
<p>Visions of the Risen Jesus</p>
<p>The Resurrection of Jesus (20:1–10) </p>
<p>e resurrection narrative begins with a reference to Mary Magdalene, who </p>
<p>went to Jesus’ tomb early, while it was still dark, on the rst day of the week, </p>
<p>that is, the day aer the Sabbath (Sunday), and who was shocked to see the </p>
<p>stone removed from the tomb (20:1). She came to the tomb alone, probably </p>
<p>to see the tomb (Matt 28:1) or to anoint Jesus’ body with spices (Mark 16:1; </p>
<p>Luke 24:1), or to lament at the tomb, as Jewish women used to do for their </p>
<p>dear ones who had died (11:31; Gospel of Peter 50). With great anxiety and </p>
<p>fear, she ran and went to Peter and the beloved disciple. </p>
<p>Mary told them, “ey took the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not </p>
<p>know where they have laid him” (20:2). “ey” may imply Jesus’ enemies or </p>
<p>tomb robbers. She identies Jesus as “the Lord,” which is God’s name, used </p>
<p>for the risen Jesus by the rst Christians (cf. 20:13, 18, 25, 28; 21:7, 12). e </p>
<p>plural “we” in her report may imply that there were other women with her.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In the late-rst-century context, it could denote collectively the Johannine </p>
<p>Christians over against Jewish opposition.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Mary Magdalene did not see</p>
<p>the body of Jesus in his tomb and did not know where it was being kept. </p>
<p>Peter and the other disciple, who is introduced as the disciple loved </p>
<p>by Jesus (20:2), came out and went toward the tomb. ey ran “together at </p>
<p>the same time” (duo homou in Greek), but the beloved disciple ran quicker </p>
<p>than Peter and came rst to the tomb (20:3–4). He bent down and looked </p>
<p>inside the tomb. He saw only the linen cloths lying and not Jesus’ body. </p>
<p>Peter, who followed him, went into the tomb rst and found the linen wrap-</p>
<p>pings lying and the face cloth that had been round Jesus’ head rolled up </p>
<p>by itself (20:5–7). Following Peter, the other disciple also went in and saw </p>
<p>everything and believed (20:8). </p>
