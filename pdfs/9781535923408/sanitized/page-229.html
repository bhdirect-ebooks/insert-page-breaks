<p>church will receive the same response, both positive and negative, to their </p>
<p>life and ministry performed with the authority of the Holy Spirit. e sins </p>
<p>of those who accept the church’s message and believe in Jesus will be for-</p>
<p>given (cf. 8:34, 36) and the sins of those who do not will be retained (cf. </p>
<p>3:18–21; 9:40–41). In this sense, Jesus’ followers will forgive or retain sins. </p>
<p>Apart from this, 20:23 does not endorse the sacrament of penance.</p>
<p>Jesus’ encounter with omas (20:24–29) </p>
<p>20:24–29 discloses that omas was not there with the disciples when the </p>
<p>risen Jesus appeared to them (20:24). omas is rst named as “one of the </p>
<p>Twelve,” the “Twelve” being a xed term for the twelve disciples even aer </p>
<p>Judas Iscariot le Jesus. en as “the Twin,” a term that did not necessar-</p>
<p>ily mean literal twins.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>e “other disciples” mentioned in 20:25 refers to</p>
<p>those to whom the risen Jesus appeared earlier. ey told omas, “We </p>
<p>have seen the Lord” (20:25a). John makes them to confess Jesus as “the </p>
<p>Lord,” the name of Yahweh that was ascribed to Jesus by the early church by </p>
<p>virtue of his resurrection. e apostolic characteristic of having seen Jesus </p>
<p>as the Lord (cf. 20:18) is exhibited by the disciples. omas plainly said that </p>
<p>he will not believe unless he sees in Jesus’ hands the print of the nails and </p>
<p>touches the mark of the nails and his pierced side (20:25b).</p>
<p>omas’ words cannot be taken negatively as a doubt of Jesus’ resur-</p>
<p>rection, as many interpret today.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>is interpretation overlooks that even</p>
<p>some of the Twelve doubted Jesus’ resurrection and that the Twelve at rst </p>
<p>did not believe, but labeled it “an idle tale” (Matt 28:17; Mark 16:11, 13–14; </p>
<p>Luke 24:11). e disciples could believe only aer seeing Jesus alive (20:20). </p>
<p>omas, though lacked faith, wanted to experience the truth personally by </p>
<p>seeing the risen Jesus and touching his wounds before he would believe.</p>
<p>e risen Jesus appeared once again when all the disciples, includ-</p>
<p>ing omas, were in the house still behind the shut doors on the eighth </p>
<p>day aer his resurrection (20:26a). He came through the shut doors once </p>
<p>more, stood among them, and declared peace (20:19b, 26b). Now he spoke </p>
to omas personally, as he had known by divine knowledge what all
<p>12. e beginning of the Gospel of omas identies omas with Judas (not Is-</p>
<p>cariot), who was regarded as Jesus’ brother (Mark 6:3), but there is no evidence that any </p>
<p>of Jesus’ brothers was among the twelve disciples. In John 14:22 Judas is distinguished </p>
<p>from omas.</p>
<p>13. Lincoln (2006: 502) comments that omas’ response involves “an adamant re-</p>
<p>fusal to believe”; Keener (2005 2.1209) thinks that omas is skeptical.</p>
