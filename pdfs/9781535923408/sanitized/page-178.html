<p>Jesus’ Promise to Send the Paraklētos </p>
<p>150</p>
<p>he will teach his disciples all things, and he will remind them all that Je-</p>
<p>sus said (14:26). “Teaching all things” and “Reminding all that Jesus said” </p>
<p>convey the same meaning. e remembrance of the disciples of the signi-</p>
<p>cance of Jesus’ acts and sayings aer his departure is the work of the Spirit </p>
<p>(2:22; 12:16). </p>
<p>At this point, Jesus pronounces “peace” that he leaves with them, de-</p>
<p>ning it as “my peace,” which is dierent from the peace that the world </p>
<p>gives (14:27a). Jesus’ peace is not a mere farewell greeting used in Jewish </p>
<p>and Greek circles</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>or a state of welfare free from worldly suerings, but it is</p>
<p>a gi of God’s presence, salvation and life to be enjoyed at present and at the </p>
<p>end-time (cf. Ps 29:11; Isa 52:7; 57:19; Ezek 37:26). erefore the hearts of </p>
<p>the disciples need not be troubled or be afraid (14:27b; 14:1a). is double </p>
<p>assurance with the same meaning gives hope for Jesus’ community to have </p>
<p>peace in the midst of persecution in the world. Jesus goes to the Father who </p>
<p>is greater than him (14:28b). However, he will come to them, as he already </p>
<p>told them, to make his home with them by the Spirit and eventually to take </p>
<p>them to the Father’s house (14:28a; cf. 14:3, 18, 23).</p>
<p>When there is oneness between the Father and the Son (10:30), how </p>
<p>do we understand Jesus’ statement, “e Father is greater than I?” Certainly </p>
<p>Jesus spoke and worked in subjection to the Father (5:19, 30; 11:41–42; </p>
<p>12:49; 14:31; 15:10), even while he spoke and worked in oneness with the </p>
<p>Father (e.g., 1:1c, 14; 3:34; 5:17; 8:28; 12:49). Jesus could not have lived with </p>
his two natures separately—divine nature to show his oneness with God
<p>and human nature to speak of his subordination. Both equality with and </p>
<p>subjection to the Father existed in Jesus. Real equality is manifested, even </p>
<p>in human relationships, in one’s submission to another person. Within the </p>
<p>spectrum of equality there is an element of the Son’s subordination to the </p>
<p>Father to fulll the mission of saving the world.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> Both unity and subordi-</p>
nation, and divinity and humanity dwelling together, are two facets of one
<p>truth. is paradox is the “mystery of incarnation.”</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>e Son, who was</p>
<p>equal with the Father (Phil 2:6), voluntarily accepted subordinate role to </p>
<p>minister to humankind. Since Jesus is going to the Father, who is greater </p>
<p>than he, the disciples would have rejoiced if they loved him, for it is to their </p>
<p>advantage that he is going (14:2–3; 16:7a).</p>
