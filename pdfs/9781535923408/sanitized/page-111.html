<p>Sukkah 4:9; etc.), probably for securing rain.</p>

<p>is ritual pouring of water</p>
<p>and the lighting of the lamps ceased on the seventh day (m. Sukkah 4:1, </p>
<p>9–10). e eighth day of the feast was a day for “solemn assembly” and for </p>
<p>a special food oering to be given to the Lord (Lev 23:36). Jesus would have </p>
<p>chosen the eighth day as the right time to proclaim about the living water </p>
<p>(7:37–38) and light (8:12) to the people assembled. On this day, Jesus stood </p>
<p>up and cried out (7:37). Jesus’ standing posture indicates that his message </p>
<p>is a public prophetic announcement more than his earlier proclamation </p>
<p>in the temple (7:28). Jesus’ act of crying out marks his proclamation to all </p>
<p>pilgrims about his gi of outowing life (cf. 1:15; 7:28; 12:44).</p>
<p>Jesus’ proclamation in 7:37b–38 may be understood in two ways, de-</p>
<p>pending upon the placement of the full stop: </p>
<p>1. “Let anyone who is thirsty come to me, and let the one who believes in </p>
<p>me drink. As the Scripture has said . . .” (NRSV). is rendering would </p>
<p>mean that the rivers of living water will ow from Jesus.</p>
<p>2. “If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. Whoever believes </p>
<p>in me, as the Scripture has said, . . .” (ESV, RSV, NIV). is reading </p>
<p>would mean that the rivers of living water will ow from the heart of </p>
<p>the believer.</p>
<p>Some scholars think that Jesus’ “heart” (literally “belly”) means his </p>
<p>inmost part</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>from where the living water ows (cf. 4:10, 14a; 6:35b; 19:34;</p>
<p>20:22). Jesus is the source and giver of living water and the one who be-</p>
<p>lieves in him will never thirst (John 4:14; 6:35; cf. Prov 9:5; Sir 24:19–21; </p>
<p>51:23–24). ey point out its appropriateness for the feast of Tabernacles </p>
<p>when the water is poured for ritual cleansing and the lights are lit to il-</p>
<p>luminate the temple. Jesus calls people to receive the living water from him </p>
<p>instead of pouring out the ritual water and reveals himself as the Light of </p>
<p>the world. However, it does not explain how the water received by the be-</p>
<p>liever outows to give life to others (cf. 4:14b). </p>
<p>e phrase “rivers of living water” symbolizes the Spirit, which those </p>
<p>who believe in him will receive by virtue of Jesus’ exaltation on the cross </p>
<p>and ascent to the Father (7:39). Jesus calls each person to come to him </p>
<p>and drink (7:37). “Drinking” is the same as believing in him (7:38a; 4:14b). </p>
<p>When believers receive it, it will ow out through them as saving power, just </p>
<p>like the water that ows from the temple gives life to all creatures wherever </p>
