<p>JOHN 15</p>
<p>Jesus’ Pastoral Speech II</p>
<p>The true vine and the branches (15:1–17) </p>
<p>John 15 opens abruptly, without any phrase of transition, with Jesus’ nal “I </p>
<p>am” saying: “I am the true vine” (15:1a). is implies that Jesus is still giving </p>
<p>instruction in the supper hall. He uses the metaphor of vine and branches </p>
<p>to describe the tripartite relationship between the Father, the Son, and their </p>
<p>new community. Jesus is the true vine, meaning that he is the genuine and </p>
<p>authentic vine in contrast to the earthly vine, for Jesus is from God who is </p>
<p>true (7:28; 17:3; cf. 1:9; 6:32). </p>
<p>Several OT passages speak of the people of Israel and Judah, who were </p>
<p>supposed to be fruit-bearing vine or vineyard but failed to give the fruit ex-</p>
<p>pected by Yahweh (Ps 80:8–19; Isa 5:1–7; 27:2–6; Jer 2:21; 6:9; 8:13; 12:10; </p>
<p>Ezek 15:1–8; 17:1–10; 19:10–14 and Hos 10:1). However, we can hardly </p>
<p>argue along with Barrett that Jesus bore the fruit Israel failed to,</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>for Jesus,</p>
<p>in John, is pictured as the source of life to all those who live in union with </p>
<p>him so that they may bear fruit. John 15 shows that whereas Israel and </p>
<p>Judah failed to bear fruit and glorify God, those who remain in Jesus’ love </p>
<p>and words can bear fruit and glorify God. Israel’s failure can be turned into </p>
<p>victory if anyone remains in Jesus.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Jesus asserts, “My Father is the vinedresser” (15:1b), meaning that </p>
<p>God is the planter and protector of the vine and its branches in his gar-</p>
<p>den.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>He does everything to keep the branches in union with the vine. Any</p>
<p>branch that is not united with Jesus does not yield fruit and God takes away </p>
<p>such branches, but he enables the fruit-bearing branches to bear more fruit </p>
<p>by pruning them (15:2). is metaphor shows that God enables the believer </p>

<p>takes care of the vineyard; Köstenberger 2009: 451.</p>
