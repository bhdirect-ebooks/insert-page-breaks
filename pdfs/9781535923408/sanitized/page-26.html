<p>e Docetists, on the other hand, claimed that Jesus Christ </p>
<p>did not truly come in the esh, and that his esh was only an </p>
<p>appearance. For them Christ only seemed to be a man. us the </p>
<p>Docetists refused to accept the humanity of Jesus.</p>
<p>In the late rst century there seems to have been followers </p>
<p>of Gnosticism in its embryonic stage. Gnosticism claimed that </p>
<p>people became ignorant by the inuence of evil forces and that </p>
<p>God sent his messenger to cast away their ignorance and give </p>
<p>them salvation in terms of the knowledge (gnōsis) that they be-</p>
<p>long to the other world. eir dualistic thought led the Gnostics </p>
<p>to reject Christ who came in esh, presuming that a holy God </p>
<p>cannot take up human esh, which is evil. John argues against </p>
<p>such teachings, saying that eternal life is possible in “knowing” </p>
<p>the only true God who was manifested in Jesus (17:3).</p>
<p>d. e inuence of these heresies began to threaten the love and </p>
<p>unity that existed in the Johannine church and led the members </p>
<p>into perplexity about the person Jesus and his teachings, par-</p>
<p>ticularly his teaching on end-time events. While John’s Gospel </p>
<p>foresees a threat to the unity in the church (cf. 17:21–23), 1 John </p>
<p>indicates that the split has already taken place (cf. 1 John 2:19).</p>
<p>(v) In the late rst century there was an intermingling of religious and </p>
<p>philosophical ideas; cults and philosophies inuenced one another. It </p>
<p>does not seem that John was “inuenced” by Hellenistic and Gnostic </p>
<p>ideas as such, but he uses language and ideas familiar in the religious </p>
<p>and philosophical environment.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> John thus seems to have been writ-</p>
<p>ten in a pluralistic context quite similar to our own time.</p>
<p>Why Was the Gospel of John Written?</p>
<p>We may now pose the question as to why John was written when the other </p>
<p>three canonical Gospels were already in circulation.</p>
<p>Some suggest that John was written to supplement the Synoptic Gos-</p>
<p>pels in content, chronology, and interpretation and to produce what Clem-</p>
<p>ent of Alexandria (ca. 150–215 CE) called “a spiritual Gospel,” as it was </p>
<p>believed that the other three Gospels contain only the earthly aspects of </p>
