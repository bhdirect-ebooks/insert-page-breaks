<p>to Jesus) to be his followers (17:6, 10). e parallel phrase “his own people” </p>
<p>(1:11b) conrms that those who did not receive the Light were Jesus’ own </p>
<p>people, the Jews. It is noteworthy that only those who keep the covenant </p>
<p>made by God are his “treasured possession” (Exod 19:5). However, the Jews </p>
<p>who received God’s covenant belonged to the old and fallen humanity, and </p>
<p>therefore they could not perceive the Logos-Light as the Messiah. John, in </p>
<p>contrast, will declare in his Gospel that it is the people of God, under the </p>
<p>new covenant, who will be “his own possession” (cf. 1:12). </p>
<p>In spite of the world’s rejection, God oered opportunity to the Jews </p>
<p>and Gentiles to receive the Logos and to become his children. “Receiving” </p>
<p>is the receptive aspect of believing. e object of faith is “his name.” In the </p>
<p>OT, God manifests his character and work by revealing, or sometimes by </p>
<p>concealing, his name, YHWH or “I am that I am” (e.g., Gen 32:27–30; Exod </p>
<p>3:13–14; 6:2–3; Isa 42:8). e Johannine Jesus bears this name so that he </p>
<p>may manifest it to those who believe in him (17:6, 26). By revealing God’s </p>
<p>name, Jesus reveals God himself. is powerful name of God enables those </p>
<p>who receive him and believe in his name to be born in the family of God </p>
<p>as his children, that is, to become members of new covenant community </p>
<p>(1:12).</p>
<p>John discloses the source of new birth both in negative terms (i.e., </p>
<p>neither of blood nor of the will of esh nor of the will of man) and in posi-</p>
<p>tive term (i.e., of God). e new covenant community comes into being by </p>
<p>the Spirit, the life-giving power of God, and not by any human eort (John </p>
<p>1:13; 3:3–8; cf. Deut 32:18; Ps 2:7).</p>

<p>Dwelling of the Logos-in-esh among humans (1:14, 16–18)</p>
<p>is section constitutes the h strophe of the hymn (1:1–18) and is the </p>
<p>climax of what John wants to say in the prologue. His statement “the Word </p>
<p>became esh” (1:14a) would have kept many in astonishment in the late </p>
<p>rst century, since no philosophical or religious thought understood the </p>
<p>concept of Logos in this way. e birth narratives of Matthew and Luke are </p>
<p>summed up by John in one sentence: “And the Word became esh.” </p>
<p>e conjunction “and” stresses the transition of the Logos from his </p>
<p>pre-existent state to human history. Whereas 1:1 shows the transcendence </p>
<p>6. While the reference to the blood and esh indicates mortal humanity (Matt 16:17; </p>
<p>1 Cor 15:50), the expression “the will of man” reects the Jewish belief that a woman </p>
<p>begets a child by a man’s initiative.</p>
