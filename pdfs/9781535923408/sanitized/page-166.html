<p>Washing of the Disciples’ Feet</p>

<p>the world by love and humble service, the sent ones too should do the same </p>
<p>so that they may have the joy of the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Jesus’ immediate statement “I am not speaking of you all” (13:18a), </p>
<p>refers to those who inherited God’s blessings by imitating Jesus. However, </p>
not all can inherit divine blessings. He knows each disciple whom he chose
<p>(15:16). Judas will lose God’s end-time blessings because of his self-surren-</p>
<p>der to the devil to betray Jesus (cf. 6:70–71; 13:2, 27). Judas’ betrayal is sup-</p>
<p>ported by the quotation from Ps 41:9 (cf. Ps 55:12–13), where the psalmist </p>
<p>groans to the Lord that his close friend, who ate his bread, turned hostile </p>
<p>to him.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Judas is described as the one who ate bread with Jesus, for he was</p>
<p>with Jesus closely, heard his message, and experienced God’s love in him. </p>
<p>But eventually he violently acted against Jesus! He lied up against him the </p>
<p>very heel washed by Jesus!</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>e fulllment of the Scripture implies that</p>
<p>Judas’ treachery against Jesus was within the written will of God.</p>
<p>e statement “From now on, I am telling you before it happens” </p>
<p>points to the forthcoming betrayal by Judas. Judas’ treacherous act will </p>
<p>indeed lead other disciples to believe Jesus as “I am” (13:19), the revelation </p>
<p>of the eternally existent and incomparable God, for Judas’ act sets the stage </p>
<p>for Jesus to be lied up on the cross (8:24, 28, 58). e “I am” statement is </p>
<p>followed by a mission-focused statement with the “truly, truly, I say to you” </p>
<p>formula as a conrmed truth: “e one who receives some one whom I will </p>
<p>send receives me, and the one who receives me receives the one who sent </p>
<p>me” (13:20). Jesus’ “I am” statement in 13:19 expresses his oneness with </p>
<p>God in revelatory terms, whereas 13:20 expresses this oneness in functional </p>
<p>terms.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> Anyone who, in the course of Christian mission, receives Jesus re-</p>
<p>ceives the God who sent him (cf. Matt 10:40 par.). is anticipates 20:21, </p>
<p>where Jesus, aer his glorication, will send his followers into the world on </p>
<p>his mission.</p>
<p>9. In the NT, the word makarioi (“blessed”) has the idea of joy in the future kingdom </p>
<p>of God, which can be possessed even now; Brown 1978: 2.553.</p>
<p>10. “Liing one’s heel against” someone means “liing up one’s hand against” another </p>
<p>person or “rising up against” someone (2 Sam 18:28, 31; 20:21).</p>
