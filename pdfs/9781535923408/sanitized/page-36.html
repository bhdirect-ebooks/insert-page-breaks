<p>Prologue</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>means “only one of its kind,” but when used in relation to the Father it </p>
<p>means the “only Son.”</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Aer introducing the Logos as God and narrating</p>
<p>that the glory revealed is that of the only Son from the Father, John would </p>
<p>not have hesitated to call the “only Son” as the “only God” (cf. 1:18 in some </p>
<p>manuscripts). In sharing with God oneness in life, glory, name, status, and </p>
<p>function, there is no one who is equal to the status of Jesus as God’s Son and </p>
<p>therefore Jesus is the only Son of God. From 1:14 onwards the pre-existent </p>
<p>Logos is spoken in John in terms of the “Son of God.”</p>
<p>God’s steadfast love and faithfulness to his covenant, which constitute </p>
<p>his glory, are termed as “his fullness” in 1:16.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>All those who believe through</p>
<p>the witness of the Johannine community received “grace upon grace.” Liter-</p>
<p>ally, the phrase “grace upon grace” can be translated as “grace in the place of </p>
<p>grace.” It does not mean that in place of the Mosaic Law the grace through </p>
<p>Jesus was given, for John never opposes the Law in his Gospel. e Law </p>
<p>that marks the old covenant was also a gi of God given to his people out </p>
<p>of his grace. is means that the OT manifestation of God’s gracious love </p>
<p>and favor has become accessible to all who believe in Christ, replacing the </p>
<p>impossible observance of the OT Law by a personal and unique manifesta-</p>
<p>tion through his Son.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>us, “grace upon grace” implies God’s continuous</p>
<p>supply of the same grace, expressed through the Law, from one degree to </p>
<p>another by the gracious indwelling of Jesus.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>All human eorts to keep the</p>
<p>Law in order to experience God are thereby made redundant. </p>
<p>e steadfast love and faithfulness of God, given in the OT Law in </p>
<p>a shadowy way, have attained reality in the coming of the Logos-in-esh, </p>
<p>“Jesus Christ” (1:17). e phrase “given through Moses” implies the role </p>
<p>of mediator played by Moses in giving the Law (cf. Gal 3:19b). e major </p>
<p>aspect of God’s covenant with his people is God’s giving of the Law (Deut </p>
<p>5:1–21), which is the “Book of the Covenant” that was sealed by the oer-</p>
<p>ing of the “blood of the covenant” (Exod 24:7–8). e reference to the Law </p>
<p>given through Moses (1:17), then, has an implicit reference to the covenant </p>
<p>community. However, John looks beyond this old covenant community to </p>
<p>a new covenant community that will be established in Jesus Christ, through </p>
<p>whom came to humankind God’s “grace and truth.” ese dual words allude </p>
