<p>Entry of a Roman Ocial’s Family into God’s Community</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>to meet Jesus at Cana and asked him to come down to heal his son who </p>
<p>was about to die due to fever (4:47, 52). e reference to the ocial’s ser-</p>
<p>vants (4:51) shows that this man was a government ocial who was serv-</p>
<p>ing Herod Antipas (4 BCE–39 CE), a tetrarch known as “king” (Matt 14:9; </p>
<p>Mark 6:14–22).</p>
<p>John records that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee (4:47, 54), </p>
<p>overlooking his journey to Samaria. Due to the deep hatred between Sa-</p>
<p>maritans and Jews, Jesus’ successful ministry in Samaria could have been </p>
<p>kept secret. Whether the ocial was a Jew or Gentile is not clear in the text. </p>
<p>e similarity of this story with the story of healing of a Gentile centurion’s </p>
<p>servant (Matt 8:5–13; Luke 7:1–10) gives the clue that the royal ocial in </p>
<p>4:46–54 might have been a Gentile,</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>for there were many types of royal</p>
<p>administrative ocials in Capernaum, as it was a commercial town.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jesus rebuked him by saying, “Unless you see signs and wonders you </p>
<p>will never believe” (4:48). us Jesus discourages “believing” by merely </p>
<p>“seeing” signs. Both “you see” and “you will never believe” are in plural </p>
<p>form and thus the ocial is seen as the representative of Roman ocials, </p>
<p>rather than the whole of the Galileans,</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>who would always like to see signs</p>
<p>from Jesus. Some argue that the mild rebuke is reminiscent of his rebuke </p>
<p>directed to the Jewish authorities for asking for a sign (Matt 16:4 par.) and </p>
<p>therefore that the ocer must be a Galilean Jew.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>However, the rebuke to</p>
<p>the Jews is sharper than the rebuke to the ocial in John. In the Synoptic </p>
<p>Gospels, Jesus did not perform a sign on their request, whereas in John </p>
<p>Jesus did heal the ocial’s son. Perhaps Jesus rebuked him in order to bring </p>
<p>him to true faith (cf. Matt 15:21–28 par.). e ocial persistently invited </p>
<p>Jesus to come down to Capernaum before his child dies (4:49).</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> He ap-</p>
<p>pealed to Jesus humbly, by addressing him as “sir” (kyrie; cf. 4:15, 19), with </p>
<p>the belief that if only Jesus came and touched, his dying son would receive </p>
<p>life. However, unexpectedly Jesus commanded him, “Go, your son lives” </p>
<p>(4:50). Jesus’ words have power to give life even from a distance, just like </p>
<p>God’s word brought life (Gen 1). </p>

<p>26. e word “come down” implies that Capernaum was in the lower of part of Gali-</p>
<p>lee, about two hundred meters below sea level, whereas Cana was situated on a plateau.</p>
