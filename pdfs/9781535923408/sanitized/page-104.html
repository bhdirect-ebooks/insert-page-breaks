<p>Jesus’ Dialogue with His Disciples</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>However, Jesus says that some of them do not believe (6:64) and hence </p>
<p>they take oense at spiritual things. e expression “some of you” refers to </p>
<p>“many of his disciples” (6:60, 66) as well as the disciple among the Twelve </p>
<p>who will betray Jesus. He foreknew “from the beginning” (i.e., from the </p>
<p>beginning of Jesus’ ministry and his choosing of the disciples</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>) those who </p>
<p>would not believe and the one who would betray him. Jesus’ foreknowledge </p>
<p>of the people proves that he came from heaven, where he was with the Fa-</p>
<p>ther. e readers will know later that Judas Iscariot is the one who would </p>
<p>betray him (cf. 6:70–71; 13:2, 21–30). e reference to Judas’ betrayal shows </p>
<p>that Jesus’ journey to the cross has already begun. </p>
<p>As some of the hearers, including “his disciples,” did not actually be-</p>
<p>lieve in Jesus and his words, but took oense at them, Jesus reminds them </p>
<p>of the initiative of the Father in drawing believers unto him (6:37, 44, 45). </p>
<p>Surprisingly, many of his disciples did not accept Jesus’ sayings, and this </p>
<p>proves that no one can come to him unless the enabling power of God is </p>
<p>granted to them (6:65). </p>
<p>All the disciples who did not receive Jesus’ words turned back and </p>
<p>would no longer walk with him (6:66). Unbelief leads eventually to losing </p>
<p>communion with Jesus and to denying that the Son of God came in the </p>
<p>esh (1 John 2:19, 22; 4:2–3; 2 John 7). With great concern, Jesus asks the </p>
<p>twelve disciples whether they also wish to depart (6:67).</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>On behalf of the</p>
<p>disciples, Simon Peter conrms their allegiance to their Master by answer-</p>
<p>ing, “Lord, to whom shall we go?” ough it is a question, it is actually </p>
<p>a statement that there is no one whom they can follow except Jesus, not </p>
<p>because he performs signs, but because he has the words that give eternal </p>
<p>life (6:68). A faith anchored in Jesus as Lord and in his words leads the </p>
believer to have divine life.
<p>In their encounter with Jesus, Peter and his fellow disciples came to </p>
<p>the knowledge and acceptance that Jesus is the “Holy One of God” (6:69). </p>
<p>e confession that Jesus is the “Holy One of God” is unique to John. e </p>
<p>title makes Jesus equal to the Lord God, who is the “Holy One of Israel” </p>
<p>and who chose the people of Israel to fulll his purpose on earth (Isa 43:14; </p>
<p>47:4; 49:7; 54:5). Jesus, similarly, chose a new people of God to fulll God’s </p>
<p>purpose of redeeming the world and therefore he is the “Holy One of God” </p>
<p>(6:69–70). e Greek word for “holy” means consecrated or separated for </p>
<p>34. Ridderbos 1997: 248.</p>
<p>35. It seems the term “the Twelve” (6:67, 70, 71) became, by the time John was writ-</p>
<p>ten, a standard title for the inner circles of Jesus’ disciples, including Judas Iscariot.</p>
