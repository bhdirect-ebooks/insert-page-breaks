<p>Jewish Rejection of Jesus Intensied</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>(cf. 5:39; 8:17; 15:25). By saying so, Jesus is distancing himself from the </p>
<p>Jews who wrongly understood the Law. e quotation comes from Ps 82:6, </p>
where the term “gods” means the divine council whose members are the
<p>“sons of the Most High” (Ps 82:1, 6b). e context implies that Yahweh, </p>
<p>the judge, will bring justice to the weak, the fatherless, and the needy (Ps </p>
<p>82:1b, 3–4), but will pronounce destruction on the judges and leaders who </p>
<p>failed to do justice (Ps 82:2–7). Jesus argues that if God, who made Moses </p>
<p>a god to Pharoah (Exod 7:1) and who called even the unjust judges and </p>
<p>false leaders “gods,” how can they accuse Jesus, who was consecrated and </p>
<p>sent into the world, that he blasphemes by saying, “I am the Son of God” </p>
<p>(10:34–36)? If Scripture itself, which cannot be disobeyed, uses the term </p>
<p>“god” of someone besides God himself, how much more appropriate is the </p>
<p>use of the term for Jesus?</p>

<p>Jesus challenges his accusers that they need not believe him, if his </p>
<p>works are not the works of “my Father” (10:37). en he invites them to </p>
<p>believe his works so that they may perceive that the Father is in him and </p>
<p>he in the Father (10:38; cf. 14:10–11), for his signs themselves will show to </p>
<p>them his oneness with the Father in terms of their mutual indwelling. In </p>
<p>spite of Jesus’ teaching, the authorities seek to arrest him (10:39; cf. 7:30; </p>
<p>11:57), but Jesus escapes from their hands.</p>
<p>Others who believed in Jesus (10:40–42) </p>
<p>Jesus crossed the Jordan again and went to “Bethany beyond Jordan,” a </p>
<p>place of springs, situated perhaps on the eastern side of Jordan in northern </p>
<p>Peraea, and this is the place where John was baptizing at rst (10:40; cf. </p>
<p>1:28; 3:23). Jesus remained there and many who had seen his signs came to </p>
<p>hear his words. ey were so inuenced by Jesus’ life and words that they </p>
<p>exclaimed that whatever John, without doing any sign, said about Jesus </p>
<p>was true (10:41). No wonder many believed in Jesus there, perhaps as the </p>
<p>Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p>e whole ministry of Jesus narrated in 1:19—10:39 is concerned with </p>
<p>Jesus’ words and works that led him to a conict with his Jewish opponents </p>
<p>basically on the issue of who Jesus is. e conict eventually led Jesus to the </p>
<p>cross, which becomes clear in the subsequent chapters, particularly aer </p>
<p>Lazarus was raised from the dead (11:47–53; 12:7, 23; 13:1–3; etc.). e </p>
<p>cross will project Jesus as Christ, the King of the Jews and the Son of God, </p>
<p>14. See Keener 2005: 1.829.</p>
