<p>John 6:35–59</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>shows ironically that “our fathers,” who ate manna in the wilderness (6:31), </p>
<p>are indeed their fathers in showing unbelief and grumbling.</p>
<p>ey understood Jesus and his coming into the world in earthly terms, </p>
<p>for they questioned among themselves, “Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph, </p>
<p>whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, ‘I have come </p>
<p>down from heaven’?” (6:42; cf. Matt 13:55–57a par.). e claim of having </p>
<p>come down from heaven implies Jesus’ pre-existence with God and hence </p>
<p>his oneness with the Father. “e Jews” are oended at this claim and show </p>
<p>thus their unbelief in the virginal conception of Jesus.</p>
<p>Knowing their murmuring, Jesus admonishes them not to murmur </p>
<p>among themselves (6:43). He reiterates in 6:44 what he spoke in 6:39–40 </p>
<p>and thereby conrms his pre-existence in heaven whence he came down. </p>
<p>Jesus speaks of the magnetic power of God to draw people to him, by say-</p>
<p>ing, “No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him” </p>
<p>(6:44; cf. 6:65). e rabbis used the word “to draw” or “to bring nigh” to </p>
<p>speak of bringing a person to the Law for conversion (m. ’Abot 1:12), mak-</p>
<p>ing them sharers in the knowledge of God.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>John uses the same word to</p>
<p>refer to God drawing people to Jesus, in whom they can fulll the Law and </p>
<p>share in the knowledge of God. e correlation between God’s everlasting </p>
<p>love and his power to draw people unto himself is found in Jer 38:3 LXX </p>
<p>(31:3 in English).</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>e work of drawing people unto Jesus belongs to the</p>
<p>Father who sent Jesus. God works in oneness with the Son. In fact, the word </p>
<p>“drawing” people to Jesus looks forward to the cross (12:32), and also to </p>
<p>the future resurrection of those who are thus drawn (cf. 6:39–40). e task </p>
<p>of raising the dead to life is the sole prerogative of God (cf. 5:21), and it is </p>
<p>given to the Son.</p>
<p>Although the Father draws people to Jesus, human beings have the </p>
<p>responsibility to come to Jesus by hearing and learning from the Father </p>
<p>(6:45). is is in accordance with what is written in the prophets. e plural </p>
<p>“the prophets” occurs only here in John, while he cites the writing of only </p>
<p>one prophet, Isa 54:13, perhaps as an example. John changes the particular-</p>
<p>ity found in Isa 54:13 MT (“All your sons shall be taught by the Lord”) and </p>
<p>LXX (“And I shall make your sons to be taught by God”) into universality </p>
<p>by using the indenite plural in 6:45. What was applicable to the people of </p>
<p>Israel is now made applicable to every one. e idea that all shall be taught </p>
<p>by God in the scriptures is related to the new covenant, for one of the marks </p>
