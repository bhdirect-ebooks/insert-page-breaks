<p>Jesus’ Self-Revelation as the Life-Giving Bread</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>e people now raise another question: “What shall we to do the </p>
<p>works of God?” (6:28). Jesus responds that the work of God is nothing but </p>
<p>to believe in him whom God sent (6:29). People thought that they can earn </p>
<p>eternal life by good works (cf. Matt 19:16), perhaps works of the Law.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>Jesus exhorted them just to believe in him. By using the singular “work,” </p>
<p>Jesus brings all good works under the umbrella of believing in him. “Believ-</p>
<p>ing” is the positive response of humans to Jesus, and good works spring </p>
<p>out of that response. at God sent Jesus is a recurring theme in John (see </p>
<p>comments on 3:17; 4:34; 5:37–38).</p>
<p>e people raise their third question in two forms: What sign, then, </p>
<p>can you do, that we might see and believe you? And what work can you </p>
<p>perform (6:30; cf. 2:18)? e same crowd that was fed with ve loaves and </p>
<p>two sh challenges Jesus to do another sign to lead them to faith! is </p>
<p>means that they expected Jesus to keep on giving them food miraculously </p>
<p>(cf. 6:34). In support of their desire, they quote the OT and boast of their </p>
<p>forefathers who ate manna in the wilderness given from heaven (6:31). It </p>
<p>is actually an indirect question: “Can you do for us again what Moses did, </p>
<p>that we may believe you?” Some think that the OT quotation is closer to Ps </p>
<p>78:24.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>However, it seems to be a combination of words found in several</p>
<p>OT passages (Exod 16:4, 15; Neh 9:15; Ps 78:23–24; 105:40).</p>
<p>e people’s reference to “the bread from heaven to eat” (Exod 16:4, </p>
<p>14–15) becomes the key for Jesus to unlock the meaning of the manna </p>
<p>given in the wilderness. He responds with the phrase “Truly, truly, I say to </p>
<p>you” to introduce the reliable heavenly truth. At rst, he refutes their un-</p>
<p>derstanding that it was Moses who gave them bread from heaven.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>en he</p>
<p>assures them that “my Father” gives them now the true bread from heaven </p>
<p>(6:32). Unlike the manna, which satised the people’s physical hunger only </p>
<p>temporarily, Jesus says that this authentic bread, which also comes down </p>
<p>from heaven, gives life now to the world at large (6:33). e true bread </p>
<p>which God gives now is Jesus (cf. 6:35), who came down from heaven to </p>
give divine life to all humans (cf. 3:13–16; 5:24–26, 29; 6:27). Jesus’ saying
<p>in 6:32–33 may also indicate the present fulllment in him of the Jewish </p>
<p>19. Beasley-Murray 1987: 91.</p>
<p>20. Borgen 1968: 41; Daly-Denton 2000: 5–9, 131–44.</p>
<p>21. Jesus uses the plural “you” as recipients of the heavenly manna, because, as per </p>
<p>Jewish belief, the present generation is in solidarity with their forefathers physically.</p>
