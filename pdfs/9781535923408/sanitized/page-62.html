<p>Jesus’ Testimony before Nicodemus</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>the giver of life (6:27), he himself is life (11:25; 14:6). e words “whoever </p>
<p>believes in him” in 3:15–16 show the universal eect of Jesus’ exaltation on </p>
<p>the cross and also the inclusive nature of God’s new community. </p>
<p>e universal eect of Jesus’ mission is obvious in Jesus’ continuous </p>
<p>teaching to Nicodemus who remains still a silent listener (3:16–21). e </p>
<p>conjunction “for,” and the reference to the availability of eternal life to ev-</p>
<p>eryone who believes in the Son (3:16) link the whole section with 3:13–15. </p>
<p>e word “only Son [of God]” is synonymous to the title “Son of Man” in </p>
<p>3:14 (cf. 5:26–27). Jesus assures of God’s intensive love for sinful humanity, </p>
<p>which, however, loves darkness rather than light (3:19). “God so loved the </p>
<p>world” means “this is how [houtōs] God loved the world” (NJB): by hand-</p>
<p>ing over the Son of Man to be crucied to remove human sin and give new </p>
<p>life (3:16).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e manner and content of God’s love is expressed by the statement </p>
<p>“... that he gave his only son.” Abraham’s oering of his only and beloved </p>
<p>son, Isaac (Gen 22:2, 9–10, 16), pregures God’s gi of his unique Son not </p>
<p>only to be oered on the cross as a sacrice to take away human sin (John </p>
<p>1:29, 36; 8:32; 1 John 4:9–10), but also to raise him up from the dead to </p>
<p>grant new life for those who believe (Heb 11:17–19). God’s purpose of giv-</p>
<p>ing his Son is that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may </p>
<p>have eternal life (3:16; cf. 3:15). Both “eternal life” and “perishing,” being </p>
<p>end-time events, are opposed to each other. e former denotes salvation </p>
<p>of the believers and the latter the eternal condemnation of those who do </p>
<p>not believe in the Son. Human destiny has only these two ends. Such dual-</p>
<p>ism is used in John to urge human beings to choose life (cf. Deut 30:18–19).</p>
<p>God giving his only Son is parallel to God sending his Son into the </p>
<p>world. God did not send his Son to condemn the world, but to save the </p>
<p>world through the Son (3:17). e phrase “not to perish” (3:16) is inter-</p>
<p>preted as “not to condemn,” and the phrase “to have eternal life” (3:16) is </p>
<p>interpreted as “to save.” e term “everyone” is read in 3:17 as a collective </p>
<p>term “the world,” meaning the sphere of human life. e word “sending” </p>
<p>has a missional thrust. e purpose of Jesus’ mission in the world is to save </p>
<p>all people from eternal destruction and to give heavenly life to those who </p>
<p>allow him to direct their lives. “e one who does not believe is condemned </p>
<p>already” (3:18) implies that anyone who does not accept God’s provision </p>
<p>for human salvation is already judged as guilty and hence is given up to </p>
<p>death. Jesus did not come to judge the world, but to save it from the power </p>
