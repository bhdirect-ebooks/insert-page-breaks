<p>e Son’s Authority to Give Life and to Judge</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>the dead to be judged at “an hour” of the Father (5:25, 28). e criterion </p>
<p>to judge all human beings is “the hour” of Jesus’ death on the cross, which </p>
<p>gives choice to people either to accept or reject him. us, “an hour” de-</p>
<p>notes the eects of “the hour” (cf. 2:4). e Son’s judgment has both present </p>
<p>and future implications, with an emphasis on future life aer death (5:25). </p>
<p>“Do not marvel at this” (5:28; cf. 3:7) means that mere emotional amaze-</p>
<p>ment cannot lead to eternal life.</p>
<p>In an hour of nal resurrection at the voice of the Son of God, those </p>
who did good works will inherit divine life and those who did evil will face
<p>God’s eternal punishment (John 5:28–29; cf. Dan 12:2; Rom 2:6–11). e </p>
<p>term “works” does not mean works of the Law, but works of faith in the </p>
<p>crucied Son of Man. e Son will judge with the authority given to him by </p>
<p>the Father (5:30; 8:16), because he is the Son of Man (5:27). e Son of God </p>
<p>is identied here with the Son of Man (cf. 3:14–16; for the Son of Man as </p>
<p>eschatological judge see Matt 25:31–46; 1 En. 37–71; T. Abr. 11–13; 4 Ezra </p>
<p>11–13). As the Son of Man, Jesus represents both humanity and God (Dan </p>
<p>7:9–27) and salvation comes to humanity through the same Son of Man by </p>
<p>his death on the cross. Since salvation is inseparable from judgment, the </p>
<p>Son of Man becomes also the agent of God’s judgment. </p>
<p>e Johannine Jesus, who is dependent on the Father, cannot do </p>
<p>anything on his own initiative and he judges as he hears from the Father </p>
<p>(5:30a). His will to act ows from the Father who sent him (5:21, 30b) and </p>
<p>therefore his judgment is right.</p>
<p>Four witnesses to Jesus who judges the “judges” (5:31–47)</p>
<p>e Jewish Law demands two or three witnesses to prove any claim of a </p>
<p>crime as true (Deut 19:15; cf. Matt 18:16). Jesus is accused by the authorities </p>
<p>that he unlawfully works on the Sabbath and that he makes himself equal </p>
<p>to God (5:18). But they, who should prove the charges by witnesses, fail to </p>
<p>do so. Now, ironically, the accused puts forward four witnesses against his </p>
<p>accusers. </p>
<p>By denying that he bears witness to himself, the Son follows the prin-</p>
<p>ciple that one’s self-witness cannot be accepted as reliable (5:31; cf. 8:13). </p>
<p>ere is “another,” which denotes the Father (cf. 5:37), who bears witness </p>
<p>to Jesus. Since God is true (John 17:3; 1 John 5:20; Rev 3:7), his witness to </p>
<p>Jesus is trustworthy (5:32; cf. 8:18). </p>
