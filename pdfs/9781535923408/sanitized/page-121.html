<p>John 8:21–30</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>conrm his identity in terms of his oneness with the Father by answering, </p>
<p>“Why do I even speak to you at all?”</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>(8:25b). It does not mean that Jesus</p>
<p>has nothing to tell them. He has always been identifying himself as the one </p>
<p>who is “from above” (8:14, 23) or “I am [he]” (8:12, 24, 28, 59) or “I and the </p>
<p>Father who sent me” (8:16, 18) and ascribing to himself and the Father the </p>
<p>common task of judging, bearing witness, and speaking (8:16, 18, 23, 26). </p>
<p>But still “the Jews” do not understand, because of their unbelief and earthly </p>
<p>inclinations, that Jesus speaks about the Father who is true (8:26–27). Jesus </p>
<p>thus has actually much to say and judge about his opponents, but he speaks </p>
<p>to the world only what he hears from the Father (8:26). </p>
<p>Jesus predicts that his critics will come to perceive Jesus’ oneness with </p>
<p>the Father aer they li him up on the cross (8:28a). e idea of the Son </p>
<p>of Man being lied up on the cross (3:14) appears again here, but with a </p>
<p>reference to the Jewish authorities who will li him up. Once they crucify </p>
<p>Jesus, “the Jews” will realize that he is the “I am,” the revelation of God’s love </p>
<p>and salvation. Jesus’ exaltation will put them to shame by showing that they </p>
<p>could not destroy him and that he did not speak on his own authority, but </p>
<p>spoke what the Father taught him (8:28b). Jesus thus reveals his submission </p>
<p>to the Father within his oneness.</p>
<p>Jesus emphasizes again that he who sent him is with him always (8:29). </p>
<p>e cross may prima facie show that Jesus is le alone by God. But because </p>
<p>Jesus always performs what is pleasing to God, the oneness between Jesus </p>
<p>and the Father and Jesus’ submission to accomplish God’s mission cannot </p>
<p>be broken. Jesus’ words led many to believe in him (8:30).</p>
<p>Jesus’ verbal attack on the hostile Jews (8:31–47) </p>
<p>Jesus exhorts the Jews who believe in him to remain in his word in order to </p>
<p>be his true disciples (8:31). is is the same instruction given to the twelve </p>
<p>disciples (15:7). In John, “believing” and “abiding in” are interrelated: those </p>
<p>who do not believe the one sent by God cannot have his word abiding in </p>
<p>them (5:38). e truth, which they will experience in him (1:14, 17), Jesus </p>
<p>continues, will make them free (8:32). Obedience to Jesus’ word will lead </p>
the believers to know the truth, the divine reality, and will free them from
<p>the bondage of sin (8:34, 36).</p>
