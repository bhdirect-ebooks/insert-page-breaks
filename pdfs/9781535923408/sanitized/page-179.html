<p>John 14:15–31</p>
<p>151</p>
<p>Jesus’ purpose in telling is that when it takes place they may believe </p>
<p>(14:29). e object of faith is not specied. In this context, it means that the </p>
<p>disciples, by seeing all things happening as Jesus foretold, will believe his </p>
<p>words and come to a new understanding of Jesus and his mission. At the </p>
<p>end of the rst part of his speech, Jesus refers to the “ruler of this world” (cf. </p>
<p>12:31) who is coming. erefore, he tells them that he will no longer talk </p>
<p>much with them. In the coming of the ruler of the world, Jesus sees that the </p>
<p>hour of his death, which is the climax of his combat with the devil, is ap-</p>
<p>proaching. e devil succeeded in coming into Judas Iscariot to make him </p>
<p>betray his Master (6:70–71; 13:2, 18, 27), but he cannot overpower Jesus </p>
<p>to prevent him from going to the Father through the cross. In this sense, </p>
<p>the ruler of the world has no authority or claim on Jesus (literally, “he has </p>
<p>nothing over me”; 14:30).</p>
<p>In spite of the coming of the powerless evil one, Jesus does as the </p>
<p>Father has commanded him and this obedience proves that he loves the </p>
<p>Father (14:31a). Jesus’ death, resurrection, ascension, and his coming again </p>
<p>are in accordance with the Father’s command. Immediately Jesus says, </p>
<p>“Rise, let us go from here” (14:31b). is instruction gives the sense that </p>
<p>Jesus’ Pastoral Speech is concluded. However, 18:1 indicates that Jesus and </p>
<p>his disciples le the place only aer his discourse and prayer. Moreover, it is </p>
<p>unlikely that Jesus’ further discourse that contains such important subjects </p>
<p>(John 15 and 16) and his intensive prayer (John 17), would have been said </p>
<p>on the way in a casual setting. Jesus’ instruction is simply to rise from the </p>
<p>place of reclining and go to a convenient place in the same hall so that Jesus </p>
<p>might continue his discourse on other pertinent matters. </p>
