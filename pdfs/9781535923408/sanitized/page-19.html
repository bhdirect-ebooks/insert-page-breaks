<p>Introduction</p>
<p>ere have been many commentaries on the Gospel of John since 125 </p>
<p>CE, when the Valentinian gnostic leader Heracleon rst wrote one. </p>
<p>Commentators, particularly aer the Reformation, have usually taken an </p>
<p>exegetical and sociohistorical approach. Some scholars have used rhe-</p>
<p>torical criticism, a social-scientic approach, narrative criticism, and/or a </p>
<p>sociorhetorical perspective based on literary/rhetorical and cultural per-</p>
<p>spectives for interpreting John.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Any writing of the rst century needs to be set in its historical, reli-</p>
<p>gious, and social contexts for a proper understanding of its complexity. Pre-</p>
<p>vious studies have located John’s Gospel in a context of purported conict </p>
<p>between Jewish Christians and the unbelieving Jews in the late rst centu-</p>
<p>ry.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>By observing the literary and rhetorical texture of John’s Gospel, Keener</p>
<p>attempts to reconstruct the social contexts in which John was written.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>events recorded in the Gospel and the writings of the late rst century and </p>
<p>early second century help us to reconstruct the historical situation in which </p>
<p>John’s Gospel was probably written.</p>
<p>In this commentary I attempt to set the Fourth Gospel in its historical </p>
<p>setting and then to show that the vision of Jesus for the world, according </p>
<p>to John, goes beyond his sacricial death, resurrection, and appearance to </p>
<p>the constitution and function of a new humanity, called “God’s new com-</p>
<p>munity,” that is bound to God by the new covenant made in Jesus.</p>

<p>Who Wrote John’s Gospel and Where?</p>
<p>John’s Gospel declares that it was written by “the disciple whom Jesus </p>
<p>loved,” who “has seen” the crucied Jesus and has borne witness (19:35), </p>
<p>1. E.g., Culpepper 1989; Stibbe 1993; Malina and Rohrbaugh 1998; and Neyrey 2007.</p>
<p>2. Cf. Brown 1978: 1.lxxii–lxxv; idem 1979: 166–67; Martyn 2003: 37–62; Dunn </p>
<p>1983: 318–25.</p>
<p>3. Keener 2005: 1.xxv, 140–70.</p>
<p>4. Pryor calls this community “the covenant community” (Pryor 1992: 157–80).</p>
