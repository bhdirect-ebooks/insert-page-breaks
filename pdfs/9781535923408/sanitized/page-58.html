<p>Jesus’ Testimony before Nicodemus</p>

<p>faith and shows him later as the one who spoke for Jesus in the Jewish </p>
<p>council (7:45–52) and who gave a royal burial to him (19:30–42).</p>
<p>Nicodemus was impressed with the signs that Jesus performed and </p>
hence believed that Jesus was a teacher who came from God with divine
<p>power (3:2). In this sense, he represents those who believed in Jesus aer </p>
<p>seeing his signs (2:23). At the initial stage, Nicodemus had only partial un-</p>
<p>derstanding of Jesus (cf. 4:19; 9:30–32, 36).</p>
<p>Jesus knew Nicodemus’s imperfect knowledge and equally his in-</p>
<p>ner thirst for heavenly reality. erefore he tells him, by using the phrase </p>
<p>“Truly, truly, I say to you,” that only those who are born from above can </p>
<p>experience heavenly life under God’s rule (3:3). e Greek word anōthen </p>
<p>used has two meanings: “again” and “from above” (3:31; 19:11, 23; cf. 8:23). </p>
<p>Both meanings complement each other, for the experience of being born </p>
<p>again (“new birth”) comes from God who is above (1:13). e idea of be-</p>
<p>coming children of God by a new birth (1:12–13) is developed in 3:3 as the </p>
<p>prerequisite to enter the kingdom of God (cf. Matt 18:3). e new commu-</p>
<p>nity of Jesus is a community that comes under God’s rule by experiencing </p>
<p>new birth from above. </p>
<p>e same idea of being born from above is explained by Jesus in 3:5, </p>
<p>aer Nicodemus expressed his non-understanding of birth from above by </p>
<p>his question, “How can a person be born aer having grown old? Can one </p>
<p>enter a second time into the mother’s womb and be born?” (3:4). John uses </p>
<p>the literary technique of non-understanding so that the heavenly truth may </p>
<p>be revealed clearly. John 3:3 and 3:5 are mutually interpreting. e word </p>
<p>“seeing” in 3:3 is replaced by “entering” and the word “from above” by “of </p>
<p>water and Spirit” in 3:5. “Seeing” in John means both physical sight and </p>
<p>spiritual perception. It denotes “experiencing” or “tasting” (3:36; 8:51, 53) </p>
divine life by the power of God’s Spirit. us, “seeing” and “entering” are
<p>identical in meaning. However, “entering” emphasizes the act of coming </p>
<p>into the realm of God’s reign and see God as King. What is the meaning of </p>
<p>“water and spirit” which interprets “from above”? </p>
<p>e main issue of interpretation concerns whether the term “water” </p>
<p>refers to a baptism of repentance or to the Jewish proselyte baptism or to </p>
<p>Christian baptism. Almost all scholars agree that “spirit” here means the </p>
<p>outpouring of the Holy Spirit which brings regeneration (see Ezek 36:25–</p>
<p>27, where “water” symbolizes the Spirit of God). at water baptism is a </p>
<p>prerequisite for entering the kingdom of God is found neither in the NT </p>
<p>nor in any other Christian writings. Even the Baptist’s baptism is a symbol </p>
