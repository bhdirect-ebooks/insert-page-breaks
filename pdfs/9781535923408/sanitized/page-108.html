<p>Veiled References to Jesus as the Christ</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>Jesus denies that his teaching is his own, but confesses that it is of “the </p>
<p>one who sent me” (7:16). “Teaching” in John is a collective term denoting </p>
<p>the “words of revelation” received from God and spoken by Jesus (cf. 3:32, </p>
<p>34; 8:26–28; 12:49; 14:24; 18:19–20). By saying this, Jesus indirectly reveals </p>
<p>his heavenly origin and status as the Christ, who pre-existed with God. </p>
<p>However, human beings, at the natural level, cannot grasp whether Jesus’ </p>
<p>teaching comes from God or he speaks on his own accord,</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>unless they</p>
<p>wish to do God’s will (7:17). </p>
<p>Anyone who speaks on his own authority naturally wishes his own </p>
<p>name to be honored. In contrast, he who speaks for the one who sent him </p>
<p>seeks the sender’s name to be exalted. Jesus does not seek his own glory </p>
<p>(5:41; 8:50, 54) but the glory of the Father who sent him (cf. 5:44). If God is </p>
<p>true to his words, the one who speaks God’s words also must be true to his </p>
<p>words (7:18; cf. 3:33; 7:28). us there is no wickedness in Jesus. While he is </p>
<p>guiltless, Jesus asks, “Why do you seek to kill me?” (7:19). If they plan to kill </p>
<p>him (7:25; cf. 5:18), then they are not really obeying the Law given to them </p>
<p>by Moses, who wrote of Jesus (5:46). e people immediately accuse Jesus </p>
<p>of being demon possessed (cf. 8:48, 52; 10:20) and ask him sarcastically, </p>
<p>“Who is seeking to kill you?” (7:20). “Having a demon” means “being out </p>
<p>of one’s mind” or “being controlled by evil spirits.”</p>

<p>Jesus refers to the healing of the paralytic done on the Sabbath as “one </p>
<p>deed” at which all were marveling (7:21). He argues that Moses gave the law </p>
<p>of circumcision not merely for purication (Lev 12:1–3), but for the sake </p>
<p>of restoring human lives, as the phrase “because of this” (7:22) shows. In </p>
<p>fact, the law of circumcision was given earlier than Moses to the patriarchs </p>
<p>like Abraham as a mark of covenant with God to preserve one’s life (Gen </p>
<p>17:10–14; 21:4). us, circumcision actually was not from Moses, but from </p>
<p>the patriarchs, each of whom was called “our father” (4:12; 8:39).</p>
<p>e rabbis permitted circumcision to be done on the Sabbath if the </p>
<p>child had been born on the previous Sabbath (m. Šabb. 18:3; 19:1–2; m. </p>
<p>Ned. 3:11; t. Šabb. 15:16; b. Yoma 85b),</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>by treating this as the fulllment of</p>
<p>Mosaic Law. Jesus argues that if on the Sabbath circumcision of a single part </p>
<p>of the body can be done as per Moses’ Law, which cannot be broken, how </p>
<p>3. e Greek phrase translated “on his own” (7:17b, 18a) can mean either “on his own </p>
<p>authority” or “on his own initiative”; Zerwick and Grosvenor 1988: 308.</p>
