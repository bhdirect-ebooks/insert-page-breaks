<p>Jesus’ Appearances to the Male Disciples</p>

<p>and function of the whole church (cf. 1 Cor 12:7). e disciples on whom </p>
<p>the life of Jesus was breathed represent the universal community of God </p>
<p>that will be guided by the Holy Spirit on earth. Is this giving of the Holy </p>
<p>Spirit the Johannine Pentecost? Some scholars argue that functionally the </p>
<p>Pentecost event in Acts 2 and Jesus’ gi of the Spirit in John 20:22 are the </p>
<p>same.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>However, if 20:22 denotes the Pentecostal event, how is it that even</p>
<p>aer receiving the Spirit the disciples were inactive, keeping themselves </p>
<p>behind the shut doors (20:26)? </p>
<p>We should note that the gi of the Spirit is not one-time event, but </p>
<p>that it is the continuous manifestation of God’s power through the church </p>
<p>in its mission, which, against the narrow understanding of proclamation </p>
<p>and planting churches, encompasses the complete life and work of the </p>
<p>church.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>e gi of the Spirit in the form of Jesus’ breath is a preliminary</p>
<p>empowerment of Jesus’ disciples to live and serve in the world. omas was </p>
<p>not present when Jesus breathed on the disciples, and the place of Judas </p>
<p>remained vacant. e outpouring of the Spirit will happen only aer the </p>
<p>circle of the twelve disciples become complete by replacing Judas with Mat-</p>
<p>thias (Acts 1:21–26), to form the new Israel, the church. John’s narrative of </p>
<p>Jesus’ giving of the Spirit, being a symbolic act, anticipates the outpouring </p>
<p>of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2), when Jesus’ promise of </p>
<p>the Holy Spirit (7:38–39; 14:16–17, 26; 15:26; 16:7) will fully be realized.</p>
<p>e main function of God’s new community that has received the </p>
<p>Holy Spirit is to forgive the sins of others that their sins may be forgiven or </p>
<p>to retain the sins of any that their sins may be retained (20:23). is is par-</p>
<p>allel with Jesus’ statement, “Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in </p>
<p>heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven” (Matt </p>
<p>16:19; 18:18). For the Jews, “binding and loosing” expressed the activity </p>
<p>of a judge who declared persons innocent or guilty and thus “bound” or </p>
<p>“loosed” them from the charges made against them.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> Similarly, the Spirit-</p>
<p>lled community has authority to judge people, a function inherited from </p>
<p>Jesus (5:27; cf. Isa 22:22). Retaining sins does not mean that Christ’s com-</p>
<p>munity should show an unforgiving attitude towards sinners.</p>
<p>20:23 may be interpreted in the light of Johannine dualism, which ex-</p>
presses that the coming of Jesus and his message of salvation divide people
<p>into two groups, believers (“insiders”) and unbelievers (“outsiders”). e </p>
