<p>John 9:35–41</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>God in Jesus and his heavenly origin. Some of the Pharisees ask him, “We </p>
<p>are not blind. Are we too?” (9:40). Jesus’ answer implies that the Pharisees </p>
<p>are actually blind to the truth that Jesus is the Christ who came down from </p>
<p>God and who was prior to and greater than Moses. Were they to accept that </p>
<p>they are blind to this truth, they would have no sin, because they would, </p>
<p>then, humble themselves and be freed from sin. However, until now they </p>
<p>bear their sin because they claim proudly, “We see” (9:41).</p>
<p>e climax of Jesus’ dialogue with the healed man comes as the latter </p>
<p>asks Jesus to identify the Son of Man so that he may believe in him (9:36), </p>
<p>and Jesus reveals himself by saying, “You have seen him, and it is he who </p>
<p>speaks to you” (9:37; cf. 4:26). Since the man believes him, eventually he </p>
<p>acknowledges Jesus as “Lord” and worships him (9:38). We can observe a </p>
<p>growth in the man’s understanding of Jesus, as it was with the Samaritan </p>
<p>woman: he understood him rst as a man (9:11), then as a prophet (9:17), </p>
<p>aerwards as “the man from God” (9:33), and nally as the Son of Man </p>
<p>who came from heaven to render judgment and as the Lord who is to be </p>
<p>worshipped (9:37).</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>12. e man would not have necessarily understood the Son of Man to be the Mes-</p>
<p>siah, but John’s readers would have.</p>
