<p>e Pharisees’ Investigation on the Healing</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>works and prayers of sinners, but that he approves the works and prayers </p>
<p>of anyone who worships God and does his will (9:31). ereby their claim </p>
<p>that Jesus is a sinner is refuted by a man who was born blind. Worship of </p>
<p>God and doing his will are two inseparable acts of God’s new community.</p>
<p>e healed man’s second logical point is that since the beginning of the </p>
<p>world no one has ever heard, if not seen, any human who has opened the </p>
<p>eyes of a man born blind (9:32), and yet that is what Jesus did, so he must </p>
<p>be from God, and cannot be classied as a sinner. e man is convinced </p>
<p>that unless Jesus had come from God, he could do nothing such as opening </p>
<p>of a blind man’s eyes (9:33). Instead of accepting the man’s testimony, the </p>
<p>teachers of the Law reject his words by saying, “You were born fully with </p>
<p>sins and are you teaching us?” (9:34). Jesus’ healing of the man from his </p>
<p>blindness shows God’s love to forgive his sins, but the Pharisees treat him </p>
<p>as one who was born in complete sin. In their pride, they are not willing to </p>
<p>accept the teaching given by a man who got new insight from Jesus, but cast </p>
<p>him out of Jewish community and rob his religious freedom. is action </p>
<p>foreshadows the expulsion of Christians from the synagogue in the late rst </p>
<p>century</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> and the persecution faced by them even today.</p>
<p>Jesus’ self-revelation as the Son of Man (9:35–41) </p>
<p>e last scene brings Jesus in to reveal himself fully to the healed man and </p>
<p>to disclose the blindness of the Jewish leaders. Soon aer they cast the </p>
<p>healed man out, Jesus found him (9:35) and gave him wholeness by bring-</p>
<p>ing him to the right understanding of himself. Abruptly Jesus asks him, </p>
<p>“Do you believe in the Son of Man?” Probably he wanted to assure the man </p>
<p>that Jesus descended from heaven, where he was before (3:13; 6:62), and </p>
<p>that he will not cast out anyone who comes to him (6:37). </p>
Jesus divulges that the purpose of his coming from God into the world
<p>is for judgment (5:27), which is paradoxically twofold: he came so that those </p>
<p>who do not see may see and those who see may become blind (9:39).</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>He</p>
<p>came to give sight to those who would believe him as the Son of Man who </p>
<p>came from God. e healed man exemplies this. However, those who do </p>
<p>not accept this truth may physically see, but they lack spiritual insight to see </p>
<p>10. Kanagaraj 2005: 315.</p>
<p>11. Jesus’ statement that he came into this world for judgment does not contradict his </p>
<p>statements in 3:17 and 12:47. Jesus’ coming is generally for the salvation of the world, but </p>
<p>those who do not believe in him keep themselves under judgment (3:18) and thus Jesus’ </p>
<p>salvation turns to be the judgment for unbelievers.</p>
