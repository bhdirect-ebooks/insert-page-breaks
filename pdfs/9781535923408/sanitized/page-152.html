<p>Mary’s Anointing of Jesus</p>

<p>However, Mary might have been allowed to do anointing in this</p>
<p>fashion in order to ll the house with the fragrance of the perfume (12:3b) </p>
<p>and thus to share the family’s joy with other guests. ere could be royal </p>
<p>overtones in Mary’s anointing, an event followed by Jesus’ entry into Jeru-</p>
<p>salem, where he is hailed as “he who comes in the name of the Lord, even </p>
<p>the King of Israel” (12:13).</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Mary’s act, then, acknowledges Jesus as the</p>
<p>King of Israel, the Messiah who is to come. What Jesus will do before the </p>
<p>feast of the Passover (13:1–17) is pregured in Mary’s act of humility!</p>
<p>However, Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, who would betray Jesus, </p>
<p>views Mary’s act as a waste and suggests that the ointment could have been </p>
<p>sold and the money given to the poor (12:4–5). Unlike Matthew (26:8–9) </p>
<p>and Mark (14:4–5), John species Judas Iscariot as the one who murmured. </p>
<p>Although he may seem right, his motive was wrong, for he did not say it </p>
<p>with real care for the poor, but because he was a thief, the one who was </p>
<p>holding the money box and who took what was put in it (12:6). Perhaps he </p>
<p>used to steal money put in the box (cf. 13:29).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>His covetousness made him</p>
<p>to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver (Matt 26:15–16).</p>
<p>Jesus defends Mary by saying, “Leave her alone, so that she might keep </p>
<p>it for the day of my burial” (12:7). He reminds the guests that they have the </p>
<p>poor always with them (cf. Deut 15:11) and adds, “But you do not always </p>
<p>have me” (12:8), hinting at his departure to the Father through the cross </p>
<p>(13:1). For Jesus, the priority is to acknowledge him as the messianic King </p>
<p>and to spend anything costly for him rather than to give money to the poor </p>
<p>without real care for them. Mary’s act of sacricial anointing looks forward </p>
<p>to the day of Jesus’ burial. e outcome of Jesus’ death, which will spread </p>
<p>the fragrance of God’s sacricial love to the world, is already exhibited in </p>
<p>Mary’s anointing of his feet. Mary unknowingly performs a prophetic act.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the Johannine Jesus, Mary’s annointing is neither an act of penitence </p>
<p>(Luke) nor a preparatory act for future burial (Matthew and Mark), but an </p>
<p>act performed on the day of his burial. us he brings the meaning of his </p>
<p>death to be seen in the sacrice made by one of his female disciples even </p>
<p>before the Passover.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Mary’s anointing proclaims Jesus’ enthronement as</p>
<p>King on the cross in fulllment of God’s redemptive plan for humanity.</p>

<p>6. As Judas Iscariot is labeled as a thief, the statement “he used to take away” (ebasta-</p>
<p>zen) should be understood in terms of taking away for oneself from the money box.</p>
