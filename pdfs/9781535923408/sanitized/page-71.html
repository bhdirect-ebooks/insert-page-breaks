<p>John 4:7–26</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>word “now having” is deliberate to indicate that she was not living with a </p>
<p>legally married person. In conformity with the oriental view on morality, </p>
<p>the Samaritans also must have considered frequent remarriages as dishon-</p>
<p>orable and illegitimate.</p>

<p>Jesus touched the core of her life because he wished</p>
<p>to give eternal life to the marginalized woman and admit her into God’s </p>
<p>new community. </p>
<p>e woman took Jesus’ disclosure of her private life positively and saw </p>
<p>Jesus in a new light and said, “Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet” (4:19). </p>
She came to recognize Jesus as a prophet who had divine knowledge and
<p>words, for in Samaritan tradition prophecy was closely connected with the </p>
<p>power to know what had happened in the past and what was still to come.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>e woman’s initiation to discuss about worship on Mount Gerizim </p>
<p>conrms her understanding of Jesus as a taheb, the “coming one,” for the </p>
<p>Samaritans believed that the taheb will come to restore true worship by </p>
<p>purifying Mount Gerizim from all delement caused by the Jews. For them, </p>
<p>Mount Gerizim was the most holy of all mountains (cf. Ant. 18.4.1).</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Her</p>
<p>statement “our fathers worshipped on this mountain” (4:20) may imply </p>
<p>the OT patriarchs and those who started worshipping on Mount Ger-</p>
<p>izim, where the Samaritans built the temple ca. 388 BCE (cf. Deut 11:29; </p>
<p>27:12–13). However, the Jews regarded Jerusalem as the holy site where one </p>
<p>should worship (Deut 12:4–7, 21; 14:22–26; 1 Kgs 14:21; 2 Chr 12:13). e </p>
<p>long-time conict between Jews and Samaritans on the place of worship </p>
<p>is visible in the woman’s statement, “And you [i.e., the Jews] say that in </p>
<p>Jerusalem is the place where one must worship” (4:20b). </p>
<p>In response, by politely calling her “O woman” (cf. 2:4; 19:26), Jesus </p>
<p>invites her to believe him and his message (4:21a). Jesus calls her rst to </p>
<p>listen to his message and then mentions the importance of how and whom </p>
<p>one should worship rather than where one should worship. e phrase “an </p>
<p>hour is coming,” in which “hour” is used without the denite article, means </p>
<p>that this coming hour will see a change in the worship of God, with both </p>
<p>Gerizim and Jerusalem losing signicance aer “the hour,” the time set by </p>
<p>God for Jesus to suer, die, rise from the dead and nally to ascend to the </p>
<p>Father.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Jesus’ cross, which will bring a revival in worship, is anticipated</p>
<p>here.</p>
