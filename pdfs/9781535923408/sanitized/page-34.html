<p>Prologue</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>of the Word, 1:14 describes how he became immanent—the supernatural </p>
<p>natural, and the invisible visible.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> It would have been easier for understand-</p>
<p>ing the incarnation if John had simply written, “e Word was born as a </p>
<p>man” (cf. Phil 2:7b). Why should John use two catching words, “became” </p>
<p>and “esh”?</p>
<p>Some in the early church might have believed that by becoming a man </p>
Christ put o his divine glory in heaven (cf. Phil 2:7a). As observed above,
<p>there were heretics in the late rst century who questioned either Christ’s </p>
divinity or his humanity. e word “became” (egeneto) implies that by tak-
<p>ing human form the pre-existent Word did not cease to be God, just as Je-</p>
<p>sus continued to be Jesus of Nazareth even aer he became a prophet (Luke </p>
<p>24:19; cf. 3 John 8).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> It does not support a “naїve Docetism”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>that minimizes</p>
<p>the reality of Jesus’ humanity. In the earthly life of Jesus, his oneness with </p>
<p>the Father continued. Otherwise it would be impossible to see the Father’s </p>
<p>glory on earth.</p>
<p>e word “esh” goes beyond mere humanness and points to the </p>
<p>frailty and vulnerability of human beings (Isa 40:6; John 6:63).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>means that Jesus, by assuming human esh, experienced the weakness and </p>
<p>helplessness of human beings, enabling him to be compassionate toward </p>
<p>helpless sinners (cf. Rom 8:3; 2 Cor 8:9; Heb 2:17–18). John’s word “esh” </p>
<p>thus displays not merely a polemic purpose, but it also gives the good news </p>
<p>that the one God, who is inaccessible (1 Tim 6:16), came to live with the </p>
<p>fallen humanity.</p>
<p>is thought is carried forward by the statement “and he dwelt among </p>
<p>us” (literally “and he tabernacled in the midst of us”). e Logos becoming </p>
<p>esh and his dwelling among human beings go together, as the conjunction </p>
<p>“and” shows. e Greek word eskēnōsen (“he tabernacled/dwelt”) echoes </p>
<p>the dwelling of God among his people in the tabernacle (Exod 25:8–9; </p>
<p>29:45–46; Zech 2:10–11). Besides the wilderness motif, one can also see a </p>
<p>Wisdom motif</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>: e Creator chose the people of Israel as the tent where </p>
<p>Wisdom can dwell and minister before him (Sir 24:8, 10). What was applied </p>
<p>to Wisdom is now applicable to the Logos, though with a conceptual dif-</p>
<p>ference. e eschatological motif in 1:14b becomes obvious in its allusion </p>
