<p>of his pity for the bereaved (11:35).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>He wept with those who wept (Rom</p>
<p>12:15)! Jesus’ emotions of compassion and deep distress as a human and </p>
<p>his self-identication with the grieving humanity are intermingled in the </p>
<p>shortest verse, “Jesus wept” (11:35).</p>
<p>On seeing Jesus weeping, some mourners were astonished at the love </p>
<p>Jesus had habitually for Lazarus (11:36). However, others raised the ques-</p>
<p>tion, “Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have done </p>
<p>something that he would not even die?” (11:37). ough this is reasonable </p>
<p>question, it shows their unbelief in the healing power of Jesus, even aer </p>
<p>seeing his opening of eyes of a man born blind.</p>

<p>ey were also ignorant of</p>
<p>God’s way and time of performing signs.</p>
<p>Exit of Lazarus from the tomb (11:38–44) </p>
<p>With an agitated heart, Jesus came to the tomb. e word “again” indicates </p>
<p>that this is the second time that Jesus was emotionally moved (cf. 11:33). </p>
<p>Lazarus’ tomb was a cave with a stone laid upon it. e Jews usually buried </p>
<p>their dead in natural caves outside the village. Archaeological evidence sug-</p>
<p>gests that Lazarus’ tomb was horizontal with a square stone laid upon it.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>It</p>
<p>was probably an antechamber with an opening in the ground leading to the </p>
<p>actual burial chamber. e stone was laid at this opening. Jesus asked the </p>
<p>bystanders to take the stone away (11:39). Martha, the sister of the “dead </p>
<p>man,” prevented the removal of the stone by reminding that it was four </p>
<p>days since he died and therefore there will be an odor. Martha shows here </p>
<p>her little faith, in contrast to her faith shown earlier (11:22). John conrms </p>
<p>through Martha’s objection the reality of Lazarus’ death four days ago. is, </p>
<p>in turn, leads to the reality of his resurrection.</p>
<p>Jesus reminds Martha of his earlier injunction that if she would believe </p>
<p>she would see the glory of God (11:40). is assurance given to Martha is </p>
<p>not recorded by John, though he assured his disciples of the revelation of </p>
<p>the glory of God through Lazarus’ death (11:4). Possibly Jesus gave this </p>
<p>promise to Martha during his encounter with her outside the village. “See-</p>
<p>ing the glory of God” in Jesus’ signs and supremely on the cross is a re-</p>
<p>curring theme in John, probably as a polemic against the then-prevalent </p>
<p>interest in the ascent to heaven to see God’s kingly glory on the throne in </p>
