<p>e Functions of the Spirit</p>
<p>160</p>
<p>carries the sense of persuading the wrongdoer to change his mind (1QS </p>
<p>9.16–17). As Greek moralists believed, the word has an appeal to one’s con-</p>
<p>science (e.g., Det. 146). us the work of the Spirit is to convict the world’s </p>
<p>conscience of its sin and to convince humanity to change their minds to </p>
<p>receive either God’s righteousness or his judgment. Since the world cannot </p>
<p>receive the Holy Spirit (14:17), the work of conviction is mediated through </p>
<p>God’s new community.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>e Spirit of truth will convict the world that sin consists in its unbelief </p>
<p>in Jesus (16:9; cf. 3:18; 8:24; 15:22), for unbelief is the root of all evil deeds. </p>
<p>Secondly, he will convince the world to receive God’s gi of righteousness, </p>
<p>which became possible because of Jesus’ departure to the Father through </p>
<p>the cross and Jesus’ disciples will see him no more on earth (16:10). e </p>
<p>Spirit oers God’s righteousness (justication) for those who believe in </p>
<p>Jesus. irdly, the Spirit will convict the world of condemnation, in both </p>
<p>present and future experience, if they fail to believe and receive God’s righ-</p>
<p>teous status in Jesus. God’s verdict will be either to make a sinner righteous </p>
<p>or to keep the sinner under judgment. Just like God’s righteousness, his </p>
<p>condemnation also is assured because the ruler of this world is already </p>
<p>judged on the cross (16:11; 12:31). at is, the devil’s power is defeated. </p>
<p>Since the disciples are lled with grief over Jesus’ departure and their per-</p>
<p>secution, they cannot bear now the “many things” Jesus would like to say, </p>
<p>perhaps about the nature of his death and of his community’s similar fate </p>
<p>(16:12). Jesus turns again to the functions of the Spirit of truth in relation </p>
<p>to his followers (16:13–14):</p>
<p>(i) He will guide them into all truth. e verb “to guide” means “to lead </p>
<p>on one’s way” (cf. Ps 143:10). When situation becomes dark, the Spirit </p>
<p>will lead them on the way in all truth. “All truth” could mean Jesus </p>
<p>(14:6) and God’s word (17:17). He will guide them unto Jesus, who </p>
<p>communicates God’s word to tell them the way they should go (Isa </p>
<p>30:20–21).</p>
<p>(ii) He will speak whatever he hears from the Father and not on his own </p>
<p>authority or initiative (3:34; 7:17; 8:26, 28; 12:49; 14:10). </p>
<p>(iii) e Spirit will proclaim the things that are to come (16:13b) and will </p>
<p>reiterate what Jesus has already said (16:14b, 15b; cf. 14:26). e Spirit </p>
<p>will declare the events that will happen at the end of this age. “Telling </p>
<p>what is to come” is possible only for the true God and for the coming </p>
