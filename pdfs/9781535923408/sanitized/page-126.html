<p>Existence of Jesus before Abraham</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>shows Jesus as the one who transcends time and space, unlike Abraham, a </p>
<p>human being, who came into existence at a specic time. His armation </p>
<p>resembles Yahweh’s statement about his incomparable status to other gods </p>
<p>(Isa 43:10), implying that Jesus, who pre-existed in oneness with God, is </p>
<p>indeed greater in status and function than any of the patriarchs, including </p>
<p>Abraham (1:15, 27; 3:31; 8:53). </p>
Unfortunately, Jesus’ accusers reject his divine status and treat his
<p>claim as blasphemy (cf. 19:7) that deserves the death penalty by stoning </p>
<p>(Lev 24:11–16; 1 Kgs 21:9, 10, 13). So they take up stones, which could </p>
<p>have been kept at the Gentile court for rebuilding the temple,</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>to throw at</p>
<p>him. is public attempt by “the Jews” to kill Jesus brings him nearer to the </p>
<p>cross. However, since the Father’s time had not yet come, he secretly goes </p>
<p>out of the temple (8:59).</p>
<p>27. Jeremias 1975: 118.</p>
