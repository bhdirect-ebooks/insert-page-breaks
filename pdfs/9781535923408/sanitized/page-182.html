<p>and hence those who are attached with Jesus ask for things that Jesus wills. </p>
<p>e reproduction of Jesus’ character always glories the Father. It projects </p>
<p>them as Jesus’ disciples before those who will see God’s glory in them (15:8). </p>
<p>Honoring God in daily life is possible only by bearing much fruit, that is, by </p>
<p>exhibiting Jesus’ character.</p>
<p>e descriptions of abiding “in me” and “in you” are spoken by Jesus </p>
<p>in parallel with abiding “in his love” (15:9). Jesus loved his own until the </p>
<p>end (13:1), just as the Father loved him. e Father’s love for the Son is </p>
<p>eternal and is the core of their relationship and work (3:35; 5:20; 10:17; </p>
<p>17:24). e same love is the uniting force between Jesus and his followers. </p>
<p>It is Jesus who rst loved his people to show that God is love (cf. 1 John 4:8, </p>
<p>16). He asks them now to remain in the love he has already demonstrated. </p>
<p>Jesus himself kept his Father’s commandments as the mark of abiding in </p>
<p>his love. Similarly, the outward expression of remaining in Jesus’ love for </p>
<p>his disciples is to obey his commandments (15:10; cf. 14:15, 21, 23–24), </p>
<p>which are not burdensome (1 John 5:3). e prerequisite for the disciples’ </p>
<p>fruit-bearing is to keep themselves in the threefold relationship of love and </p>
<p>obedience. e purpose of what Jesus spoke in 15:1–10 was that his joy </p>
<p>may be within his pupils. Abiding in Jesus, in his words and in his love, will </p>
<p>result in experiencing Jesus’ joy in all its fullness (15:11). Jesus’ complete </p>
<p>joy takes away worldly sorrows and brings peace in the midst of troubles</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(cf. 17:13).</p>
<p>Jesus now reminds of his commandment that his people should love </p>
<p>one another in the same pattern as he has (15:12). Jesus explains the great-</p>
est degree of divine love as laying down one’s life for friends (15:13). “Lay-
<p>ing down one’s life” refers to voluntary self-sacrice for the welfare of others </p>
<p>(10:11, 15, 17–18). us, self-sacrice is the highest form of love that one </p>
<p>can show. en Jesus says to his followers, “You are my friends,” (15:14) </p>
<p>instead of “servants” (15:15). In the OT, God identies Abraham as “my </p>
<p>friend” (Isa 41:8; 2 Chr 20:7; Jas 2:23; cf. Exod 33:11 for Moses) to con-</p>
<p>vey his intimate relationship and revelation of secrets to him (Gen 18:17). </p>
<p>Similarly, a king’s friends were nobles who were closely associated with him </p>
<p>in taking royal decisions (1 Esd 8:11, 13, 26; 3 Macc 5:19, 26, 29, 34, 44).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By calling his own “my friends,” Jesus attests his ownership and intimate </p>
<p>relationship with them, to whom he revealed all he heard from the Father </p>
<p>(8:26, 28b; 12:49).</p>
<p>7. Cf. Lincoln 2006: 405.</p>
