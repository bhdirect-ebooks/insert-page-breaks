<p>e Pharisees’ Investigation on the Healing</p>

<p>who were cast out of the synagogue because of their faith in Jesus as the </p>
<p>Christ aer 70 CE.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>e word “already” seems to indicate that the excommunication that </p>
<p>was ocially enforced in the late rst century is already seen in the Jew-</p>
<p>ish rejection of Jesus and his followers in Jesus’ time. e two temporal </p>
<p>perspectives—the pre-resurrection life of Jesus and the post-resurrection </p>
<p>perspective of the evangelist—are telescoped together in the telling of the </p>
<p>story.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Actually, John brings the believers’ excommunication back to Jesus’</p>
<p>time, just as he brings Jesus’ glorication back to the cross or even earlier to </p>
<p>the incarnation. He sees the reality of Jesus’ crucixion happening already </p>
<p>in the early attempts of his opponents to arrest and kill Jesus (7:1, 19, 25, </p>
<p>30, 32, 45; 8:20, 40, 59; 8:44; 11:57). Similarly, he brings backward the gi </p>
<p>of the Holy Spirit to the day of resurrection (20:19–23). Since John nds it </p>
<p>dicult to separate the events of salvation in time, he does not stress the </p>
<p>chronology of the saving events as much as he does the events themselves. </p>
<p>For him God’s salvic events together constitute one compound event.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>persecution inicted upon Christians in Jesus’ time anticipates the suer-</p>
<p>ings that God’s new community will undergo in the world at all times (cf. </p>
<p>16:2).</p>
<p>In 9:24 the scene changes to the conicting dialogue between the </p>
<p>healed man and the authorities. e Pharisees called him a second time </p>
<p>and insisted that he give glory to God, probably by worshipping him alone </p>
<p>(cf. 1 Chr 16:28–29) and by denying that Jesus is the Messiah. Since they </p>
<p>were convinced that the man received his sight through Jesus, they labeled </p>
<p>Jesus contemptuously as “this man” who is a sinner. is may mean either </p>
<p>that Jesus is, like any other human, liable to sin or that since Jesus healed on </p>
<p>the Sabbath he is a sinner. </p>
<p>ere is a play on the word “to know” in 9:25. e Pharisees arm, </p>
<p>“We know that this man is a sinner,” but they do not know that only by </p>
<p>giving glory to Jesus can one bring glory to God (5:23). e healed man </p>
<p>also speaks of what he knows and what he does not know: he does not </p>
<p>know whether Jesus is a sinner or not in the pharisaic standard, but he </p>
<p>knows that his darkness was transformed by Jesus into light and that he, </p>
<p>who was blind, can now see. When they see the man’s admiration for Jesus, </p>
<p>“the Jews” ask him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?” </p>
