<p>Jesus’ Reign from the Cross</p>
<p>186</p>
<p>e absolute statement “ere they crucied him” (19:18a) and the </p>
<p>mention of the place of crucixion as near to the city of Jerusalem (John </p>
<p>19:20; Heb 13:13) have historical signicance, for the whole episode speci-</p>
<p>es the place, time, and the rulers of the day. Two others, one on either </p>
<p>side, were crucied with him. ey were bandits (Matt 27:38; Mark 15:27) </p>
<p>and criminals (Luke 23:33). Jesus was exalted on the cross between them </p>
<p>(19:18b) in order to identify himself with the criminals in fulllment of the </p>
<p>OT prophecy (cf. Isa 53:12; Ps 22:16; Luke 22:37). As the Lamb that bears </p>
<p>human sins, Jesus was sacriced on the cross (John 1:29, 36; Isa 53:4–7). Je-</p>
<p>sus thus revealed God’s love supremely on the cross. Paul interpreted Jesus’ </p>
<p>crucixion in terms of crucixion of human selshness along with Jesus so </p>
<p>that the glorious self may be raised with him (Rom 6:2–11; Gal 2:20).</p>
<p>at Jesus is the King who reigns from the cross is conrmed by the </p>
<p>title “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews,” written and set up on the </p>
<p>cross by Pilate (19:19). “Jesus of Nazareth” refers to the man Jesus who lived </p>
<p>in Nazareth. at this humiliated man is the King of the Jews puts Jesus </p>
<p>on the highest side of the social spectrum. is paradox can be grasped </p>
<p>only by those who see the reality of the cross and believe! Many of the Jew-</p>
<p>ish people could read this title, as it was written in three major languages </p>
<p>(Hebrew, Latin, and Greek; 19:20), symbolizing that Jesus was exalted on </p>
<p>the cross as the King of the people of all languages.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>e title set up on</p>
<p>Jesus’ cross reects Pilate’s nal verdict, although he would not have per-</p>
<p>ceived that Jesus is the King who, paradoxically, reigns from the cross. e </p>
<p>chief priests, among “the Jews,” were intrigued by the writing of Pilate. ey </p>
<p>urged him to rewrite it, accusing that “this man” Jesus claimed himself to </p>
<p>be the King of the Jews (19:21). eir attempt was foiled by Pilate’s rm </p>
<p>statement, “What I have written, I have written” (19:22), implying that the </p>
<p>verdict cannot be changed by inducement.</p>
<p>When the soldiers had crucied Jesus, they took his outer garments </p>
<p>and tore them into four pieces to share among themselves, one for each, </p>
<p>as per Roman law. is shows that four soldiers were assigned for Jesus. </p>
<p>ey removed Jesus’ undergarment, a long tunic worn next to the skin.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> </p>
<p>is tunic was seamless, woven into one piece from top to bottom (19:23) </p>
<p>and so they could not tear it into four parts, but, as per the Roman military </p>
<p>custom, they cast lots to decide who should take it (19:24a). John sees both </p>
<p>acts of the soldiers as fulllment of the Scripture (Ps 22:18). In fact, he </p>
<p>12. e three languages suggest the universality of Jesus’ reign; Keener 2005: 2.1137.</p>
