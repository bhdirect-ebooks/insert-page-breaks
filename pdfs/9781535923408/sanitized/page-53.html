<p>John 2:13–22</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>e narrator comments that Jesus’ disciples remembered what is </p>
<p>written in the Scripture, “e zeal for your house will consume me” (John </p>
<p>2:17; cf. Ps 69:9). ey realized that Jesus’ vehement action to preserve the </p>
<p>purication of the house of the Lord was due to his consuming zeal for the </p>
<p>Father’s house (cf. Luke 2:49). Psalm 69 actually speaks of the suering of </p>
<p>a righteous one and it was used by rst-century Christians to proclaim the </p>
<p>suering and death of Jesus (cf. Ps 69:21 with Matt 27:34, 48; Luke 23:36; </p>
<p>John 19:30; Rom 11:9–10). Jesus’ words “will consume me” anticipate his </p>
<p>suering and death in order to build a new temple, that is, a community </p>
<p>with a new life to worship the Father in spirit and in truth (4:23–24). </p>
<p>at Jesus spoke of his death is further conrmed by 2:19, where he </p>
<p>asks “the Jews” to destroy “this temple,”</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>his body, with a challenge that he</p>
<p>will raise it up in three days (cf. Matt 26:61; 27:40; Mark 14:58; 15:29). He </p>
<p>spoke in response to the Jerusalem authorities, who asked for a sign from </p>
<p>him to prove that he had authority from God to disrupt the cultic worship </p>
<p>by chasing out the animals kept for sacrice (2:18). In 2:19 Jesus speaks of </p>
<p>his death and resurrection in terms of destroying the old temple with all its </p>
<p>legal system of animal sacrices and building a new temple to be a place of </p>
<p>life-giving power. In this sense, 2:17–22 foreshadows the death and resur-</p>
<p>rection of Christ,</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> a “sign” to be seen by his adversaries.</p>
<p>Jesus’ cleansing of the temple, as a whole, is a prophetic and symbolic </p>
<p>act that points to the “greater reality” that is coming (e.g., Isa 8:16–18; Ezek </p>
<p>4:1–3). It is also Jesus’ non-miraculous sign that anticipates his sacrice on </p>
<p>the cross (cf. Matt 12:39–40). John’s addition of “sheep and oxen” that were </p>
<p>driven out of the temple is to symbolize that Jesus removes the need for </p>
<p>animal sacrices to obtain forgiveness of sins and deliverance. e Jerusa-</p>
<p>lem temple is now replaced by a new Temple, Jesus, in whom the oering </p>
<p>of animals has no place (cf. 2:19). Jesus himself is the sacrice to remove </p>
<p>human sin and he is the one who oers it (e.g., Heb 9:11–14). His life and </p>
<p>work thus mark the end of the temple worship and the beginning of a new </p>
<p>and life-giving worship. e action of Jesus in the temple is not merely that </p>
<p>of a Jewish reformer or merely a protest against the irreverence and cor-</p>
<p>ruption of Jewish worship, but is a sign to convey the truth that the end of </p>
<p>13. e Greek word naos, used here and in 2:20, represents the whole temple and not </p>
<p>the sanctuary alone.</p>
