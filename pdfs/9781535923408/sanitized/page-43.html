<p>John 1:35–51</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>testimony, which enabled his disciples nally to accept Jesus as the Christ. </p>
<p>In John’s Gospel, a genuine “seeing” of Jesus is oen preceded by “hearing” </p>
<p>about Jesus and followed by “believing” and “witnessing.”</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>Jesus, on seeing</p>
<p>the two walking behind him, questioned them, “What are you seeking?” </p>
<p>(1:38). On the surface, Jesus’ question asks what they really want from him, </p>
<p>but at a deeper level it means whether they are seeking the life that quench </p>
<p>their spiritual thirst.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>e two disciples, instead of answering the question directly, asked Je-</p>
<p>sus, “Rabbi, where are you staying?” e question shows that the two want-</p>
<p>ed to know Jesus more and have intimate friendship with him. e Greek </p>
<p>word used for “staying” (menein) in John denotes intimacy with Jesus. e </p>
<p>knowledge they had gained through the Baptist that Jesus is the Lamb of </p>
<p>God, who takes away human sin and who empowers believers with the </p>
<p>Holy Spirit, could have created a spiritual longing within them. erefore </p>
<p>they wanted to remain with him and learn from him the Law, which was </p>
<p>normally taught by Jewish rabbis even until late at night.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>is explains</p>
<p>why they called him “Rabbi,” which means “my great one” or “teacher.”</p>
<p>Jesus’ answer, “Come and you will see,” invites the seekers not only to </p>
<p>come and stay with him but also to perceive him as the Messiah to whom </p>
<p>the OT points (cf. John 6:37; Matt 11:28). Responding to Jesus’ invita-</p>
<p>tion, the two disciples went with him. e time of their stay with Jesus is </p>
<p>specied as the “tenth hour,” which, as per Jewish reckoning, would be 4:00 </p>
<p>p.m. Does it denote the time when the disciples came to Jesus or the time </p>
<p>when they le him? e statement “they stayed with him that day” (1:39b) </p>
<p>implies that the two stayed with Jesus until 4.00 p.m. If the disciples’ stay </p>
<p>had fallen on a Friday, as Brown has calculated,</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>then the followers would</p>
<p>have le Jesus before the Sabbath started, at 6.00 p.m.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>In his dialogue with</p>
<p>them throughout the day, Jesus convinced them through the Scriptures that </p>
<p>he is the Messiah (cf. John 1:41, 45; Luke 24:25–27, 32). e disciples got </p>
<p>new revelation about God and the Messiah, which marked a turning point </p>
<p>in their lives.</p>

<p>37. e reference to the precise time or day occurs oen in John (e.g., 3:2; 4:6; 18:28; </p>
<p>19:39, 42; 20:1, 19), showing that the narrated events happened in history at a particular </p>
<p>point of time.</p>
