<p>JOHN 18</p>
<p>Arrest and Trials Faced by Jesus</p>
<p>Jesus’ passion and resurrection (18:1—20:31)</p>
<p>John 18:1—20:31 constitutes one unit, since it witnesses to the conjoined </p>
<p>events of Jesus’ passion and resurrection. However, two full chapters </p>
<p>(18:1—19:42) are devoted to the passion narrative.</p>
<p>The betrayal of Jesus (18:1–11)</p>
<p>Aer Jesus’ Pastoral Speech and Prayer, he went out with his disciples </p>
<p>across Kidron valley, a brook situated in the east of Jerusalem. ey entered </p>
<p>into the garden (18:1), the garden of Gethsemane, meaning “oil press,” situ-</p>
<p>ated on the Mount of Olives (Matt 26:30, 36 par.). is was the usual place </p>
<p>where Jesus met with the Twelve especially for prayer (Matt 26:36 par.) and </p>
<p>therefore Judas had known this place (18:2). As it was a place away from the </p>
<p>crowd, it was easier for him to betray Jesus and for the cohort</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>and ocers</p>
<p>from the chief priests and the Pharisees to arrest Jesus without any tumult </p>
<p>among people (18:3). Jesus had a large following and therefore it is possible </p>
<p>that Pilate had put a cohort of Roman soldiers at the disposal of Jewish </p>
<p>authorities for security reasons.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>“e Jews” must have used the Romans</p>
<p>and Jewish ocials (the “temple police”) so that they could easily bring </p>
<p>political charge against Jesus.</p>
<p>Judas was leading the squad of Roman cohort and the temple guards </p>
<p>to seize Jesus. ey came with lanterns, torches, and weapons (18:3) and </p>
<p>thus treated Jesus as a robber (Matt 26:55 par.; cf. Isa 53:12). is shows </p>
<p>that Judas’ betrayal took place at night (cf. 1 Cor 11:23) when they could </p>
<p>arrest Jesus easily without public riot. Jesus, in his foreknowledge, knew all </p>
<p>1. A “cohort” (Greek speira) is the tenth part of a legion, normally with six hundred </p>
<p>Roman soldiers with a commander, though the number varied.</p>
