<p>Coming of the Greeks to Jesus</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>man” of Dan 7:13–14 as the Christ-like gure who, with full of honor and </p>
<p>glory, will establish the eternal kingdom. Possibly, the crowd was familiar </p>
<p>with these traditions and thought that Jesus must be wrong in saying that </p>
<p>the Son of Man must die. Jesus did not answer directly to the question, </p>
<p>“Who is this Son of Man?” However, he implicitly said that the Son of Man </p>
<p>is the messianic King who will establish his rule by being lied up on the </p>
<p>cross, followed by his resurrection.</p>
<p>On several occasions, Jesus has said that he, the Light, will be in the </p>
<p>world for a little longer before he goes to the Father (7:33; 9:4–5; 11:9–10). </p>
<p>He reiterates the same in 12:35 by indicating the nearness of his departure </p>
<p>and urges the crowd to walk in the Light while they still have it with them. </p>
<p>at is, people should live by believing in the Light (12:36) and conse-</p>
<p>quently by doing good works (3:19–21; 9:4–5). Otherwise, the power of </p>
<p>darkness will dominate them making them to do wickedness (3:20; 12:46) </p>
<p>and lose their vision. Humankind, in this world of dualism, should choose </p>
<p>one way of life, either walking in the darkness or believing in the Light so </p>
<p>that they might become children of light (1:4–5, 9–12).</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>With these words,</p>
<p>Jesus departs and hides himself from the people, probably to prepare him-</p>
<p>self for death.</p>
<p>Unbelief and judgment (12:37–50) </p>
<p>Jesus did many signs in Jerusalem so that people might see his glory and </p>
<p>believe in him. However, even aer seeing the signs they did not believe </p>
<p>in him (12:37). For John even unbelief is within God’s plan of salvation, </p>
<p>fullling the prophet’s saying in Isa 53:1 LXX (12:38; cf. Rom 10:16). Isaiah </p>
<p>was frustrated to see people not believing his message, although the mighty </p>
<p>works of God (“the arm of the Lord”) were revealed. So John cites Isaiah’s </p>
<p>prophecy (Isa 6:10) again to give reason for the unbelief of Jesus’ audience. </p>
<p>ey could not believe, because God blinded their eyes and hardened their </p>
<p>heart lest they could see with their eyes and understand in their heart, and </p>
<p>turn to God for healing (12:39–40).</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> ere is no reference to God’s predes-</p>
<p>tination to cause some to understand his message and believe and others </p>
<p>not. At all times, including the time of Isaiah, some hear God’s words and </p>
<p>17. e Qumran community identied itself as the children of light and all others as </p>
<p>children of darkness (1QM 1.11–16; 1QS 1.9–10; 3.13–26).</p>
<p>18. e quotation in 12:40 may follow the Aramaic text, or the Hebrew text quoted </p>
<p>from memory, or an ancient Greek translation of Isaiah; Kanagaraj 2005: 414–15.</p>
