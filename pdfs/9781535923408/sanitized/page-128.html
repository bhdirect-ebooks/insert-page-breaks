<p>Recovery of Sight for a Blind Man</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>dark hours (9:4). is is conrmed by Jesus’ statement, “As long as I am in </p>
<p>the world, I am the Light of the world” (9:5; cf. 8:12; 12:35–36). us, Jesus </p>
<p>thrusts the urgency to illuminate the world by bringing holistic healing to </p>
<p>the suering humanity.</p>
<p>Jesus spat on the ground, made clay out of the spittle, anointed the </p>
<p>man’s eyes with the clay, and sent him to the pool of Siloam to wash himself. </p>
<p>e man followed Jesus’ instruction fully and came back to him aer re-</p>
<p>gaining his physical sight (9:6–7)! John does not attach any magical power </p>
<p>to the spittle, though saliva was regarded later by some rabbis as containing </p>
<p>healing properties (b. B. Bat. 126b),</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>and so also was the water of Siloam.</p>
<p>e healing took place only when the blind man washed his eyes in the </p>
<p>pool of Siloam, and this shows the man’s complete trust in Jesus and obedi-</p>
<p>ence to his instruction. e narrator gives the meaning of “Siloam” as “sent </p>
<p>one” (9:7), pointing to Jesus, who was sent by God, as the source of healing. </p>
<p>John deliberately connects Jesus with the pool of Siloam, from where water </p>
<p>was drawn for the purifying ceremony at the feast of Tabernacles, to reveal </p>
<p>him as the one who replaces the water in Siloam with his power to bring </p>
<p>wholeness to human life.</p>
<p>e neighbors, who had seen him blind and begging, were astonished </p>
<p>at his healing (9:8). While some were certain that the healed man was the </p>
<p>one who had been sitting and begging, others hesitantly said that he looked </p>
<p>like the blind beggar (9:9). However, the man conrmed his identity by tell-</p>
<p>ing that he was the same man who had been sitting and begging. John puts </p>
<p>the phrase “I, I am [he]” in the mouth of the healed man this time to reveal </p>
his social identity, but without any divine signicance. On people’s further
<p>enquiry about his healing (9:10), the man witnessed about Jesus and the </p>
<p>manner in which he healed him. He had understood Jesus only as a man </p>
<p>(9:11), but was not aware of his whereabouts (9:12; cf. 5:11–13).</p>
<p>The Pharisees’ investigation on the healing (9:13–34)</p>
<p>Unlike the healed paralytic who went to “the Jews” to identify Jesus as the </p>
<p>healer (5:15), the man born blind was brought by his neighbors to the Phari-</p>
<p>sees to narrate the healing story (9:13), for it was on the Sabbath when Jesus </p>
<p>opened the man’s eyes (9:14). e Pharisees asked the man how he received </p>
<p>his sight and the man testied, “He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and </p>
<p>I see” (9:15). e rabbis forbade both washing and mixing or kneading of </p>
