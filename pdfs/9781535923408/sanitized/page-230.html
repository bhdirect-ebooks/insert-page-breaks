<p>Jesus’ Appearances to the Male Disciples</p>
<p>202</p>
<p>omas had told the other disciples (cf. 20:25). By using the same words </p>
<p>that omas had used, Jesus invited him to put his nger “here,” implying </p>
<p>Jesus’ hands and side, and to see by a touch of the wounds in his forearms </p>
<p>and also on his pierced side. So saying, Jesus admonished omas not to be </p>
<p>an unbelieving disciple, but a believing one (20:27). It is not known wheth-</p>
<p>er omas put out his hand and touched Jesus’ wounds. Instead, the sight </p>
<p>of Jesus’ wounded hands and pierced side and his gentle rebuke touched </p>
<p>and convicted omas to believe not only in Jesus’ resurrection, but also in </p>
<p>Jesus’ person. He responded with a fresh understanding about Jesus with </p>
<p>the emotionally charged words, “My Lord and my God!” (20:28). </p>
<p>“Lord” is God’s name (Exod 6:2–3, 6, 7; Isa 42:8), a name above every </p>
<p>name that had been given to Jesus during his earthly ministry (17:11–12). </p>
<p>omas, as representative of the rst Christians, could perceive, in Jesus’ </p>
<p>resurrection the God of the OT who spoke and acted in Jesus. He was </p>
<p>transformed by a vision of Jesus to see the one true God, the Lord, in Jesus </p>
<p>(14:9–10). erefore he did not hesitate to confess Jesus as Lord and God </p>
<p>for him (cf. Ps 35:23). e twice-repeated possessive pronoun “my” unveils </p>
<p>that Jesus is God and Lord not only for omas but for any person who </p>
<p>believes in Jesus. erefore the rst-century Christians ascribed to Jesus, </p>
<p>without hesitation, the honor and worship due to God alone. e invoca-</p>
<p>tion “my Lord and my God” may also be a Christian polemic against both </p>
<p>the late rst-century Eastern cults, which used these titles together, and </p>
<p>Emperor Domitian (90–100 CE), who called himself “Lord God.” Coun-</p>
<p>teracting to their claim, John contends that Jesus alone is Lord and God.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>When Jesus came to his disciples once more for setting omas on </p>
<p>faith, he put before him the thought-provoking question, “Have you be-</p>
<p>lieved because you have seen me?” en Jesus arms, by keeping the wider </p>
<p>community of future believers in mind (cf. 17:20), “Blessed are those who </p>
<p>did not see [me] and yet believe” (20:29). omas, without listening to the </p>
<p>words of his comrades who had seen the risen Lord, wanted to believe aer </p>
<p>himself seeing Jesus. ough omas is reasonable, his pathway to faith </p>
<p>is far less to be appreciated. Jesus pronounces a blessing upon those who </p>
<p>would not see the risen Jesus but would still believe. With this beatitude, </p>
<p>Jesus foresaw that the new covenant community, which he established and </p>
<p>empowered, would grow by the worldwide mission of God done through </p>
<p>the eyewitnesses. </p>
