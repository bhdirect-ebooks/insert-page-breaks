<p>e Roman Trial, Part 1</p>
<p>178</p>
<p>The Roman trial, part 1 (18:28–40) </p>
<p>By leaving Jesus’ trial before Caiaphas abruptly, now John narrates Jesus’ </p>
<p>trial before Pilate, the Roman governor. Jesus was led from Caiaphas to the </p>
<p>praetorium, the ocial residence of the Roman governor of Judea both in </p>
<p>Caesarea (Acts 23:33–36) and in Jerusalem (18:28a). It was a large build-</p>
<p>ing in Jerusalem with an outside courtyard where the Jewish crowd could </p>
<p>assemble. e specication “It was early” is attested by the crowing of the </p>
<p>rooster, probably at 6:00 a.m., when Pilate would attend to the judicial busi-</p>
<p>ness of the day.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>“e Jews,” who joined the crowd to accuse Jesus before</p>
<p>Pilate, did not enter the praetorium (18:28b–29). e Passover was to begin </p>
<p>at 6:00 p.m. and “the Jews” would keep themselves pure before they ate the </p>
<p>Passover by not entering the praetorium, a Gentile dwelling, which they </p>
<p>considered an unclean place. eir act of staying outside the praetorium </p>
<p>governs seven scenes that take place outside (18:29–32, 38b-40; 19:4–8, </p>
<p>12–16) and inside the praetorium (18:33–38a; 19:1–3, 9–11).</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the rst scene, Pilate came out to “the Jews” to enquire them, as </p>
<p>per Roman law, of the nature of their accusation against Jesus (18:29; cf. </p>
<p>Mark 15:14). Without specifying any charge, they told contemptuously that </p>
<p>if “this man” was not doing evil, they would not have handed him over to </p>
<p>Pilate (18:30). ey expected Pilate to declare Jesus a criminal. However, </p>
<p>Pilate realized that the charge of “the Jews” was pertaining to Jewish law </p>
<p>and therefore he sought to dismiss the case by asking, “You take him and </p>
<p>judge him according to your law.” But the accusers responded saying, “It is </p>
<p>not lawful for us to put anyone to death” (18:31). is shows that “the Jews” </p>
<p>brought Jesus to Pilate just to get his approval to put Jesus to death.</p>
<p>ere is little evidence that the Jewish council had legal authority to </p>
<p>put the oenders to death between 6 CE and 70 CE. Even in the case of </p>
<p>adultery, which deserved death by stoning, the decision needed to be rati-</p>
<p>ed later by the governor.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>us, “the Jews” correctly said that “it is not</p>
<p>lawful” for them to put anyone to death. Although it was “the Jews” who </p>
<p>were responsible to kill Jesus, it was Jesus who was in control of the whole </p>
<p>proceedings. His death by crucixion was the fulllment of what he himself </p>
<p>had already predicted (18:32; cf. 12:32–33).</p>
