<p>e Roman Trial, Part 2</p>
<p>184</p>
<p>who delivered” is a collective singular referring to all Jewish opponents, in-</p>
<p>cluding Judas, who are under greater punishment for delivering Jesus to be </p>
<p>crucied.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Upon Jesus’ reference to his origin as from God and to the nal</p>
<p>punishment on those who delivered him, Pilate becomes so fearful that he </p>
<p>seeks to release Jesus (19:12a). Pilate’s persuasion to release Jesus obviously </p>
<p>takes place outside as the seventh and last scene in the Roman trial.</p>
<p>Without allowing Pilate to release Jesus, “the Jews” caution Pilate, say-</p>
<p>ing, “If you release this man, you are not Caesar’s friend; everyone who </p>
<p>makes himself a king opposes Caesar” (19:12b). “Friend of Caesar” could </p>
<p>be an ocial honor conferred on Pilate as one of the trusted associates from </p>
<p>whom the Roman emperors drew advice</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>(cf. 1 Macc 2:18; 3:38; 6:14; 3</p>
<p>Macc 5:3, 19, 26, 29, 34, 44 for “friends of the king”). “e Jews” argue that </p>
<p>if Pilate would show favor to someone who makes himself a king, then it </p>
<p>amounts to treason, which may cause Pilate to lose the honor “friend of </p>
<p>Caesar” and even suer execution. On hearing this, Pilate brought Jesus </p>
<p>out and sat him down on the judgment seat at a place called “the Pavement” </p>
<p>(Hebrew Gabbatha; 19:13). e Greek term bēma means “stone pavement,” </p>
<p>and in Aramaic it means a “high place,” with steps leading up, situated in </p>
<p>the forecourt of the governor’s palace. </p>
<p>e Greek word ekathisen (19:13) can be taken either transitively (Pi-</p>
<p>late made Jesus to sit on the judgment seat) or intransitively (Pilate sat on </p>
<p>the judgment seat). While in Matt 27:19 it is Pilate who sat down, John </p>
<p>uses the active voice instead of Matthew’s middle voice. e verb, if tran-</p>
<p>sitively understood, gives good sequence to Pilate’s act of leading Jesus. It </p>
<p>is highly possible, then, that he made Jesus sit on the judgment seat, not </p>
<p>to mock at him, but to make a nal attempt to exhibit Jesus as the King of </p>
<p>the Jews, ironically as a suering Man and as the judge of all humans (5:22, </p>
<p>27). is interpretation gives good sense to Pilate’s statement “Behold your </p>
<p>King!” (19:14b) and to the cry of “the Jews” to li up Jesus (apparently </p>
<p>from the judgment seat) and crucify him (19:15).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>e theological motif is</p>
<p>that by bringing Jesus to be judged “the Jews” were passing judgment upon </p>
<p>themselves.</p>
<p>Pilate’s demonstration of Jesus as King is at the sixth hour (noon) </p>
<p>on the day of preparation of the Passover (Nisan 14, ursday; 19:14a). </p>
