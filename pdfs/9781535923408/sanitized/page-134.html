<p>JOHN 10</p>
<p>The Impact of Jesus on His Community </p>
<p>and on Others</p>
<p>Jesus, the self-giving shepherd (10:1–21) </p>
<p>Scholars treat 10:1–21 as a unied sequence with John 9, as Jesus has the </p>
<p>same audience with a similar confrontation.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Jesus declares himself the</p>
<p>good shepherd, who truly cares for his people to the extent of sacricing </p>
<p>himself for them, in contrast to the Pharisees, the false shepherds, who cast </p>
<p>people away (cf. 9:34). Jesus’ discourse in 10:1–18 is a gurative speech or </p>
<p>a parable (10:6) on the shepherd-sheep relationship. He took this parable </p>
<p>from the life-situation in Palestine. </p>
<p>At rst, there is a picture of a sheepfold, the place to house the sheep, </p>
<p>with a door to enter. In the Palestinian context, the door is for the shepherd </p>
<p>to enter in to take care of the sheep and lead them out and in. Anyone </p>
<p>who climbs up and enters the sheepfold is a thief and robber (10:1). By this </p>
<p>imagery, Jesus reproves the Pharisees who did not care for the man who </p>
<p>received his sight, but who tried to take away his faith. ey would not </p>
<p>enter by the door, who is Jesus himself (10:7, 9), but used wrong methods </p>
<p>to steal the healed man who now belongs to Jesus’ ock. Moreover, they </p>
<p>expelled him out of Jewish society without care for his welfare. Such leaders </p>
<p>are condemned by Yahweh himself (Ezek 34:1–10) and Jesus calls them </p>
<p>“thieves and robbers” (10:1, 8), “strangers” (10:5) and “hirelings” (10:12).</p>
<p>In contrast, the shepherd of the sheep enters the fold through the </p>
<p>door, the proper way to get access to the sheep (10:2). e shepherd men-</p>
<p>tioned is Jesus (10:11, 14) and the sheep are the members of the community </p>
<p>he founded. Obviously the door of the sheepfold is kept locked to protect </p>
<p>the sheep from false shepherds. e gatekeeper, who guards the entry to </p>
<p>the sheepfold, opens the door to the true shepherd. e sheep can easily </p>
