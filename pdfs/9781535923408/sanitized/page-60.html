<p>Jesus’ Testimony before Nicodemus</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>treating Nicodemus as the one among the Jewish authorities who rejected </p>
<p>the church’s testimony to Jesus. First, the sharp conict between Jesus’ com-</p>
<p>munity, which was testifying to Jesus, and the synagogue authorities, who </p>
<p>did not accept their testimony, in the late rst century was the re-enactment </p>
<p>of the rejection of Jesus’ testimony by the same authorities in his lifetime. </p>
<p>Secondly, Jesus’ armation betrays the dualistic tendency of the Gospel </p>
to divide people into two opposing groups: insiders (those who believe in
<p>Jesus) and outsiders (those who do not accept Jesus). </p>
<p>Jesus rebukes the unbelieving authorities by questioning how they </p>
<p>can understand and believe in him if he speaks of heavenly things directly, </p>
<p>while they do not understand his message of God’s kingdom spoken in </p>
<p>earthly terms such as rebirth and wind (3:12). Aer this question, Nicode-</p>
<p>mus disappears from the scene until 7:45–52 and 19:38–42. However, the </p>
subjects of Jesus’ dialogue, such as believing, experiencing divine life, and
<p>a heaven-earth dualism, link 3:1–12 with 3:13–21, and therefore it seems </p>
<p>more probable that 3:13–21 is a part of Jesus’ discourse to Nicodemus.</p>
<p>Jesus’ monologue (3:13–21) </p>
<p>Jesus now teaches, “No one has ascended to heaven except the one who </p>
<p>descended from heaven, the Son of Man” (3:13).</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>e statement that no</p>
<p>human has ascended to heaven seems to be a polemic against the claims of </p>
<p>some Jews, including some rabbis, that they had ascended to heaven and </p>
<p>had seen God’s glory. However, the emphasis lies on the descent of the Son </p>
<p>of Man, Jesus. e Son of Man was pre-existent with God in heaven before </p>
<p>he descended by incarnation to earth (John 3:13; cf. Eph 4:9–10) with a </p>
<p>mission of revealing God in his glory and to give heavenly life to all who </p>
<p>believe in him (cf. John 1:50–51; 3:31; 6:32, 38, 42, 46, 50–51, 58, 62; 8:23; </p>
<p>9:33). At the time when John’s Gospel was written, the “Son of Man” was </p>
<p>understood as a heavenly gure, the “Elect One” or Christ (see comment on </p>
<p>1:51 for a study on “the Son of Man”).</p>
However, Jesus speaks of the divine necessity for the Son of Man to be
<p>lied up (3:14). e verb “lied up” (hupsaō) in John has a double meaning: </p>
<p>to be exalted and to be gloried (cf. Isa 52:13 LXX). e verb is connected </p>
<p>to the Servant’s glorication through his vicarious suering and death (Isa </p>
<p>4. Some manuscripts add “[the Son of Man] who is in heaven,” and other manu-</p>
<p>scripts add “[the Son of Man] who is from heaven.” ese additions were made perhaps </p>
<p>to explain the pre-existence of the Son of Man.</p>
