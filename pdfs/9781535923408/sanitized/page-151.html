<p>JOHN 12</p>
<p>The Final Journey of Jesus to Jerusalem</p>
<p>Mary’s anointing of Jesus (12:1–11)</p>
<p>Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany where he had raised </p>
<p>Lazarus from the dead (12:1). John 12 thus provides continuity to John 11 </p>
<p>and echoes the Synoptic tradition on Jesus’ stay in Bethany in his last days </p>
<p>on earth (Matt 21:17; Mark 11:12). ere they made for him a “dinner,” </p>
<p>an evening meal. e hosts were Lazarus and his sisters. Martha was serv-</p>
<p>ing and Mary anointed Jesus’ feet, while Lazarus was reclining with Jesus </p>
<p>(12:2–3a). e feast could have been an occasion to mark their love and </p>
<p>gratitude to Jesus. Mary took a pound of costly ointment produced from </p>
<p>the roots of the spikenard plant (pure nard),</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>anointed the feet of Jesus, and</p>
<p>wiped his feet with her hair (cf. 11:2). A litra of ointment, in Roman mea-</p>
<p>surement, was 12 ounces</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> or 326 grams,</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>costing about 300 denarii (12:5),</p>
<p>the unit of a day’s earnings for a laborer. is means that the ointment had </p>
<p>been prepared from a large quantity of the aromatic plant. </p>
<p>Anointing the feet of guests was not a common Jewish custom during </p>
<p>the meal. Other Gospels speak of a woman who anointed Jesus’ head two </p>
<p>days before the Passover at Bethany (Matt 26:6–13; Mark 14:3–9) and of </p>
<p>another woman who wet Jesus’ feet with her tears and wiped them with her </p>
<p>hair (Luke 7:36–50). John seems to fuse both these traditions, identifying </p>
<p>the woman as Mary of Bethany, and focuses on Jesus’ feet rather than his </p>
<p>head. </p>
<p>She wiped the ointment she had poured on Jesus’ feet with her hair </p>
<p>rather than with any of her clothes. is too was not a normal Jewish cus-</p>
<p>tom. A woman unbinding her hair in public was considered a sign of loose </p>
<p>1. is nard may be an extract from an aromatic Nepalese plant, Nardostachys jata-</p>
