<p>Jewish Rejection of Jesus Intensied</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>Jewish rejection of Jesus intensified (10:22–42) </p>
<p>Now John moves on to narrate Jesus’ conict with his Jewish accusers in </p>
<p>Jerusalem, this time at the feast of the Dedication, which was celebrated </p>
<p>within three months aer the feast of Tabernacles. By openly attacking “the </p>
<p>Jews” that they are not his sheep because of their unbelief, Jesus assures </p>
<p>once more of his love for “my sheep” and that he will give them eternal </p>
<p>life and protect them from anyone who would snatch them away from the </p>
<p>Father’s hand (10:26–29). e point of contention, however, is on Jesus’ </p>
<p>identity.</p>
<p>Is Jesus the Christ? (10:22–31) </p>
<p>e feast of the Dedication (Hanukkah), a festival called “Lights” (Ant. </p>
<p>12.7.7), was celebrated in Jerusalem (10:22) during winter, commemo-</p>
<p>rating the cleansing of the temple and relighting of the altar re by Judas </p>
<p>Maccabaeus in 164 BCE, three years to the day aer the desecration by </p>
<p>Antiochus Epiphanes (2 Macc 10:1–9; cf. 1 Macc 1:54). On the day of this </p>
<p>feast Jesus was walking in the temple, in the portico of Solomon (10:23), </p>
<p>which could be the eastern cloister built by King Solomon (J.W. 5.5.1; Ant. </p>
<p>15.11.3; 20.9.7). is was a traditional place for teaching and disputation </p>
<p>(Acts 3:11; 5:12).</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>“e Jews” gathered around Jesus with a hostile intention (cf. Ps </p>
<p>118:10–12) and insisted that he openly confess if he was the Christ (10:24).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jesus had already revealed himself as the shepherd-king who will come in </p>
<p>the line of David. His opponents could not grasp it, but attempted to make </p>
<p>him confess his messiahship plainly so that they might accuse him of blas-</p>
<p>phemy and condemn him to death (cf. Mark 14:61–64). Jesus’ answer, “I </p>
<p>told you, and you do not believe” (10:25a), looks back to all he had taught </p>
<p>thus far. His words were spoken and his works were done with the authority </p>
<p>of God (5:43) and as a witness to himself that he was sent by God (10:25b; </p>
<p>5:36). However, they did not believe. us Jesus implicitly accepts that he </p>
<p>is the Christ and that only those who believe his words and works can per-</p>
<p>ceive this “Messianic Secret.”</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Believing Jesus as the Christ is fundamental</p>

<p>10. ey asked Jesus, “Until how long would you seize our spirit/soul?” (“How long </p>
<p>will you keep us in suspense?” [ESV]), implying a state of anxiety (cf. Ps 25:1 LXX; 86:4 </p>
<p>LXX); von Wahlde 2010: 2.471.</p>
