<p>e ird Revelation of the Risen Jesus</p>
<p>208</p>
<p>there were so many large sh, the net was not torn (21:11). e church fa-</p>
<p>thers gave several symbolic/mystical interpretations to the precise number </p>
<p>153. For Augustine, the total 153 is obtained by adding the numbers from </p>
<p>one to seventeen (1 + 2 + 3 + . . . 17 = 153) and the number 17 is made up </p>
<p>of 10 plus 7, 10 symbolizing the Ten Commandments and 7 the seven gis </p>
<p>of the Spirit. If so, the 153 sh represents the fulllment of the Law through </p>
<p>the Spirit.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>However, the exact number of sh simply bears the stamp of an</p>
<p>eyewitness and historical accuracy (cf. 21:24), because the caught sh used </p>
to be counted to divide them among shermen.
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p>e intention of the author could be much more than that. Since John </p>
<p>21 follows the commissioning of disciples (20:21–22), the dragging of a </p>
<p>large amount of sh, without the net being broken, could be an enacted </p>
<p>parable in which the large catch of sh may symbolize the ingathering of </p>
<p>many new converts from all nations through the disciples’ ministry. e </p>
<p>gospel net will never break, no matter how many converts it catches.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>miraculous catch of sh, then, looks forward to the success of the mission </p>
<p>of God’s new community in the world.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Jesus’ invitation to the disciples to come and have breakfast (21:12) </p>
<p>links with 21:9. is is the breakfast already prepared by Jesus, as Wisdom </p>
<p>did (Prov 9:1–6). e love and care of the good shepherd convinced his </p>
<p>sheep to recognize the man as the risen Lord! erefore they did not dare </p>
<p>to ask, “Who are you?” (21:12). Jesus, as the host, came and took the bread </p>
<p>and gave it to them, and likewise with the sh (John 21:13; cf. 6:11; Luke </p>
<p>24:30). One may quickly nd an allusion here to the church’s Eucharist.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>As</p>
<p>there is no thanksgiving, it may not be a eucharistic meal, but the resurrec-</p>
<p>tion meal in which Jesus serves them (cf. 13:1–20) and unites them as one </p>
<p>with him into God’s family. e serving of bread and sh may symbolize </p>
<p>the source of life that will strengthen Jesus’ disciples to continue his mission </p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> John’s historical accuracy is reected in his numbering of Je-</p>
<p>sus’ appearance at the Sea of Tiberias as the third one aer his resurrection </p>

<p>8. Bruce 1992: 401. is interpretation ts well to the context and also to the proposal </p>
<p>that 153 is the numerical value of the Hebrew benê ’elōhîm, “children of God,” whom the </p>
<p>shers would gather in; Keener 2005: 2.1231, by citing Joseph Romeo.</p>
