<p>JOHN 13</p>
<p>Jesus’ Last Supper with His Disciples</p>
<p>Jesus’ Private Ministry (13:1—17:26)</p>
<p>With John 13, there begins another major section of John’s Gospel, which </p>
<p>contains Jesus’ private ministry to his followers (13:1–17:26). Jesus’ sayings </p>
<p>recorded in this section are meant for the believers to make them stand rm </p>
<p>in faith in the face of trials and aiction in this evil world. Jesus teaches that </p>
<p>the new covenant community needs to overcome evil with love, humble </p>
<p>service, and good works done in union with him (i.e., by bearing fruit). </p>
<p>e members of the community need not be troubled either by the world’s </p>
<p>hatred or over Jesus’ departure, for he will send them the Spirit of truth to </p>
<p>be with them in his absence, to teach them and to guide them unto all truth. </p>
<p>e Spirit will also enable them to love one another within and outside </p>
<p>the community. Indeed, Jesus’ ethical instruction “Love one another” is a </p>
<p>new commandment given to the new community. He also instructs them </p>
<p>to pray to the Father in his name, and he himself prayed to the Father that </p>
<p>his followers might be protected from the evil in the world and that the </p>
<p>church might grow with more believers added through the words preached </p>
<p>by them. Finally, Jesus himself will come to take his followers to the Father’s </p>
<p>house, where they will be with him forever. is section, then, has several </p>
<p>distinctive features of God’s new community!</p>
<p>Washing of the disciples’ feet (13:1–20) </p>
<p>13:1–3 gives the setting for Jesus’ act of washing his disciples’ feet. He had </p>
<p>the Last Supper (13:2, 4) with his disciples one day earlier than the Passover. </p>
<p>In the Synoptic accounts (Mark 14:12; Luke 22:15), Jesus has the Passover </p>
<p>meal with his disciples on the day of Passover (Friday, the 15th of Nisan). </p>
<p>But John sets the meal on the evening that begins the Day of Preparation </p>
<p>(ursday, the 14th of Nisan), on which Jesus was betrayed and crucied </p>
