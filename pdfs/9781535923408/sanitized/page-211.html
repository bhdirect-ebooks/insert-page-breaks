<p>Pilate</p>
<p>unknowingly and ironically declares the Man of Suering as the messianic </p>
<p>King (cf. 19:14), who came to establish his kingdom and deliver human-</p>
<p>kind from the evil one. e chief priests and the ocers, who should have </p>
<p>understood this from the OT, could not see in the blood-stained Jesus the </p>
<p>kingly glory of God. erefore they cried out, “Crucify him, crucify him!” </p>
<p>(19:6a; cf. 19:15). </p>
<p>Pilate therefore became frustrated and said, “You take him and cruci-</p>
<p>fy” (19:6b). While the Jews themselves do not have authority to put anyone </p>
<p>to death, particularly by crucixion, Pilate’s statement shows his dejection </p>
<p>rather than his permission. He throws their own demand back in their face. </p>
<p>He means, “You take him, I do not care what you do with him! As for me, I </p>
<p>nd in him no probable cause.”</p>

<p>Without listening to Pilate’s judgment, “the</p>
<p>Jews” bring another charge: If there is no political crime, for them, Jesus has </p>
<p>committed religious crime by making himself the Son of God which, as per </p>
<p>the Jewish Law, is a blasphemy that deserves death (19:7; 10:30–33; cf. Lev </p>
<p>24:16), for it amounts to make himself God (5:18). e ruler became more </p>
fearful when he heard their words (19:8), for he took Jesus as a “divine man” who had divine origin and occult powers.

<p>With fear, Pilate probably takes Jesus into the praetorium (sixth scene) </p>
<p>and asks him, “Where are you from?” But this time Jesus does not give </p>
<p>any answer (19:9). Jesus conrms his heavenly origin when Pilate angrily </p>
<p>responds to Jesus’ silence, “Do you not speak to me? You know that I have </p>
<p>authority to release you and to crucify you, don’t you?” (19:10). He asserts </p>
<p>that he is “from above” from where authority has been given to Pilate ei-</p>
<p>ther to release him or to crucify him (19:11). Pilate lacks boldness, for he </p>
<p>expresses his anger to Jesus, who stands as a powerless man, rather than to </p>
<p>the crowd, which demands a guiltless man to be put to death. </p>
<p>Jesus warns Pilate, however, that although God has given authority </p>
<p>to him over Jesus, the one who delivered him to Pilate has “the greater sin” </p>
<p>(19:11b). e reference may be to Judas, the betrayer. However, although </p>
<p>Judas initiated the process, it was the Jewish accusers who handed over </p>
<p>Jesus to the religious and political authorities. us the singular “the one </p>
