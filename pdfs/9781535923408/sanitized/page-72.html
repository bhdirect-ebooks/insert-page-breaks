<p>Jesus’ Self-Revelation to the Samaritan Woman</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>Jesus’ reveals that the object of worship is God the Father (4:21b). </p>
<p>In the coming hour, aer Jesus’ death and resurrection, true worship will </p>
<p>be oered to the Father in “spirit and truth” (4:23–24). e Samaritans </p>
<p>worshipped Yahweh alongside foreign gods, and never as the Father with </p>
<p>whom believers can relate as children. As God is spirit (4:24), he cannot </p>
<p>be limited to any building or place. Jesus challenges that the Samaritans </p>
<p>(plural “you”) do not experience an intimacy with God as Father, whereas </p>
<p>the believing Jews (“we”) experience an intimate relationship with God by </p>
<p>the salvation they received in Jesus (4:22). By the neuter “what we know” </p>
<p>(4:22), Jesus means the believers’ intimate relationship with God as Father. </p>
<p>Salvation came to all human beings in Jesus, a Jew, born in the tribe of </p>
<p>Judah and in the line of David (T. Dan 5:10; T. Naph. 8:2; T. Gad 8:1). In </p>
<p>this sense, salvation is from the Jews (cf. Ps 76:1; Isa 2:3; Rom 9:4–5). us, </p>
<p>Jesus links worship with God’s work in Israel’s history, especially with the </p>
<p>incarnation of Christ. e place of worship has no signicance, but it is the </p>
<p>worshippers’ personal relationship with the Father that matters.</p>
<p>Jesus explains the manner of worship by using the word “an hour” </p>
<p>that is coming and by adding the phrase “and now is” (4:23). He means that </p>
<p>the opportune time to worship God, expected to happen at the end-time, </p>
<p>has already come by virtue of his death, resurrection, and ascension. e </p>
<p>eschatological worship can now be oered only in the church, God’s new </p>
<p>community, which knows God as Father. is community is constituted by </p>
<p>“true worshippers” who will worship the Father in “spirit and truth.” God </p>
<p>is looking for such people as those who worship him. e word “spirit” </p>
<p>denotes not the human spirit,</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>but the Holy Spirit, and this is clear from</p>
<p>the phrase “God is spirit” (4:24). e believing community is a worship-</p>
<p>ping community that is comprised of members who are born of the Spirit, </p>
<p>and their new birth enables them to rise above the earthly level and wor-</p>
<p>ship God with right attitude.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> e God who is spirit can be seen and wor-</p>
<p>shipped only in the spiritual realm. e word “truth” is knit together with </p>
<p>“spirit” by a single preposition, “in.” e OT concept of truth denotes God’s </p>
<p>faithfulness to his covenant relationship, and in John it was revealed in Je-</p>
<p>sus (1:14). us, true worship happens when the worshipper lives in the </p>
<p>spiritual realm and accepts the faithfulness of God to his covenant revealed </p>
<p>in Jesus.</p>
