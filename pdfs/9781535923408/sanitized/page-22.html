<p>Introduction</p>
<p>xxii</p>
<p>e above-mentioned writings enable us to infer that there were two </p>
<p>Johns: John the Son of Zebedee, who was the apostle John, and John the </p>
<p>Elder. Both of them were Jesus’ disciples who were ministering in Ephesus, </p>
<p>though John the Elder was not one of the Twelve. Hengel, who nds a close </p>
<p>parallel between the order in which Papias gives the names of disciples </p>
<p>(Eccl. Hist. 3.39.4) and that in John’s Gospel, identies Aristion and John </p>
<p>the Elder with the “two others of his disciples” of John 21:2.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>John the Son of Zebedee, who may be the “disciple whom Jesus loved,” </p>
<p>must have moved with a group of his followers, among whom was also </p>
<p>the presbyter John, from Palestine to Asia Minor around 66–70 CE and </p>
<p>perhaps joined the church in Ephesus founded by Paul.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>is community</p>
<p>eventually accepted the authority and leadership of the Beloved Disciple </p>
<p>and hence is known as the “Johannine community.” John the Elder (cf. 2 </p>
<p>John 1; 3 John 1), who was ordained by the apostle John to be his successor </p>
<p>in Ephesus, could have been a Jew, possibly from a priestly family in Jeru-</p>
<p>salem.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>He might have founded a learning center in Ephesus on behalf of</p>
<p>the Johannine community for studying, learning, teaching, and writing.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>By reconstructing the available information, we may say that John the </p>
<p>Elder composed the Fourth Gospel in Ephesus by using the sources written </p>
<p>and orally communicated by John the Son of Zebedee, an eyewitness of the </p>
<p>life and ministry of Jesus, when the apostle had died (ca. 98–117 or 98–101 </p>
<p>CE).</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>e experience of John the Elder, who himself was a disciple of Jesus,</p>
<p>and the sharing he had in the community of Jesus’ life and ministry, would </p>
<p>have been an added source to compose the Gospel with his own theology.</p>
<p>We may also see the hand of an editor in the nal stage of the writing </p>
<p>the Gospel in the glosses, comments, and explanations, including the trans-</p>
<p>lations of Hebrew/Aramaic words into Greek. e addition of chapter 21 </p>
<p>aer a proper conclusion in 20:30–31, with a nal conclusion in 21:24–25, </p>
<p>conrms the additional work of an editor. While the phrase “I suppose” </p>
(21:25) implies the editor as an individual, the phrase “we know” (21:24)
<p>11. Hengel 1989: 17–21; Culpepper 2000: 111–12.</p>
<p>12. Cf. Anderson 2011: 135.</p>
<p>13. Hengel 1989: 7, 125, 144 n. 29; Barrett 1978: 101–2. However, Polycrates, the </p>
<p>bishop of Ephesus (189–98 CE), identies John, who leaned back on the Lord’s breast, as </p>
<p>a priest (Eccl. Hist. 3.31.3; 5.24.3). is indicates the confusions prevailing in the “John </p>
<p>tradition.”</p>
<p>14. Hengel (1989: 22, 159 n. 122) gives evidence of several fragments that show a </p>
<p>direct connection existed between Papias and the presbyter John.</p>
