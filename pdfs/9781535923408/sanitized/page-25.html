<p>6, and Daniel 7) to see God’s glory as seated on the throne in human </p>
<p>form, was developing. John addresses this trend by emphasizing that </p>
<p>God’s kingly glory is to be seen in Jesus here on earth itself (1:14, 18, </p>
<p>50b–51; 3:13; 12:41; 14:9–11).</p>
<p>(iii) “e Jews” perceived the Christians’ worship of Jesus as a threat to </p>
Jewish monotheistic faith because of the Christian claim of divine
<p>revelation in Jesus Christ. Christians were accused of believing in two </p>
divine powers in heaven. In this context, one should understand the
<p>monotheistic faith of Christians reected in John’s Gospel (e.g., 5:18; </p>
<p>8:28, 29; 10:15, 30; 12:44–45; 14:8–11).</p>
<p>(iv) e Johannine community at this time faced several problems:</p>
<p>a. At the end of the rst century, the apostolic eyewitnesses, par-</p>
<p>ticularly the Beloved Disciple, had died. is situation possibly </p>
<p>could have led the Johannine community into confusion, inse-</p>
<p>curity, and a sharp leadership crisis. John 10:1–18 and 13:1–20 </p>
<p>seem to address the problem of leadership.</p>
<p>b. Because of the delay in Jesus’ second coming, the community </p>
<p>was losing hope, for some were expecting the return of Jesus </p>
<p>within the lifetime of the Beloved Disciple himself (cf. 21:23). </p>
<p>is situation may explain why John focuses more on the pres-</p>
<p>ent experience of eternal life and on the indwelling of Jesus </p>
<p>and the Father within the believers (e.g., 5:24; 6:40; 20:31; 15:4; </p>
<p>17:21–23) without diminishing the hope of future possession of </p>
<p>eternal life.</p>
c. e heretical groups, which questioned either the divinity of
<p>Jesus or his humanity, were inuencing Christians, particular-</p>
<p>ly the members of Johannine community. A group in Ephesus </p>
<p>seems to have claimed John the Baptist as the Light from heaven </p>
<p>and as the Messiah himself (cf. Acts 19:1–7).</p>
<p>Some believed that Jesus was the son of Joseph while Christ </p>
<p>was a celestial aeon who descended on Jesus at the time of his </p>
<p>baptism and le him before he was crucied. ey did not ac-</p>
cept the divinity of Jesus. is belief resembles that of Cerinthus,
<p>who possibly lived in the late rst century (cf. Irenaeus, Adv. </p>
<p>Haer. 3.3.4; 3.11.1).</p>
