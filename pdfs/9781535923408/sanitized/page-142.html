<p>Lazarus’ Resurrection and Its Implications</p>
<p>Raising of Lazarus from the dead (11:1–44) </p>
<p>John 11, which has Jesus’ seventh sign, links the events that happened at the </p>
<p>Jewish feasts and the events of Jesus’ suering and death. It is Lazarus’ res-</p>
<p>urrection, followed by Jesus’ triumphant entry into Jerusalem (12:12–19), </p>
<p>that eventually lead Jesus to death. ere are several events that link John </p>
<p>11 with previous chapters: Jesus’ staying two days longer in the place where </p>
<p>John at rst baptized (10:40) even aer hearing of Lazarus’ illness (11:6), </p>
<p>the attempt to stone at Jesus (11:8), the reference to light and life (11:9–10, </p>
<p>25–26) and to the healing of the man born blind (11:37), the authorities’ </p>
<p>plan to kill Jesus (11:46–53), and their order to arrest him (11:57).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>e death of Lazarus (11:1–16) </p>
<p>Lazarus, of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha, is intro-</p>
<p>duced as “certain man” who was ill (11:1). John takes it for granted that his </p>
<p>audience knew that Lazarus was the brother of Martha and Mary. Mary </p>
<p>attained signicance because she anointed Jesus with a costly ointment and </p>
<p>wiped his feet with her hair. Lazarus, who is mentioned now as her brother, </p>
<p>was ill (11:2). e two sisters sent a message to Jesus, who was ministering </p>
<p>in Bethany beyond Jordan, saying, “Lord, behold, he whom you love is ill” </p>
<p>(11:3). e sisters obviously expected Jesus to come and heal Lazarus (cf. </p>
<p>11:21, 32). e description of Lazarus as “the one whom you love” shows </p>
<p>Lazarus’ intimacy with Jesus. It is dicult, however, to prove that Lazarus </p>
<p>is “the disciple whom Jesus loved” (13:23), as the name of this disciple is </p>
<p>completely hidden in John.</p>
