<p>Veiled References to Jesus as the Christ</p>

<p>11:45). ere is no evidence in Jewish literature for the belief that when </p>
<p>the Christ appears he will perform miracles. However, the OT refers to the </p>
<p>miracles that will happen at the time of nal salvation (Isa 35:5–6; 61:1). </p>
<p>But it is natural for the Jews to wonder whether such a miracle worker as </p>
<p>Jesus might not be the Messiah</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>(cf. Matt 11:2–5; 12:22–23, 28; Mark 8:11;</p>
<p>13:21–22; Luke 11:16, which identify doing signs as a mark of the Messiah).</p>
<p>e Pharisees heard the mutterings about Jesus’ messianic identity. </p>
<p>Seeking to maintain order in the temple, the chief priests and the Pharisees </p>
<p>sent the temple police to arrest Jesus (7:32). Foreknowing this, Jesus hinted </p>
<p>at his death and resurrection. “I shall be with you a little longer” (7:33; cf. </p>
<p>12:25–26; 13:3, 33, 36) is Jesus’ prediction on his brief time on earth before </p>
<p>he goes to the Father through the cross and resurrection (cf. 12:35; 13:33; </p>
<p>14:19; 16:16). Aer he goes to the Father, the people will seek him but they </p>
<p>will neither nd him nor be able to go to him (7:34). </p>
<p>e Jews could not grasp the meaning of Jesus’ sayings, “You will seek </p>
<p>me and you will not nd me” and “Where I am you cannot come” (7:36). </p>
<p>ey sarcastically asked one another, “Where is this man about to go that </p>
<p>we shall not nd him? He is not going to the Dispersion among the Greeks </p>
<p>to teach the Greeks; is he?” (7:35; cf. 8:22). ough the word “dispersion” </p>
<p>denotes the Jews who were living outside Palestine (cf. Deut 28:25; 30:4; </p>
<p>Isa 49:6; Ps 147:2; 2 Macc 1:27; Pss. Sol. 8:34), the “Greeks” to whom Jesus </p>
<p>may go to teach could refer to the Greek-speaking natives rather than the </p>
<p>Greek-speaking Jews.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> Ironically, the crowd’s sarcastic question, which ex-</p>
<p>pects the answer “no,” becomes in John an unconscious prophecy for Jesus’ </p>
<p>ministry to the Greeks (12:20–26), which will be followed by his apostles </p>
<p>aer his ascension (e.g., Acts 11:20–21).</p>

<p>(7:37–52)</p>
<p>e last day of the feast, being the eighth day, was the “great day” and </p>
<p>praising and rejoicing continued (m. Sukkah 4:8). People oered food of-</p>
<p>ferings and lived in booths for seven days (Lev 23:34, 36a, 41, 42). On the </p>
<p>seventh day, there used to be a procession of the priests and people, with </p>
<p>the water drawn from the pool of Siloam, to the temple where the priests </p>
<p>would pour out the water and wine at the base of the altar (m. Mid. 2:7; m. </p>

<p>term to mean the Gentiles in the Greco-Roman world at large.</p>
