<p>Prologue</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>is is to rebut communities that regarded the Baptist toward the end of </p>
<p>the rst century as the Redeemer sent by God (cf. Luke 3:15) or even as the </p>
<p>Light.</p>
<p>e Baptist’s testimony prepares the way for the Logos to come in esh </p>
<p>to reveal God’s character and to oer eternal life for those who believe. e </p>
<p>Baptist conrms that Christ was pre-existent and that he is greater than </p>
<p>the Baptist in status and rank (1:15). In fact, 1:15 does not interrupt the </p>
<p>ow of thought between 1:14 and 1:16–18. Whereas 1:14 narrates the wit-</p>
<p>ness of the believing community to the glory revealed in the Logos-Son, </p>
<p>1:15 expresses the witness of the Baptist to the same glory, which was pre-</p>
<p>existing as the Logos, even though temporally the Logos became esh aer </p>
<p>the Baptist was born (cf. 1:26–27, 29–30; Matt 3:11 par.).</p>
<p>New humanity Enlightened by the Light (1:9–13)</p>
<p>e third section of the prologue introduces the Logos as “the true Light.” </p>
<p>at is, he is the “genuine” or “authentic” Light, surpassing any other lights, </p>
<p>which are “obsolete, defective, and unreliable.”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>He was coming into the</p>
<p>world, the realm of human aairs, to enlighten every human being (1:9). </p>
<p>“Enlightenment” means not just the attainment of intellectual knowledge </p>
<p>but the insight one may get about God and his purpose for human beings. It </p>
<p>is an illumination that transforms people from their evil nature to do good </p>
<p>works. e universal implication of this mission is known from the word </p>
<p>“every human.”</p>
<p>Even though the Light in the Logos came into the world, the world </p>
<p>failed to know him (1:10). “Knowing” is a key word used in the Gospel to </p>
<p>mean not so much the Hellenistic and Gnostic notion of intellectual per-</p>
<p>ception as an active relationship between God and his people (see Amos </p>
<p>3:2 for God knowing his people in terms of choosing them and caring for </p>
<p>them, and Jer 31:33–34 for the humans to know God in terms of their hum-</p>
<p>ble obedience and trust in him). e word “world” in John refers mainly to </p>
<p>those who reject Jesus and his followers because of their hostility towards </p>
<p>them (e.g., 15:18–19; 17:14). God’s provision to humankind to become </p>
<p>children of God and the world’s rejection are pregured in the prologue </p>
<p>(1:9–10).</p>
<p>e Logos-Light was rejected, notably, by his own people. In John, the </p>
<p>term “my own” denotes the people chosen by Jesus (or those given by God </p>
