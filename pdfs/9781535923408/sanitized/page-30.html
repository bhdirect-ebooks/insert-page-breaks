<p>Prologue</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>the very life of God. e Logos and God, as two personalities, were living </p>
<p>so close with one another that they cannot be separated one from the other. </p>
<p>Such union means an active partnership or a reciprocal indwelling between </p>
<p>two personalities.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>e Word’s mutual indwelling and life in oneness with God are eter-</p>
<p>nal, as the statement “the Word was God” (1:1c) shows. Like Philo, John </p>
<p>also identies the pre-existent Logos with God without the denite article, </p>
<p>for in 1:1c the Logos, as God, is dierentiated from “the God.” Otherwise, </p>
<p>1:1c will contradict what is expressed in 1:1b–2 and 14:28. erefore it is </p>
needless to translate “divine (in essence) was the Logos.”
<p>4</p>
<p>While “the God”</p>
<p>points to “the one true God,” the Father, “God,” in this context, can only in-</p>
<p>dicate the Logos as the manifestation of that God. “e God” refers to God </p>
<p>in his transcendence, while “God” implies the revelation and immanence of </p>
<p>that one God. is does not mean that the Logos was the “second God.” e </p>
<p>Logos is the self-manifestation of God precisely because he exists eternally </p>
<p>in oneness with God, the Father. is is reiterated in 1:2.</p>
<p>John describes also the role of the pre-existent Logos in creation: “all </p>
<p>things” came into being through him and “not even one that has come into </p>
<p>being” came without him (1:3). at is, the totality of creation came into </p>
<p>existence through the Logos. is does not mean that the Logos was merely </p>
<p>an “instrumental cause” (Philo) in creation. e creative activity of the Lo-</p>
<p>gos was the creative activity of God. e Logos and Wisdom are parallels, </p>
<p>for Wisdom too pre-existed with God and was engaged in God’s creative </p>
<p>activity (Prov 3:19–20; 8:22–31; Sir 1:1–10). All things in heaven and on </p>
<p>earth were created through Christ and for Christ (1 Cor 8:6b; Col 1:16–17; </p>
<p>Heb 1:2; Rev 3:14). </p>
<p>God’s creation was community oriented (Gen 1–2), for God created </p>
<p>“all things” as families according to their kinds (Gen 1:21, 24–25). John, </p>
<p>therefore, begins his Gospel by disclosing the community motif embedded </p>
<p>in creation. e whole creation constitutes one household of God. All crea-</p>
<p>tures came to life by God’s word, but human beings by God’s breath (Gen </p>
<p>2:7; 1:26–27). Since life ows from God to the total creation, John categori-</p>
<p>cally states, “In him was life” (1:4a). e Genesis story connects light with </p>
life. So also John presents divine life and light together by writing, “And
<p>the life was the Light of humankind” (1:4b). e life of Logos derived from </p>
