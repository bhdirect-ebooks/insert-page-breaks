<p>John 3:1–12</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>of repentance only and is superseded by the coming of Christ, who will </p>
<p>baptize with the Holy Spirit (1:26–27, 33). In John’s Gospel, “water” is </p>
<p>mainly used as a symbol for the Holy Spirit, who will lead the receipient </p>
<p>to eternal life (John 4:14–15; 7:37–39; cf. Ezek 47:9). One can say that in </p>
<p>3:5 water and Spirit are used synonymously, one being the symbol and the </p>
<p>other reality. It is the Spirit that enables one to be reborn into the family of </p>
<p>God and thus to come under the rule of God. e meaning of 3:3 and 3:5 </p>
<p>nally is merged into the phrase “born of the Spirit” (3:8).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Why, then, does</p>
<p>John write “water and spirit” if both refer to the Holy Spirit as the source </p>
<p>of rebirth? By placing both the terms together, John stresses the twofold </p>
<p>function of the Holy Spirit: life-giving and empowering. Both are related </p>
<p>experiences in the realm of God’s rule. </p>
<p>John introduces another dramatic dualism: a life controlled by the </p>
<p>esh against the life controlled by the Holy Spirit (3:6). Anyone who is not </p>
<p>born of the Spirit lives still in the realm of esh, that is, under the rule of the </p>
<p>fallen human nature that is prone to sin, and therefore exhibits the deeds of </p>
<p>the esh (cf. Gal 5:19–21). In contrast, those who are born of God by the </p>
Spirit exhibit the works of the Spirit. ey partake in the divine nature and show divine qualities (cf. Gal 5:22–23).
<p>Aer exhorting Nicodemus not to marvel at his teaching on new birth </p>
<p>(3:7), Jesus claries that the origin and work of the Spirit within a person is </p>
<p>imperceptible to anyone who lives in the realm of esh, just like the origin </p>
<p>and direction of the blowing wind cannot be perceived (John 3:8; cf. Eccl </p>
<p>11:5), because spirit and esh are opposed to each other (Gal 5:17). What a </p>
<p>natural person can see is the fruit of new life manifested in a person who is </p>
<p>born of the Spirit, but no one can comprehend the mode of the Spirit’s work </p>
<p>within that person. With astonishment, Nicodemus questioned, “How can </p>
<p>these things happen?” (3:9). Jesus rebuked him for his lack of understand-</p>
<p>ing, although he was a teacher of the Law in Israel (3:10). Nicodemus must </p>
<p>have known about regeneration by the Spirit from the OT itself, which </p>
<p>speaks of the Spirit’s work that gives a new heart and life (Ps 51:10; Isa 44:3; </p>
<p>Ezek 11:19–20; 36:26–27; Joel 2:28–29). </p>
<p>By using the phrase “truly, truly, I say to you,” Jesus arms, “We speak </p>
<p>what we know and testify to what we have seen but you do not receive </p>
<p>our testimony” (3:11). e plural pronouns “we” and “you” show that Je-</p>
<p>sus is speaking as the representative of the new covenant community, by </p>
<p>3. For the argument that both water and spirit stand for the Holy Spirit see Ridderbos </p>
