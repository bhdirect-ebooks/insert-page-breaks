<p>JOHN 2</p>
<p>The Beginning of Jesus’ Public Ministry</p>
<p>Jesus’ Public Ministry (2:1—12:50)</p>
<p>Some scholars treat John 2 as the beginning of the unit that ends at 4:54, </p>
<p>oen given the title “From Cana to Cana.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>is section pictures how the</p>
<p>rst sign took place in Cana of Galilee (2:1–12) and the second sign, which </p>
<p>completes the rst sphere of Jesus’ Galilean ministry, also took place in </p>
<p>Cana (4:46–54). God’s new community was expanded by including both </p>
<p>the Jews and the Gentiles. </p>
<p>First sign of Jesus in John (2:1–12)</p>
<p>In 2:1–12 a vision of Jesus’ glory, promised in 1:51, becomes possible rst in </p>
<p>a wedding at Cana, the native place of Nathanael, situated in Galilee eight </p>
<p>miles north of Nazareth, where Jesus was brought up. e time reference </p>
<p>“on the third day” implies not only that Jesus’ revelation of his glory took </p>
<p>place aer three days of his promise (1:50b-51) but also that by this time </p>
<p>the circle of twelve disciples was complete. If we count the number of days </p>
<p>from the time the Baptist witnessed about Jesus (1:19–2:1), the wedding </p>
<p>at Cana falls on the seventh day. Brown sees here an implicit reference to </p>
<p>God’s creation of the world in seven days (Gen 1:1–2:3) and argues that </p>
<p>John is seeing the start of Jesus’ ministry as the start of new creation.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>symbolic interpretation looks forward to the creation of a new humanity by </p>
<p>Jesus who was raised on the third day (20:22).</p>
<p>Galilee had both Jews and Gentiles in it, and the beginning of Jesus’ </p>
<p>ministry and his rst sign performed there may symbolically mean that he </p>
<p>loves both Jews and Gentiles and that they have an equal place in the new </p>
<p>community he came to create. “e mother of Jesus was there” implies that </p>
