<p>e Samaritan woman who brings her people to Jesus is one</p>
<p>of the harvesters and not one of those who labored for the harvest. </p>
<p>Inclusion of Samaritans into God’s new community </p>
<p>(4:39–42) </p>
<p>e Samaritan woman’s faith in Jesus as the Messiah, though with some </p>
<p>hesitation, and her word of testimony were so powerful that they led many </p>
<p>Samaritans to the initial faith in Jesus prior to their meeting with him </p>
<p>(4:39)! Jesus accepted people of ckle faith in the beginning stage so that </p>
<p>he might reveal himself to them more clearly (see 1:46; 3:9; 4:33; 7:41–42; </p>
<p>11:39; 18:33).</p>
<p>e woman proclaimed Jesus’ supernatural knowledge of what all </p>
<p>she had done and how she had lived. Such prophetic utterance, according </p>
<p>to Samaritan belief, cannot come from any other person than the coming </p>
<p>taheb who will declare everything. So they immediately came to him and </p>
<p>asked him to stay with them. Jesus broke the enmity between Jews and Sa-</p>
<p>maritans by staying with them for two days (4:40), which would have been </p>
<p>scandalous for a Jew. e Evangelist’s comment that many more believed </p>
<p>because of his word (4:41) shows that Jesus, during his two-day stay, had </p>
<p>dialogue with the Samaritans on things related to human salvation. Jesus’ </p>
<p>words convinced many in Sychar that he was the Messiah who came from </p>
<p>heaven to save the whole world.</p>
<p>e Samaritans’ faith was fully founded on Jesus’ words of salvation </p>
<p>and not any more on the woman’s word of testimony. is implies that Jesus </p>
<p>sowed the seed within the Samaritan woman by revealing himself as the </p>
<p>long-awaited Messiah, and the woman’s testimony made the harvest. In this </p>
<p>sense, she may be identied as an apostle. e Samaritans publicly con-</p>
<p>fessed, “we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man is indeed </p>
<p>the Savior of the world” (4:42). In the rst century, Hellenistic gods such </p>
<p>as Zeus and Asclepius, as well as the gods Isis and Serapis of the mystery </p>
<p>religions, were called saviors. e same title was ascribed to the Roman </p>
<p>emperors from Nero to Hadrian.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>But Christians were exalting Jesus as</p>
<p>the Savior of the world long before John was written (Luke 1:47; 2:11; Acts </p>
<p>5:31; 13:23; Phil 3:20; 1 Tim 1:1; 2:3; 4:10; 2 Tim 1:10; Titus 2:10, 13). e </p>
