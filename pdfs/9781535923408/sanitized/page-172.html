<p>JOHN 14</p>
<p>Jesus’ Pastoral Speech I</p>
<p>e content of John 14:1—16:33 is normally called Jesus’ “Farewell Dis-</p>
<p>course” delivered to his disciples. However, Jesus is not going to leave them </p>
<p>permanently. He promises to come back to take them to his Father’s house </p>
<p>(14:3, 28). Also, he will meet them aer his resurrection for commissioning </p>
<p>them (20:13–29).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> John 14:1—16:33 contains Jesus’ exhortation, admoni-</p>
<p>tion, encouragement, promises, and warnings. erefore it is appropriate </p>
<p>to understand the section as Jesus’ “Pastoral Speech” given to his disciples. </p>
<p>It ts well into his Pastoral/Priestly Prayer in John 17.</p>
<p>The Son’s revelation of the Father (14:1–14) </p>
<p>Judas having le the community of disciples, Jesus now has an exclusive </p>
<p>session with the eleven disciples. He encourages them, saying, “Let your </p>
<p>hearts not be troubled” (14:1a), which looks back to Jesus’ statements </p>
<p>about his departure (13:33, 36) and his prediction of Peter’s denial (13:38), </p>
<p>besides his foretelling of Judas’ betrayal (13:21). e plural “your hearts” </p>
<p>includes all disciples who were agitated at what Jesus had predicted. Jesus </p>
<p>exhorts them to continue believing in God and in him (14:1b). In this con-</p>
<p>text, “believing” means “trusting rmly” in times of distress. One cannot </p>
<p>believe in God without believing in Jesus, because Jesus is the revelation of </p>
<p>God (12:44).</p>
<p>As Jesus is from above (8:23; 6:46) and has come down from heaven </p>
<p>(6:33, 38, 51), he has seen that there are many dwelling places “in my </p>
<p>Father’s house.” He conrms this truth by his question, “if it were not so, </p>
<p>would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you?” (14:2). e </p>
<p>phrase “my Father’s house” could denote the temple (2:16). Possibly there is </p>
<p>a temple motif here that identies the Father’s house as a heavenly temple </p>
<p>into which Jesus, the high priest, will enter with his own blood aer his </p>
