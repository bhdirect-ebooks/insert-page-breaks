<p>John 18:12–27</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>that dishonored the high priest.”</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Jesus challenges the ocial to prove that</p>
<p>he broke the law, “You shall not . . . curse a ruler of your people” (Exod </p>
<p>22:28; cf. Acts 23:5). If he is unable to prove it, then there is no ground for </p>
<p>striking Jesus. No one can convict Jesus of having spoken evil (cf. 8:46). </p>
<p>Annas sees the illegal assault on Jesus but fails to do justice in the trial. </p>
<p>He sends Jesus bound to Caiaphas, the high priest of that year (18:24, cf. </p>
<p>18:13). Without mentioning what happened in Caiaphas’ palace, the scene </p>
<p>now turns to the events happening outside (18:25–27). is is the Gospel’s </p>
<p>characteristic “vestigial scenes,” in which a stage is set but nothing happens </p>
<p>(e.g., 2:12; 11:54; 12:9, 20–22).</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>18:25 resumes Peter’s act of standing and warming himself (18:18) to </p>
<p>give continuity to Peter’s rst denial. e servants and the temple guards </p>
<p>question Peter with suspicion, “And you are not one of his disciples, are </p>
<p>you?,” and Peter denies the second time by assuring, “I am not” (18:25). </p>
<p>However, a servant of the high priest who was the relative of Malchus and </p>
<p>who had seen Peter cutting Malchus’ ear questions him, “Did I not see you </p>
<p>in the garden with him?” (18:26). Peter denies the third time. Immediately </p>
<p>a cock crows (18:27; cf. 13:38). </p>
<p>Peter denied Jesus three times to save his own life, although he prom-</p>
<p>ised that he would lay down his life for his Master (13:37). But Jesus pre-</p>
<p>dicted that the cock would not crow till Peter had denied him three times </p>
<p>(13:38), and his prediction was fullled (18:17–18, 25–27). Such fulllment </p>
<p>shows that Jesus is the revealer of God and his words. John follows Matthew </p>
<p>in this narrative rather than Mark, who refers to the rooster crowing twice </p>
<p>before Peter’s denial of Jesus (Matt 26:34, 74; Mark 14:30, 71). Also, the </p>
<p>reference to Peter’s weeping bitterly by remembering what Jesus already </p>
<p>told him (Matt 26:75; Mark 14:71) is missing in John. What Peter promised </p>
<p>in human strength is proved by Jesus to be useless (cf. 6:63). Since Jesus </p>
<p>had known the weakness of his disciples, he did not answer Annas about </p>
<p>them, but only about his teaching. John presents Peter’s denial dramatically </p>
<p>and ironically as taking place outside at the time when the high priest was </p>
<p>interrogating Jesus about his disciples inside! John does not refer to Peter </p>
<p>again until aer Jesus’ resurrection.</p>
