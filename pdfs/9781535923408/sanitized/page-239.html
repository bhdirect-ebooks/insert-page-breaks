<p>John 21:20–23</p>
<p>211</p>
<p>Prediction on the beloved disciple (21:20–23) </p>
<p>At the point of Jesus’ prediction of Peter’s martyrdom, Peter turned and </p>
<p>saw the beloved disciple already following Jesus (21:20). e beloved dis-</p>
<p>ciple is reintroduced by citing the Passover meal scene, where he was rst </p>
<p>introduced as the disciple whom Jesus loved, who, by lying close to Jesus’ </p>
<p>breast, asked him, at the behest of Peter, to identify the betrayer of Jesus (cf. </p>
<p>13:23–25). When Peter saw his close associate, he asked Jesus, “Lord, but </p>
<p>what about this man?” (21:21), which may mean, “How will this man’s life </p>
<p>and end be?” Obviously he was curious to know of the beloved disciple’s </p>
<p>future. Jesus discourages such curiosity to know from him of his plan for </p>
<p>others. It is the God-given prerogative of Jesus to determine the future of </p>
<p>each person, and no one has any business with others’ matter. So Jesus said </p>
<p>to Peter, “If I wish him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You </p>
<p>follow me” (21:22).</p>
<p>Jesus has authority from the Father to give life or to judge in accor-</p>
<p>dance to his will (5:21–22, 27). “To remain” here means “to live.” Jesus’ ref-</p>
<p>erence to “until I come” does not indicate his coming as the Holy Spirit, but </p>
<p>his nal coming to take his disciples to the Father’s house (14:2–3). Jesus </p>
<p>has authority to keep anyone whom he chooses to be alive until the end-</p>
<p>time. Others, including his own disciples, can hardly intervene in Jesus’ will </p>
<p>and work. erefore Jesus admonishes Peter, with an emphatic “you,” to </p>
<p>follow him by xing his eyes upon Jesus alone (cf. 21:19).</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Moreover, Jesus’</p>
<p>will is dierent for each person and others need not be anxious to know it. </p>
<p>Jesus’ instruction in John ends with “you follow me,” signaling that the aim </p>
<p>of God’s new community should be to constantly look to Jesus in life and </p>
<p>work until his nal coming (Heb 12:2; cf. Phil 3:13–15). Jesus’ saying in </p>
<p>21:22 was misunderstood to spread among the “brothers,” the members of </p>
<p>Jesus’ community, a rumor that the beloved disciple will never die (21:23a). </p>
<p>e editor claries Jesus’ hypothetical statement concerning the be-</p>
<p>loved disciple by writing, “Yet Jesus did not say to him that he will not die, </p>
<p>but only that if it is his will that he remains until he comes, what is that to </p>
<p>you?” (21:23b). In Matthew, the soldiers, on the instigation of the Jewish </p>
<p>leaders, spread among the Jews a false message that Jesus’ body was stolen </p>
<p>by night by his disciples (Matt 28:11–15). John, on the other hand, records a </p>
<p>rumor spread among his followers, especially in the Johannine community, </p>
<p>that the beloved disciple will not die until Jesus comes (cf. Mark 9:1). John </p>
<p>16. Cf. Michaels 2010: 1052.</p>
