<p>Raising of Lazarus from the Dead</p>

<p>(“privately”) with Martha speaking to Mary than with Martha calling her,</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p>for only aer Mary heard Martha did Mary rise quickly and go out to meet </p>
<p>Jesus (11:29, 31). is shows that Martha must have spoken with Mary se-</p>
<p>cretly in the midst of other mourners so that she too might go and welcome </p>
<p>Jesus, who was still outside the village in the place where Martha met him </p>
<p>(11:30). e use of the word “the teacher” shows that Martha, and possibly </p>
<p>Mary too, considered themselves as learners from Jesus. e expression “is </p>
<p>here” does not indicate in this context the coming (parousia) of Jesus.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>It</p>
<p>simply conveys the nearness of Jesus outside the village. e text does not </p>
<p>say that Jesus was calling for Mary. However, Martha’s words “e teacher </p>
<p>is here and is calling you” could be a euphemism used to get Mary to meet </p>
<p>with Jesus. Mary’s quick response to go to Jesus shows her love and high </p>
<p>regard for him. Most probably Martha also followed her, as both of them </p>
<p>were at Lazarus’ tomb (10:39–40).</p>
<p>e neighbors who were sitting with Mary (11:19) saw her rise quickly </p>
<p>and go out. ey thought that she was departing to the tomb to weep there </p>
<p>and therefore they followed her (11:31). eir underlying concern was that </p>
<p>they should not leave a bereaved person alone. Mary, however, came to </p>
<p>the place where Jesus was. When she saw him, she fell at his feet and said </p>
<p>almost verbatim what Martha had told in 11:21 (11:32). She thus expressed </p>
<p>her belief in the life-giving power of Jesus! “Falling at Jesus’ feet,” in Mary’s </p>
<p>case, is a symbolic act of paying homage (cf. 12:1–8) and of pouring her </p>
<p>grief to him with tears (11:33). Mary’s humble act so moved the hearts of </p>
<p>her friends that they wept. When Jesus saw Mary and the Jews weeping out </p>
<p>of sorrow, he became greatly agitated in his spirit and troubled (11:33, 38). </p>
<p>He expressed his erce indignation toward death by his inner groaning (cf. </p>
<p>Lam 2:6).</p>
<p>With grief, Jesus asked for the place where Lazarus’ body was laid </p>
<p>and they led him to the tomb by saying, “Lord, come and see” (11:34). e </p>
<p>word “they” could refer to the two sisters who were accompanied by their </p>
<p>friends. It does not seem that they had yet reached Lazarus’ tomb, but Je-</p>
<p>sus’ emotion, mixed with his compassion for the bereaved, made him weep </p>
<p>along with them. e Greek word dokruein, used in the aorist tense for </p>
<p>Jesus’ weeping, is dierent from the word that is used in the present tense </p>
<p>for Mary’s and the Jews’ weeping (klaiein). is means that Jesus did not </p>
<p>join in the mourners’ continual crying, but that he “burst into tears” out </p>
