<p>John 7:14–36</p>

<p>much more the healing of the whole person should be accepted (7:23).</p>

<p>He</p>
<p>questions why his opponents are angry while he has thus fullled the Sab-</p>
<p>bath law. Jesus’ questions (7:19, 23) are to enable them to judge him and his </p>
<p>works soberly and not to accuse him by seeing his work outwardly (7:24). </p>
<p>Jesus’ public admonition led some people in Jerusalem to doubt </p>
<p>whether he was the man whom the religious authorities were seeking to </p>
<p>kill (7:25; the indenite plural “they” refers to Jewish authorities; cf. 7:26b). </p>
<p>ey questioned among themselves whether the authorities themselves are </p>
<p>convinced that “this man” (Jesus) is the Christ (7:26).</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>e Jerusalemites</p>
<p>had known the place whence Jesus came, alluding to Nazareth (7:27a; </p>
<p>7:41b; cf. 6:42). ey had also learned that no one will know the origin of </p>
<p>the Christ when he appears (7:27b). Although, according to the scriptures, </p>
<p>Christ will come from Bethlehem, the city of David (Mic 5:2; cf. 7:42), there </p>
<p>was a belief in the late rst century that the Messiah would be kept hidden </p>
<p>before God until he reveals himself “in the time of his day” (1 En. 38:2–3; 4 </p>
<p>Ezra 12:32). A Qumran writing refers to “a holy branch” that is to be hidden </p>
<p>(1QH 8.4–36; cf. Isa 11:1; Jer 23:5, where “a righteous branch” denotes the </p>
<p>messianic King) and this hiddenness will be until the time when he would </p>
<p>reveal to the Teacher his salvation (1QH 5.11–12). e crowd reects in </p>
<p>7:27 the rst-century belief on the hidden origin of the Messiah.</p>
<p>Since people did not believe that he is the Christ who came from God, </p>
<p>as he taught in the temple he told them that they knew his origin only in </p>
<p>terms of his physical birth or residence and claried that he did not come </p>
<p>on his own authority or initiative (cf. 7:17; 5:19). He admonished the unbe-</p>
<p>lievers that they did not know God, the trustworthy and faithful one, who </p>
<p>sent him (7:28; cf. 7:18). He claimed that since he comes from God, who </p>
<p>sent him, he alone intimately knows him (7:29; cf. 6:46). us, Jesus reveals </p>
<p>himself as the pre-existent Christ hidden to human eyes.</p>
<p>e unbelieving Jews took Jesus’ claims as blasphemous and therefore </p>
<p>sought to “lay hands on” him (7:30). But no one could seize him, because </p>
<p>the time of the Father to glorify his Son on the cross had not yet come (cf. </p>
<p>2:4; 8:20, 59; 10:39). e “many” who believed in him did so only with </p>
<p>the question, “When Christ appears, will he do more signs than this man </p>
<p>did?” (7:31). eir faith obviously was based on Jesus’ signs alone (cf. 2:23; </p>
<p>6. e Greek holon anthrōpon means “the whole person,” implying Jesus’ holistic </p>
<p>healing of the paralytic in John 5.</p>
<p>7. eir question is put in a tentative and hesitating way, as it starts with the Greek </p>
<p>mēpote (cf. 4:29).</p>
