<p>(9:26). ey already knew the manner in which Jesus opened the man’s eyes </p>
<p>(9:15). However, they try to prevent him from believing Jesus by convinc-</p>
<p>ing him that Jesus is a sinner. </p>
<p>e healed man turns the table against the authorities by chiding </p>
<p>them for their non-understanding and their unwillingness to listen to what </p>
<p>he already told them. He prudently refuses to repeat the whole story. He </p>
<p>counter-questions, “Why do you wish to hear it again? You do not want </p>
<p>to become his disciples, do you?” (9:27). “You did not listen” means that </p>
<p>the Pharisees neither accept the reality of healing nor believe in the healer. </p>
<p>Investigation done with this mindset will be in vain. His second question is </p>
<p>sarcastic, expecting the answer “no,” for he knows that they do not wish to </p>
<p>become Jesus’ disciples even aer knowing of Jesus’ sign. Ironically, a blind </p>
<p>beggar, by virtue of his sight received from Jesus, is turned to do the func-</p>
<p>tion of a religious leader to admonish the “religious leaders” themselves. </p>
<p>ey, not the man born blind, are defective in sight.</p>

<p>e ocials told him angrily, with an emphatic “you,” “You are his dis-</p>
<p>ciple” (9:28a). ey took the man’s question “Do you also want to become </p>
<p>his disciples?” as an admission that he is his disciple.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>ey boastfully said,</p>
<p>with an emphatic “we,” “But we are the disciples of Moses,” assuming that </p>
<p>to be Moses’ disciples is superior to being Jesus’ disciples (9:28b). ey set </p>
<p>Moses and Jesus in opposition to each other without grasping that Moses </p>
<p>wrote of Jesus (5:46). ey were proud of observing Moses’ Law, ignoring </p>
<p>that Moses, on whom they had set their hope, himself will accuse them </p>
<p>before the Father (5:45).</p>
<p>e subject of the dialogue now turns to the origin of Jesus. ey </p>
<p>rightly believed that God spoke to Moses, even face to face (Exod 33:11; </p>
<p>Num 12:8; cf. Deut 34:10–11), but belittled Jesus by confessing their ig-</p>
<p>norance of the place where “this man” comes from (9:29). In fact they had </p>
<p>heard from Jesus several times about his origin (3:13; 6:38, 41, 42, 51; 7:29; </p>
<p>8:23). “e Jews” tried to impress upon the mind of the healed man a wrong </p>
<p>notion that Moses is greater than Jesus. e man’s personal experience of </p>
<p>Jesus’ healing gave him courage to point out the irrelevant speech of the </p>
<p>religious leaders by telling them, “ere is marvel in this, because you do </p>
<p>not know where he is from, but he opened my eyes!” (9:30). </p>
<p>e man starts teaching the teachers of the Law the common truth: </p>
<p>ey all know, including the Pharisees, that God does not listen to the </p>
