        <h1>18. Counsel and Blessing</h1>
        <p class="center" style="font-family:NuptialScript;font-size:2em;margin-bottom:2em">1 Peter 5:7–14</p>
        <p class="center" style="margin:0 3em 3em 3em"><span class="mini">  And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast. To him be the power for ever and ever</span>. (1 Peter 5:10–11)</p>
        <p style="text-indent:0"><span class="dcap bgcolor">A</span> certain company attracts customers to its health products by offering to test people’s “real age.” The test allegedly compares a person’s chronological age to his body’s real age. If<span/>someone eats fruits and vegetables, sleeps enough, and exercises daily, the test declares that his real age is less than his birth certificate indicates. But if he sleeps three hours per night, smokes cigarettes, devours cheeseburgers, and commutes by helicopter, the test says, “Because of your risk factors, your life expectancy is less than anticipated.” It then delivers counsel that, if followed, will lead to a longer life.</p>
        <p>First Peter 5 presents the apostle’s counsel to people who have a great risk factor: they resolved to follow Jesus in a world that was hostile to the faith. The Christians in Peter’s churches no longer worshiped pagan deities, no longer bowed to the emperor or participated in pagan revelry. That brought <span>danger. Change upsets people. Friends questioned these believers, and the empire entertained suspicions. </span></p>
        <p>Peter’s counsel aims at a <span class="mini">faithful</span> life more directly than a <span class="mini">long</span> life. He commands the church to “humble yourselves” (1 Peter 5:6), “cast all your anxiety on him” (5:7), “be self-controlled and alert” (5:8, a double command), and “resist” the devil (5:9). Peter’s commands rest on a theological foundation, as his last passage begins and ends with God. His hand is mighty (5:6), he cares for us (5:7), and he is gracious (5:10a). He has called us to glory and promises to restore us (5:10). He can make good on his promises because he possesses eternal power (5:11). Clearly, the character of God is the basis for our faithfulness and confidence.</p>

        <h2>The Might and Care of God</h2>
        <p>As we saw in the previous chapter, Peter commands his people, “Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand, that he may lift you up” (1 Peter 5:6). In the exodus, the mighty hand of God liberated Israel from Egypt’s oppression (Ex. 13:9; Deut. 3:24; 7:19). The New Testament describes the work of Jesus as a second exodus. At the transfiguration, as Luke 9:30–31 says, Moses and Elijah spoke to Jesus “of his departure [literally, <span class="mini">exodus</span>], which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem” (<span class="smallcaps">ESV</span>). As an Israelite, Peter knew the blessings that God gave Israel when he established the new nation after the exodus. Peter claimed and applied those blessings to his Gentile converts in 1 Peter 2:9–10. If Jesus accomplished a new exodus for the Gentiles, then they enjoy God’s power and compassion, just as Israel did. Because God is strong, because he has a “mighty hand,” Peter tells his people, “Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you” (5:6–7).</p>
        <p>Peter asserts that God’s favor depends on both his grace and his power: “the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, . . . will himself restore you and make you strong.” He will fulfill this promise because he has “power for ever and ever” (1 Peter 5:10–11).</p>
        <p>Throughout his epistle, Peter has sprinkled advice to help his people endure trials. They should avoid trouble by respecting governors and masters (1 Peter 2:13–18). Ordinarily, no trouble should arise for the man or woman who tells the truth, does good, seeks peace, and shows compassion (3:8–11). The church should also stand together, with shepherds overseeing a will<span>ing flock (5:1–4). Still, before Peter signs off, he delivers more counsel. His people should humble themselves (5:6), cast their anxieties on God (5:7), be watchful (5:8), and resist the devil (5:8–9), all while trusting God’s grace and the power that makes them strong (5:10–11). </span></p>
        <p>As we learned in the previous chapter, the call to humility reads well as a final word for leaders (1 Peter 5:1–6) and the opening of his final counsel for everyone (5:6–14). Young men must submit to the elders, but everyone should wear humility like a garment, for “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble” (5:5).</p>
        <p>In an essential way, the Christian <span class="mini">must</span> be humble, for faith begins with repentance. We confess, “I am a sinner, unable to reform myself, and without hope, outside God’s sovereign mercy.” While there is a definitive, one-time humbling when we repent, we must <span class="mini">remain</span> humble. Then God promises to exalt us “at the proper time” as he judges it (1 Peter 5:6 <span class="smallcaps">ESV</span>). Fallen human nature is prone to pride and egocentricity. We often think we <span class="mini">deserve</span> to be prominent and to excel, so we resent barriers to our ascendance. But if we humble ourselves, we refuse to grumble about adversity. To the question “How are you doing?” we can honestly reply, “Better than I deserve.”</p>

        <h2>Cast Your Anxiety on the Lord</h2>
        <p>Peter’s people had problems, so he urges them, “Cast all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you” (1 Peter 5:7 <span class="smallcaps">NRSV</span>). There is an innate antagonism between pagan polytheism and Christianity. The monotheism and exclusivity of the faith were affronts to Rome’s religions and way of life. New Christians faced the loss of friends, social status, livelihoods, even life itself—each of which, of course, could induce anxiety.</p>
        <p>Notice that <span class="mini">anxiety</span> (<span class="mini">merimna</span>) is singular. We normally think of anxieties in the plural. We worry about work, health, relationships, and a too-dense schedule. Problems roll in like waves, but they can congeal into one mass of anxiety. If we pay attention, we sense the big Anxiety in our friends—and our friends can see it in us. We can weather modest problems, arriving singly, but when one great problem falls on us, or a cluster arrives, we feel it differently.</p>
        <p>Peter commands us to take our anxiety and throw, toss, or cast it onto God. As we throw a bag of gym clothes into a car or hoist a saddle onto a <span>horse, so we should toss our anxiety on the Lord.<sup>1</sup>He is mighty and he will exalt us at the right time, because <span class="mini">our</span> cares are <span class="mini">his</span>.</span></p>
        <p>Jesus tells us not to be anxious: “Do not worry about your life.” Pagans constantly worry, asking what they will eat, drink, or wear. If we trust God, we don’t wear ourselves out chasing these things, for we know that our Father will feed and clothe us (Matt. 6:25–32). We should not indulge our worries.</p>
        <p>Yet Paul admits that he has anxiety (<span class="mini">merimna</span> again). He lists his troubles as an apostle—the beatings and jails, the hunger, thirst, cold, and shipwreck—and then concludes, “And, apart from other things, there is the daily pressure on me of my <span class="mini">anxiety</span> for all the churches” (2 Cor. 11:28 <span class="smallcaps">ESV</span>). So Paul has anxiety and apparently sees it as a <span class="mini">problem</span> but not as a <span class="mini">sin</span>.</p>
        <p>From this we conclude that anxiety is normal in some circumstances and that it’s possible to be anxious and yet not sin, if we address it properly. Specifically, we neither panic nor attempt to solve our problems autonomously. Suppose someone is anxious about his or her inability to find a job or to conceive a child. We should do what we can to solve the problem and ask God to bless our actions (Ps. 90:17). Yet even as we act, we should pray, “Lord, I’ve done what I can; now I leave the results to you. My fears weigh me down, and I give them to you.”</p>
        <p>Grammatically, 1 Peter 5:7 is subordinate to 5:6, and it’s easy to see how that subordination works.<sup>2</sup> We humble ourselves before God, in part, by giving our cares to him. We do that by remembering what Peter just said: God is mighty, he exalts us in his time, and he cares for us (5:6–7).</p>

        <h2>Resist the Devil</h2>
        <p>But God isn’t the only spiritual being who takes interest in us. An evil foe stands behind our visible enemies. Peter warns, “Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour” (1 Peter 5:8 <span class="smallcaps">ESV</span>).</p>
        <p>Conventional Christian wisdom rightly observes that we make two mistakes regarding Satan. We can take him too seriously, as if he possessed God’s omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence. But he is an angel, and like all other creatures, he is in one place at a time, has areas of ignorance (see notes on 1 Peter 3:19), and has finite power. Indeed, Michael the archangel is presented as his peer in Revelation 12:7ff. On the other hand, we can fail to take him seriously enough, reducing him to a cartoon villain. First Peter states the essentials</p>
        <p>First, the term <span class="mini">devil</span> translates a Greek word meaning “deceiver,” for he does seek to deceive (Zech. 3; Rev. 20:2). Second, he is dangerous. Hungry and wounded lions attack, and Satan, whose name means “adversary” in Hebrew, is both.<sup>3</sup> His power is limited, but he walks around, looking for victims. Because the devil aims to deceive and then to devour, Peter warns us twice, “Be sober-minded; be watchful” (1 Peter 5:8 <span class="smallcaps">ESV</span>).</p>
        <p>Satan operates by tempting or enticing people to sin. One classic case is Satan’s attempt to persuade Jesus to use his powers selfishly. After Jesus fasted forty days, he was hungry, and Satan invited him to turn nearby stones to bread (Matt. 4:2–3). We can imagine his words: “You’re hungry, aren’t you? You have the power, so why not? What’s the harm? Who gets hurt?” We guess at these lines because we have heard them ourselves. “Why not? Take what’s yours. You deserve it. No one will suffer and no one will know.”</p>
        <p>Satan has additional tactics. He incites idolatry, the worship of anything but the true God (Matt. 4:8–9). He also tempts us to doubt our standing with God (Rev. 12:10). He confuses or blinds people so that they cannot see the truth (2 Cor. 3:14–16). Today it seems that he has blinded Western societies ethically. Notice how we talk about ethics. People are no longer evil or perverse; they adopt alternative lifestyles. Deeds are no longer right or wrong; they are appropriate or inappropriate. That implies that wicked acts are nothing worse than breaches of etiquette. If someone offers us a chance to do evil, we don’t say, “That’s wrong”; we say, “I’m not comfortable with that,” as if comfort were a moral category. But the right course of action is often intensely uncomfortable, and the path to evil will be comfortable if habit makes it familiar. Satan is probably quite pleased when we do what is <span>comfortable and shun what is not. How readily our essential but difficult duties would fall away.</span></p>
        <p>“Resist him, standing firm in the faith,” Peter commands (1 Peter 5:9). James adds, “Resist the devil, and he will flee from you” (James 4:7). It’s hard to resist the devil, and at first, the longer we resist, the harder it feels. Suppose you accidentally start to divulge something before you recall that it’s confidential. You pause, and a friend begins to plead, “Come on, tell me! I can keep a secret, I promise.”<sup>4</sup> As he begs and guesses, the pressure builds. It eases if you break your silence. Yet if the intensity of the temptation increases as we resist it in the short term, it falls off in the long term, as we keep resisting sin. Most addicts see this when they break with addictive use of alcohol, drugs, or tobacco. The longer we break with lying or the use of pornography, the easier it is to stay away from those sins.</p>
        <p>One way to resist sin is to flee temptation. Paul advised, “Flee from sexual immorality” (1 Cor. 6:18) and “flee from idolatry” (10:14). He told Timothy to flee from love of money, to “flee the evil desires of youth,” and to “pursue righteousness” (1 Tim. 6:11; 2 Tim. 2:22).</p>
        <p>When we resist Satan, he must seek <span class="mini">another</span> opportune moment to tempt us, as Luke 4:13 points out. But when we capitulate to temptation, we offer him <span class="mini">more</span> time to do his will with us. When we succumb once, it’s easier to sin again, as we form sinful habits. We form pathways and gain skill at sinning, since practice, even at sin, makes us more efficient.</p>
        <p>Resistance to temptation should be both individual and communal. God’s grace trains us to “renounce worldly passions,” so that we are responsible, as individuals, to monitor our internal life. Each individual is responsible to say No when sin presents itself (Titus 2:11–12). Yet the command to resist the devil is, like the other commands here, addressed to <span class="mini">you</span>, plural. We are part of the church, and together we strive to live faithfully.</p>
        <p>Let me illustrate the individual and communal aspects of resistance of Satan. A friend of mine is both a dedicated disciple and an alcoholic. He has stayed clear of alcohol <span class="mini">almost</span>continually for twenty years. Sadly, he has strayed a couple of times, when alone and under great pressure. As an <span class="mini">individual</span>, he is responsible to recognize moments of weakness. When alone, he must resist the temptation to sneak a drink. But he is not funda<span>mentally alone. He is in community with other sober alcoholics. He has friends who pray for him and ask him about his faithfulness. If a group of men is having a beer, some will drink water or juice with him as a sign that they stand with him. In this way he resists Satan both as an individual and as a member of God’s family. </span></p>
        <p>Peter shows his interest in Christian solidarity when he says that we know that our “brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of sufferings” (1 Peter 5:9b). Because we face the same sorts of trouble, we should be more resolute to resist temptations. This is essential, since there is no reason to think persecution will cease, as Paul Achtemeier observes:</p>
        <p class="blockquote">The opposition the Christians face from their non-Christian contemporaries is not something they can avoid by modifying their behavior or adapting their beliefs . . . to escape such opposition. Only by completely abandoning the gospel and the community shaped by it, only by submitting to the satanic forces that stand in total opposition to God, can they escape the persecutions they otherwise face.<sup>5</sup></p>

        <h2>By God’s Grace</h2>
        <p>Peter closes his epistle with the assurance that the outcome of our life rests more on God’s power and grace than on our labors: “ And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast” (1 Peter 5:10). This is good news. God, the source of all grace, has called us to “eternal glory.” Still, suffering precedes glory (4:13), so we must suffer “a little while” before he restores and strengthens us. Peter uses four nearly synonymous verbs, all in the future tense, to emphasize God’s promise. The four promises rise in “a rhetorical crescendo.”<sup>6</sup> God himself will restore us, establish us, strengthen us, and set us on a firm foundation. All of this happens “in Christ,” that is, through our union with him, and by God’s eternal power. Thus, as God one day sets creation right and removes the sin that drives all suffering, he pledges to restore us, too.</p>
        <p>The promise of saving grace applies to many things. For example, if <span class="mini">God</span> calls his people to glory, then parents do not issue that call. That is a helpful antidote to what Scotty Smith has called “Messianic parenting.” Messianic parents dream that if we do everything right—live well, love well, tell Bible stories well, and stay cool with our teens—all will <span class="mini">be</span> well in the end. But our performance, which is more flawed than we like to admit, doesn’t save our children. God does, and he can accomplish all he wills and promises, because his is “the power for ever and ever” (1 Peter 5:11)</p>

        <h2>Greetings and Blessings</h2>
        <p>Since Peter often tells his people to stand together (1 Peter 5:1–3, 5, 9), it is fitting that he mention his colaborers, Silvanus and Mark, as he closes: “By Silvanus, a faithful brother as I regard him, I have written briefly to you, exhorting and declaring [or <span class="mini">testifying</span>] that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it” (5:12 <span class="smallcaps">ESV</span>).</p>
        <p>The phrase “by Silvanus” means either that the epistle was delivered by Silvanus or that Peter wrote through him. <span class="mini">Silas</span> and <span class="mini">Silvanus</span> are probably variant forms of one name, like <span class="mini">Pete</span> and <span class="mini">Peter</span>. Most scholars believe the Silvanus mentioned here is the Silas mentioned seventeen times from Acts 15 to 18.<sup>7</sup> That is why some translations (e.g., <span class="smallcaps">NIV</span>) render the name <span class="mini">Silas</span> and others render it <span class="mini">Silvanus</span> (e.g., <span class="smallcaps">ESV</span>; the Greek letters in 5:12 are closer to <span class="mini">Silvanus</span>).</p>
        <p>In the short phrase “by Silvanus,” the word <span class="mini">by</span>translates the Greek word <span class="mini">dia</span>, which can mean “by” or “through.” If Peter wrote <span class="mini">through</span> Silvanus, then Silvanus wrote the actual words of the letter. He might have taken dictation as Peter spoke. But that seems unlikely, since the letter has complex and elegant sentences, suggesting skillful, painstaking composition. Others think Peter wrote through Silvanus because he was an amanuensis, a literary secretary who had freedom to express Peter’s thoughts as he judged appropriate. Some scholars are drawn to this idea, since they wonder how Peter, a Galilean fisherman, could acquire the substantial literary skill that the epistle displays. The <span class="smallcaps">NIV</span> translation seems to support the view that Silas/ <span>Silvanus aided the composition of 1 Peter when it translates our phrase “with the help of Silas” in 5:12. </span></p>
        <p>But the notion of a literary secretary has flaws. First, it is speculative; there is no evidence that Silvanus had literary training. Second, talent can surface outside schools; many great writers have no formal training.<sup>8</sup> Third, if Silvanus did compose 1 Peter, it seems boastful that he would call himself “a faithful brother as I regard him” (5:12 <span class="smallcaps">ESV</span>). And who would be the <span class="mini">I</span> in the sentence “With the help of Silas, whom <span class="mini">I</span> regard as a faithful brother, <span class="mini">I</span> have written to you” (<span class="smallcaps">NIV</span>)? For him to promote himself in that way would clash with Peter’s teaching on humility.</p>
        <p>Some say that it hardly matters who wrote the words of 1 Peter, since we know the essence is Peter’s and since the Holy Spirit is the animating and guiding Author (cf. 1 Peter 1:10–12). But there is reason to believe that Silvanus delivered the letter, so that it came <span class="mini">by</span> his hand. In the Greek, the phrase “by Silvanus” resembles Acts 15:22–23, where the Jerusalem Council appointed respected messengers, including Silvanus himself, to deliver a letter to the entire church. Finally, it makes sense to call Silvanus a “faithful brother” if he delivered the letter. The messenger might need to explain aspects of its contents, and Peter’s commendation would lend him authority to do so.<sup>9</sup> We also see Peter’s interest in securing a good reception for his letter when he says that he has written “briefly,” for brevity was considered good form and length a burden in that day.</p>
        <p>Peter also describes the letter itself, asserting that it exhorts and testifies that this is the true grace of God. “This is the true grace” (1 Peter 5:12b) refers to the whole letter, which began with God’s election, moved to Jesus’ atoning death, resurrection, and ascension, and closed with God’s promise of “eternal glory in Christ” (5:10). The gospel, Peter declares, is true, and trust in Jesus is trust in the living God. Jesus is no mere man, the gospel no mere story. It is the truth about the eternal and gracious God. None of this <span>is in doubt, but humans are fickle, so Peter commands his people to “stand fast” in this grace (5:12).<sup>10</sup></span></p>
        <p>Next, Peter, along with Mark, the longtime companion of Paul and Barnabas before he joined Peter (Acts 12:12, 25; Col. 4:10; Philem. 24), sends a greeting. “She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you her greetings, and so does my son Mark” (1 Peter 5:13). As we have noted, “Babylon” is not the literal city, but code for “Rome.” If the gods that oppose the faith are oppressive power, materialism, and false religion, Rome and Babylon are two cities that offered both power and wealth, both violence and sensual indulgence (Isa. 46–47; Rev. 17–18). If Peter dwells in Rome/ Babylon, his flock should see that he stands with them. Even if many miles separate the apostle and the churches, they live in the same setting.</p>
        <p>Finally, Peter commands his people to stay together locally: “Greet one another with a kiss of love” (1 Peter 5:14). The kiss of love meant the ritual touch of cheeks, not lips. Further, the kiss was given from man to man or woman to woman, not man to woman.</p>
        <p>In the empire, the kiss of greeting was common when friends or family reunited. But not everyone kissed. The kiss demonstrated friendship, kinship, and affection. The Ephesian elders kissed Paul when they saw him for the last time (Acts 20:37). In Jesus’ parable, the father kisses the prodigal son (Luke 15:20). But a Pharisee proves that he has no love for Jesus when he offers no kiss (7:45).</p>
        <p>The command to “greet one another with a kiss of love” reminds us of Peter’s emphasis on love in God’s household. Love is our prime disposition and main action, our sign of solidarity. First Peter 1:22 said, “Love one another deeply, from the heart.” We also notice the phrasing of 2:17, “Show proper respect to everyone: love the brotherhood of believers.” So we <span class="mini">respect</span> everyone, but we <span class="mini">love</span> the brotherhood. Since love must show itself in unity, we should “live in harmony with one another; . . . love as brothers, be compassionate and humble” (3:8). Love also heals breaches: “love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins” (4:8). Peter also sprinkles family metaphors through his letter. God is our Father, and we are “obedient children” (1:14) who have been “born again” (1:23). Since we belong to a new and loving family (1:17–18, 22; 5:9), we should seal our ties with “a kiss of love.”</p>
        <p>Joel Green says that the kiss of love has traits that shape the Christian’s world. The kiss generated a sense of identity and focused attention on believers’ shared life. The visual, tactile act sealed “the community’s essential commitments with physical demonstration.” They had suffered hostility and alienation from the pagan world; now the kiss affirmed that they belonged in a loving family. The kiss of love strengthened “patterns of thinking and feeling” and a “quality of life, determined by the merciful initiative of God who brings liberation in Christ and creates a household structured around his grace.”<sup>11</sup></p>
        <p>The kiss of love is still known in many cultures, but where the practice is alien, we find other ways to demonstrate our affection. That could be a handshake or a hug. Physical affection is important, as the fivefold command to greet with a kiss shows (Rom. 16:16; 1 Cor. 16:20; 2 Cor. 13:12; 1 Thess. 5:26; 1 Peter 5:14; cf. Luke 7:45; Acts 20:37). But the custom must be grounded in reality. We need genuine ties for the <span class="mini">signs</span> of affection to carry weight. It’s awkward, not helpful, to hug a stranger. We need relationships and must take time to form them.</p>
        <p>Even the great apostles Peter and Paul never wanted to be alone; they needed loving relationships, too. As Peter wrote, Silvanus and Mark were with him. He wanted the whole church and each church to know the benefits of familial love. At the least, we more richly experience grace when we are together. We help each other stand in God’s grace. This is one way that Jesus, the Chief Shepherd, cares for us as we move toward the eternal glory that God promises us. All of this allows Peter to conclude with a simple but profound benediction: “Peace to all of you who are in Christ” (1 Peter 5:14).</p>

        <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
        <p>So we have finished our journey through 1 Peter. How beautiful to receive God’s peace at its conclusion. How fitting that Peter, who betrayed the Lord and received the grace of forgiveness, closes his epistle by offering his churches the grace of God. His letter began, “Grace and peace be yours in abundance” (1 Peter 1:2). He concludes, “I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast <span>in it” (5:12). The apostle’s talk of grace is not formulaic. Peter denied Jesus three times, swearing on oath that he did not even know him. Yet when Peter repented, Jesus both forgave him and reinstated him as an apostle. Because of the depth of his sin, Peter loved the grace of God. </span></p>
        <p>But Peter offered no cheap grace. He called the church to a holiness grounded in the work of Christ. Because God is holy, we are holy. Because Jesus ransomed us, we put away sin (1 Peter 1:13–2:3). Because we are God’s holy nation, we abstain from sin and live honorably, even if slandered (2:4–12). Holiness manifests itself socially, in submission to governors and masters (2:13–25), and it shows itself in the home (3:1–7). Peter says that disciples can ordinarily expect to “see good days,” living in substantial peace, if we live well, treat others well, and seek peace (3:8–13). Still, it is possible to suffer for doing good (3:13–17). Jesus did so when he died for us and so liberated us from death (3:18–22). Jesus’ example prepares us for opposition from the Gentiles (4:1–6). Nonetheless, the disciples’ eyes are not always on possible troubles. We are self-controlled, loving, hospitable, and quick to use God’s gifts to administer God’s grace (4:7–11). The elders of the church lead God’s flock in all this, setting an example and watching over all (5:1–5). So we hope to stand firm in God’s grace and enjoy the peace of Christ (5:7–14).</p>

          <p class="footnote">1. See Luke 19:35, where the disciples <span class="mini">cast</span> (using the same Greek word, <span class="mini">epiripto</span>) their cloaks onto a donkey so that Jesus could ride it.</p>
          <p class="footnote">2. The verb <span class="mini">cast</span> is not an imperative, but a participle (<span class="mini">epiripsantes</span>). Participles that follow imperatives are commonly imperatival—this one follows the command to “humble yourselves”—so the translation is good. Still, a participial clause is subordinate to the main clause. Thus, “cast all your anxiety” is subordinate to “humble yourselves,” so that Peter presents “cast all your anxiety” as one way in which we humble ourselves.</p>
          <p class="footnote">3. The lion metaphor might also suggest that the devil is frightening. Lions are large predators, known to threaten humans, and at close range their roar, in decibels, nearly matches that of a jet airplane. Also, note the flexibility of biblical metaphors, for Jesus is also called a Lion in Revelation 5:5.</p>

The name was fairly common, and Peter is traditionally dated at <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 65–70, that is, twenty to twenty-five years after the events recorded in Acts 15, so that Silas might easily have already died.</p>
