        <h1>14. Gifts from God, Gifts for God</h1>
        <p class="center" style="font-family:NuptialScript;font-size:2em;margin-bottom:2em">1 Peter 4:7–11</p>
        <p class="center" style="margin:0 3em 3em 3em"><span class="mini"> Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God’s grace in its various forms. If anyone speaks, he should do it as one speaking the very words of God. If anyone serves, he should do it with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever</span>. (1 Peter 4:10–11)</p>
        <p style="text-indent:0"><span class="dcap bgcolor">O</span>ne summer I spoke at a family camp in Pennsylvania’s Nittany Mountains. Our eldest daughter was seven, and we gave her the run of the place, including the rolling woods on the edge of the<span/>camp. For hours, she explored fallen logs and thin streams, capturing small creatures. One day, she burst into our room with a box of plants, bugs, and red-spotted newts and declared, “I was <span class="mini">made</span> for this.”</p>
        <p>The label for that sensation—<span class="mini">I was made for this</span>—is <span class="mini">optimal experience</span>or <span class="mini">flow</span>. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi described <span class="mini">flow</span> as complete immersion in an activity “for its own sake. The ego falls away. Time flies. Every action, movement, and thought follows inevitably from the previous one . . . . <span>Your whole being is involved, and you’re using your skills to the utmost.”<sup>1</sup> A professor once said, “I teach for free; they pay me to grade papers.” For him, teaching was an optimal experience. During optimal experiences, self-awareness fades. The hours speed by, yet time also slows down as we concentrate on the moment. For athletes, balls seem large and opponents seem slow. For speakers, each word proceeds with both logic and passion from the one before and there is oneness with the audience. Hunger, thirst, and weariness cannot interrupt, and distractions fade away. Blessed is the man who often experiences flow.<sup>2</sup> </span></p>
        <p>We can feel that we are made for something when we exercise our God-given gifts. Gifts equip believers for service in God’s kingdom—for the church first, but also for work in the wider world. For the sake of discussion, let me propose that God grants <span class="mini">abilities</span> to all people, believers and doubters alike. These abilities become <span class="mini">gifts</span> when we dedicate them to God and the Spirit wills to make them fruitful for his purposes. But before we explore a New Testament theology of gifts, we need to locate them in the message of 1 Peter 4:7–11.</p>

        <h2>Living Faithfully in Community</h2>
        <p>Since 1 Peter 4:5–6 says that all flesh must render an account to God, who judges “the living and the dead,” Peter easily shifts, in 4:7, to the end of all things. More importantly, this passage concludes the long middle portion of 1 Peter, stretching from 2:11 to 4:11, describing the social conduct of a disciple. First Peter 2:11–12 is the overture, as the apostle urges his beloved readers to “abstain from sinful desires, which war against your soul,” and to “live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing  wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.” The outline is simple: abstain from evil, do good, and remember the last day. First Peter 4:7–9, similarly, urges that disciples keep a clear mind and do good, while remembering the times.</p>
        <p>The Greek has an untranslated conjunction, <span class="mini">de</span>, that loosely connects 1 Peter 4:6 and 4:7: The gospel is proclaimed because all humanity will be judged (4:6), and this is significant because “the end of all things is near” (4:7). The world as we know it, fraught with ambiguity at best and misery at worst, will not continue forever. When this age ends, Jesus will return to overthrow sin and establish his new order. Then creation will reach its proper end. This end “is near” not chronologically but theologically. Peter asserted that the end was near almost two thousand years ago, and he was right, because we have been brought into the final phase of God’s plan of redemption by the resurrection of Jesus and the gift of the Spirit.<sup>3</sup> Peter already noted that we are in the last times in 1:20, saying that Jesus “was revealed in these last times for your sake.” When this age ends, Jesus will return to overthrow sin and establish his new order. That day is near in the sense that it could happen at any time (cf. Matt. 3:2; 4:17; 10:7; 24:44; Mark 1:15)</p>
        <p>“Therefore,” Peter says, we must live in light of Jesus’ return and be clear-minded, self-controlled, prayerful, and full of love and forgiveness (1 Peter 4:7–8). Because we are in the last phase of God’s plan of redemption, because the end is near, certain conduct follows. These commands are the backbone of the passage:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be clear-minded and self-controlled so that you can pray (4:7b).</li>
          <li>Love each other persistently and unfailingly, and so cover sins (4:8).</li>
          <li>Offer hospitality to one another without complaining (4:9).</li>
          <li>Use the gracious gifts that God has bestowed to serve one another (4:10).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One could argue that Christianity is the most intellectually demanding of the faiths. It has robust and complex doctrines, and it regularly summons believers to be mindful of the implications of the faith and to let God’s truth govern their lives. Peter’s twin command, “be clear minded and self-controlled,” seems to be a hendiadys, with the two verbs functioning as one. To be clear-minded is to see things as they are and to act appropriately. The root of the verb translated “self-controlled” comes from a term that originally <span>meant “sober” rather than “drunk,” but came to mean “alert, sound-minded, and mentally disciplined.”<sup>4</sup>This promotes the life of prayer (cf. 1 Peter 3:7). This is no generic prayer, “but the prayer that calls upon and submits to God in the light of reality seen from God’s perspective and thus obtains power and guidance in the situation.”<sup>5</sup> </span></p>
        <p>The word <span class="mini">all</span> links 1 Peter 4:7 and 4:8. Because “the end of all things is near,” believers should, “above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins” (4:8). A disciple loves everyone, even his enemies, but Peter focuses on love within the Christian community. The reference to “grumbling” in 4:9 underscores the need to maintain Christian unity. The word <span class="mini">deeply</span> (Greek <span class="mini">ektenēs</span>) can describe an attitude of perseverance, earnestness, and eagerness, even devotion. Such love “covers” many sins not by covering them up, and not by atoning for them, since Jesus does that (1:18–19; 2:24). Rather, we cover sins by forgiving them. This is first taught in Proverbs 10:12: “Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all offenses” (<span class="smallcaps">ESV</span>). The phrase also appears in James 5:20, and we see the concept in Matthew 18:21–22; Luke 17:3–6; and 1 Corinthians 13:7. Further, such forgiveness is vital to Peter’s interest in preserving Christian community.</p>
        <p>Why does Peter claim that such love is “above all”? Because the church is a society of sinners, redeemed by grace. Because we are sinners who both offend each other and take offense when no real offense is given. We cannot hope for a strong Christian community if we fail to extend to one another the grace that the Lord first gave us. Church splits, at local and national levels, give sad testimony to the evil effects when such grace is missing. But Paul exhorts, “Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you” (Eph. 4:32). Love <span class="mini">includes</span> feelings (Rom. 12:10), but it is more than a feeling. Love is a resolve to do good to others, including the good of forgiving their sins.</p>
        <p>When Peter instructs, “Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling” (1 Peter 4:9), he shifts from the general principles of 4:7–8 to particulars in 4:9. Hospitality is a form of the love mentioned in 4:8. Indeed, the Greek term for <span class="mini">hospitality</span>, <span class="mini">philoxenos</span>, is a compound formed from <span class="mini">philos</span>(<span class="mini">love</span>) and <span class="mini">xenos</span> (<span class="mini">stranger</span>). Hospitality is a specific form of love: caring for strangers, who might be part of the Christian mission. Of course, believers <span>with larger homes are most capable of offering hospitality. The little phrase “without grumbling” reminds us that hospitality can be burdensome. Yet hospitality is necessary, given the imperative of Christian mission and the lack of decent lodging, in that day, for travelers. This implies that all the service we offer each other should be humble and joyful. </span></p>
        <p>Throughout, Peter stresses mutuality, as we see in the repeated use of “one another.” He says that Christians must “keep loving one another” (1 Peter 4:8), “show hospitality to one another” (4:9), and exercise our gifts to “serve one another” (4:10, all <span class="smallcaps">ESV</span>). These are universal obligations, but we are most likely to help one another cheerfully—“without grumbling”—and effectively when we act within our God-given endowments.</p>
        <p>Peter speaks to every Christian, not just elite believers or church officers, when he urges, “Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others” (1 Peter 4:10). We serve others because our gifts ultimately belong to God, not to us. We are “good stewards of God’s varied grace” (4:10 <span class="smallcaps">ESV</span>; cf. Rom. 12:6). God’s gifts are gracious in two senses: (1) they are given widely and freely, and (2) they are bestowed apart from human merit.</p>
        <p>Because we <span class="mini">receive</span> gifts from God, they are never simply <span class="mini">ours</span>. Gifts in some senses do, and in some senses do not, belong to us. We receive them from God, but they are not our possession or trophy. There is no room for pride, and we have no right to view them as a windfall.</p>
        <p>Paul says that those who hold office are stewards of God’s grace (e.g., 1 Cor. 4:1–2; Titus 1:7). But 1 Peter 4:10, like Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12, asserts that every believer is a steward of God’s grace. For Peter, <span class="mini">grace</span> usually means the gift of salvation awaiting all who believe in Jesus (1 Peter 1:10, 13; 3:7). And to be sure, every gift, rightly exercised, <span class="mini">points</span> to God’s grace, but this passage is not saying that we steward or manage God’s <span class="mini">saving</span> grace. The grace of 1 Peter 4:10 is the grace that gives abilities and ministries to all.</p>
        <p>For most gifts, there is no office, so Peter speaks to all disciples, not officeholders. Nonetheless, the two main categories of gifts, speaking and serving, do correspond to the two principal church offices: “If anyone speaks [as elders do], he should do it as one speaking the very words of God. If anyone serves [as deacons do], he should do it with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen” (1 Peter 4:11). Teaching and ruling elders lead the ministry of words, and deacons lead the ministry of deeds.</p>
        <p>Peter says that speakers should act as if they utter “the very words [or <span class="mini">oracles</span>] of God” (1 Peter 4:11; <span class="mini">logia theou</span>). This is the exact phrasing of the Septuagint of Numbers 24:4, 16, where Balaam’s words are God’s words or oracles (cf. Rom. 3:2; Acts 7:38). Historically, church leaders and scholars have taken this as a comment on preaching. Chapter 1 of the Second Helvetic Confession famously says, “The preaching of the word of God is the word of God.” Earlier, Martin Luther said, “Every honest pastor’s and preacher’s mouth is Christ’s mouth . . . and the Word which he preacheth is likewise not the pastor’s and preacher’s but God’s.”<sup>6</sup> Similarly, John Calvin said, “When a man has climbed up into the pulpit . . . it is [so] that God may speak to us by the mouth of a man.”<sup>7</sup> So preaching is God’s Word in some sense, yet the preacher’s words are human, too, and therefore often garbled, weak, or even false. But the Spirit “makes the broken human words become . . . a living word of God to the hearers.”<sup>8</sup> Hebrews states that this happens in the church, and not only through the apostles: “Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you” (Heb. 13:7; cf. 1 Thess. 2:13; 1 Peter 1:25). Preachers can and must prepare, yet we must pray that the Lord will excise what is false, improve what is true, and apply all the truth, even things hinted at rather than articulated, to receptive hearts. At best, when a congregation hears Christ proclaimed, according to the pattern of Scripture itself, they hear more than explanation and application; they hear Christ himself, imploring them to believe and to live by grace. (At worst, a preacher knowingly contradicts Scripture.)</p>
        <p>Although we traditionally apply 1 Peter 4:11a to preaching, dialogical teaching that is Scripture-based and prayer-bathed can have the same “very words of God” status. Suppose a man strikes and threatens his wife and children. The wife, ashamed and afraid of a humiliating scandal, tells her pastor, “If I pray fervently and do nothing upsetting, I believe I can overcome my husband’s anger and violence.” A wise pastor might reply, “Mrs. Smith, I admire your endurance and devotion, but it is very likely that he will strike and threaten again, no matter what you do or how you pray. This case requires church leaders and, quite likely, civil authorities to stand with <span>you. God appointed church authorities to rebuke sin, and he summons civil authorities to strike fear in evildoers and punish them as necessary” (cf. Rom. 13:3–4). Strong pastoral counsel of this kind may also be God’s very Word. First Peter 4:11 also mentions those who serve. They give to the poor and needy, feed the hungry, welcome the stranger, and visit the sick and the prisoner. Some of them do the work; others organize it. Servants are also stewards of grace. Our service has greatest effect when it is performed not with grim resolve but “with the strength God provides” (1 Peter 4:11). If servants know that their strength and resources come from God, they will not condescend or patronize. Whether we speak or act, we focus on God, who is the source of all strength and every accomplishment. Then “God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory” (1 Peter 4:11; cf. Phil. 4:13; Rev. 5:12; 7:12).</span></p>
        <p>This passage harks back to 1 Peter 2:12. There Peter sees evildoers glorifying God (perhaps not willingly) on the day that God “visits” mankind, for they must acknowledge the good deeds of believers. In this chapter, Peter sees believers doing good and willingly giving God all praise and glory. This passage also looks to the end of Peter. A united, gifted, and God-centered church will endure fiery trials. It will live together well under Jesus, the Good Shepherd, and will await the day when Christ exalts us (4:12–5:10).<sup>9</sup></p>
        <p>Although we could stop here, the biblical theology of gifts is both important and somewhat misunderstood. We can therefore profit from an extended meditation on the biblical teaching.</p>

        <h2>A Theology of Gifts</h2>
        <p>The theological conviction behind the concept of gifts is simple: we “do not all have the same function” (Rom. 12:4). From the beginning, God created mankind for diversity within unity. Some serve, some teach, some lead (12:7–8). Christianity has a point of contact with pagan thought here: Aristotle said that a city-state is made of different kinds of men and finds life in its diversity.<sup>10</sup>Paul says that the church is like one body with many <span>parts or members (1 Cor. 12:12–30). We don’t all sing the same note. God created us for harmony. </span></p>
        <p>When God created this world, he cast his powers on the waters of humanity. He expected us to use our strength and creativity to give him a return on his investments (Eccl. 11:1). We each love some part of God’s creation and exercise our abilities within it. Each person reflects the character of God and the grace of Christ in a distinct way, so that we make a personal contribution to God’s design for our world, even while our work overlaps with that of many others. Each of us has tastes and insights. Each sees something discrete in a landscape. One regards a desert as dead and frightening; another rests in its austere beauty. Many love to see an unbroken succession of sunny days; others love mist and rain in the valley. At any point, our capacities, experiences, and tastes can lead us to unique service. Jesus promised, “To him who overcomes, I will give . . . a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to him who receives it” (Rev. 2:17). Because each of us has a unique name, insights, capacities, and interests, each can make a unique contribution to God’s work.</p>

        <h2>A Survey of Spiritual Gifts: Biblical Principles, Lists, and Terms</h2>
        <p>God bestows a persona and graces that equip each one to herald his kingdom and serve him. He has distributed gifts to every believer. Peter lists the gifts of the Spirit in 1 Peter 4:10–11. Paul’s lists appear in Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12–14, and Ephesians 4. These lists vary in size and content. Together, they mention about twenty gifts. Several cite teaching, prophesying, serving, encouraging, leading, giving, and healing, but no two lists are identical and none is exhaustive. None tries to enumerate and categorize all classes of God-given talent.</p>
        <p>Careful reading suggests that the lists are partial. First, each list diverges from the others. Even short lists can have terms that are missing in long ones. Second, some terms are listed as gifts in one place and a result of a gift in others: Encouraging is a gift in Romans 12:8, but a result of prophecy in 1 Corinthians 14:3. Knowledge is independent in 1 Corinthians 12:8 and a result of prophecy in 1 Corinthians 14:6. Third, music appears <span class="mini">with</span>the gifts of teaching, tongues, and interpretation in 1 Corinthians 14:26, but is never <span>listed <span class="mini">as</span> a gift. Similarly, hospitality is mentioned near gift lists (Rom. 12:13; 1 Peter 4:9), and it aids church life (Rom. 16:23; 1 Tim. 5:10; 3 John 8), but is never called a gift. Again, Moses reports that God gave Bezalel and Oholiab artistic skill to construct the tabernacle (Ex. 31:2; 35:30; 36:1–2), but artistry appears in no New Testament inventory. Thus, we miss the point if we try to specify the precise number and categories of gifts. The main lesson is simple: we have diverse gifts and must find and use them.>></span></p>
        <p>Curiously, the phrase we use most, “spiritual gifts,” never appears in the original Greek, although it appears in English translations of 1 Corinthians 12:1 and 14:1. Paul calls our spiritual abilities “gifts” (Eph. 4:7–8),<sup>11</sup> “service,” and “working[s]” (1 Cor. 12:5–6), “manifestation[s] of the Spirit” (1 Cor. 12:7), “spiritual things” (1 Cor. 12:1; 14:1; the Greek is <span class="mini">pneuma</span><span class="mini">tika</span>), and “measure of faith” (Rom. 12:3). Paul’s favorite term <span class="mini">charismata</span> (Rom. 12:6; 1 Cor. 12:9, 29–31) is a cousin of <span class="mini">grace</span> (<span class="mini">charis</span>) and means “gracious gifts.”</p>
        <p>Scripture calls our capacities <span class="mini">graces</span> because they are more than abilities. God gives them graciously, and they are <span class="mini">means</span> of grace for others. Peter says that the gifted “serve others, faithfully administering God’s grace in its various forms” (1 Peter 4:10). At best, gifts empower us to do God’s work and focus our attention on him and his grace (1 Cor. 12:7–11; 14:12). We distinguish the abilities possessed by the godless from the gifts of believers this way: we seek the glory of God as well as “the common good” (1 Cor. 12:7).</p>
        <p>All gifts are important. Just as the human body needs every part, so the body of Christ needs every member. We pay more attention to the head than to the lungs, but life requires both. We pay more attention to hands than feet, but need both (1 Cor. 12:14–21). Paul does mention “greater gifts,” but “greater” refers to more strategic service, not service that pleases God more (12:31; 14:1–5).</p>

        <h2>The Nature and Use of Gifts</h2>
        <p>Therefore, to discover our gifts, we can ask, “Am I fundamentally a speaker of words or a doer of deeds?” We all speak and act, but most of us do one<span/>more than the other. We should ask, “What do I do best? Where do I sense God’s pleasure? What do wise people ask me to do again and again?”</p>
        <p>A gift begins with a capacity that resides at the core of our being. It starts with something we can do with skill and joy. God distributed gifts and designed roles for all his children. As we add friends and mentors, we find opportunities to use our capacities. An individualized and possibly almost unique set of abilities may develop. We can discover a basic capacity and then refine it. A musical child might start on the piano but move on to the violin or trumpet. A child with an early interest in numbers, properly encouraged, might find a career in a specialized aspect of math.</p>
        <p>We discover our skills as we grow older, as we work with peers and superiors. I often found myself explaining lessons to my friends while in school and suspected that I might become a teacher. One day, when I was twenty, a campus ministry leader asked me to address our college group. When I stood up to speak, I felt energetic and intense, yet calm and connected to my fellow students. When I finished, a friend whispered, “I didn’t know you could do <span class="mini">that</span>.” I replied, “I didn’t either.” Whatever <span class="mini">that</span> is, I’ve been doing it ever since.</p>
        <p>My experience is common enough. Basic skills start to emerge at an early age. Observant adults see something, some knack. They invite a young person to work beside them. The youth thinks, “Yes! I want to try that.” He tries it and it works. Sometimes the success is partial, sometimes surprisingly advanced. The adult invites him to try it again, offering some coaching, and the skill ripens.</p>
        <p>It’s possible to present this visually. A core interest or ability spurs a disciple to do something beneficial for others. The desire leads to action, and the action leads to good results. Perceptive people then invite the gifted man or woman to serve again. In time, something formal might emerge, whether it be through regular, paid work or in a recognized volunteer position. Ideally, the more someone exercises a skill, the more the skill and pleasure grow. Thus we learn what we can and should do. Anyone can find a skill this way. It might or might not lead to a job and a paycheck, but if a spiritual gift is present, there will be spiritual fruit.</p>
        <p>Some wonder whether they are called to a form of Christian ministry that requires theological training. The church ought to give men and women opportunities to explore that. But every believer needs to pursue <span>his or her passions and abilities. The exploration of possible gifts leads to more than self-realization. </span></p>
        <div class="image">
          <img alt="images/himg-197-1.png" src="images/himg-197-1.png"/>
          <p><b>Fig. 14.1 Gifts and Calling</b></p>
        </div>
        <p>The discovery of our gifts can start with a question: “<span class="mini">Do I have a passion</span>to right a wrong or to remedy a deficit?” It can be an evil that we have seen firsthand. Eventually the passion gets legs. We create a plan, and then dive into messy reality. We realize that we need training to go further, and we get that training.<sup>12</sup></p>
        <p>We also ask, “<span class="mini">What people will I serve</span>?” Godly dreams aren’t selfish. They serve people who have suffered a wound or who face a deficit that we can remedy. Next, we can ask, “<span class="mini">Where shall I serve</span>?” Even if our work reaches across the globe, even if we travel constantly, there is a primary location and a specific group that most counts on us. We must know who they are.</p>
        <p>Finally, we ask, “<span class="mini">What burden will I bear</span>?” Every lasting call will bring glory and suffering, self-fulfillment and self-denial. We should aim to relieve suffering, do justice, restart a stagnant group, or tackle a tough project. <span>If we meet a clear need, whether physical, financial, legal, psychological, educational, spiritual, or relational, it will bring both satisfaction and pain. </span></p>
        <p>There should be a focal point, a core activity in our service. Jesus himself showed this. Because Jesus is Creator and Lord of all, all things belong within his sphere of interest. Still, he came in <span class="mini">one place, at one time, to serve one people</span>. He did many things: he healed, taught, made disciples. But above all he lived in perfect righteousness, died in perfect innocence, and rose perfectly restored, that he might bear the punishment for our sins, defeat death, and grant us eternal life.</p>
        <p>None of us has gifts and a calling as splendid as Jesus. Few become glorious leaders. Yet every role is important. In the 2008 Olympics, Jason Lezak was a relay specialist on the U.S. men’s swim team that was led by Michael Phelps, who was pursuing an unprecedented eight gold medals. When Lezak arrived, he owned four medals from prior Olympic relays, but had never won an individual medal, and some opined that he couldn’t win a big race. Lezak was the anchor of the 400-meter freestyle relay. The U.S. freestyle teams had won the silver in the last two Olympics. In this race, the favored French team gave a 0.6-second lead to Alain Bernard, the world’s best freestyle swimmer, for the final leg.</p>
        <p>If Lezak failed to catch Bernard, Phelps, who had swum the first leg of the relay, would fail, too. When Lezak entered the pool, no one gave him a chance to catch Bernard. Indeed, Bernard’s half-body lead grew to a full-body lead. But Lezak kept working. “You’re at the Olympics,” he told himself. “You can’t give up.” (Apparently, Olympic athletes think about quitting <span class="mini">during their greatest races</span>. Yet the internal compulsion given by their gift and the external discipline gained by training enable them to persevere.)</p>
        <p>Lezak started gaining with thirty meters to go. Bernard was losing steam, pressing to honor his prerace boast of smashing the Americans. With ten meters to go, Lezak was almost even. People were screaming, “He’s catching up!” With five meters left, the race was a dead heat as Lezak swam toward his bellowing teammates.</p>
        <p>Lezak and Bernard seemed to touch the wall simultaneously. Then the scoreboard flashed Lezak’s triumph. The man who couldn’t win the big race had won the gold with the fastest 100 meters <span class="mini">of all time</span>. The Americans had crushed the world record by four seconds and won on the strength of a relay specialist. Fans remember Phelps, who would eventually win eight <span>gold medals, and the image of him roaring at the finish line, every muscle straining. But Phelps, the greatest swimmer in the world, needed Lezak, the relay specialist, to win that race. Indeed, Lezak sealed the eighth gold with another relay victory that set a world record yet again. The world also has more relay specialists than independent stars. This applies in the church, too. </span></p>
        <p>Frederick Buechner observed, “The place God calls you to is the place where your deep gladness and the world’s deep hunger meet.”<sup>13</sup> If Buechner is right, then our call and work are provisional, for the world’s hungers shift. We might have core abilities and interests that remain through life, but as we grow, our interests and capacities change, so that our call may change, too. We need to ask, “Where can I do the most good? Where can I, broken and restored as I am, bring restoration to this broken world?” If we finish a task, having contributed what we could, we might need to move on, if God issues a new call.</p>

        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
        <p><span class="mini">A gift is a capacity and desire for ministry, given by God for regular use, to bear fruit in the church</span>. <span class="mini">Capacity</span> means gifted people’s ability to advance God’s kingdom. Gifted leaders mobilize people for causes. Gifted teachers are clear and compelling, so people learn. Encouragers listen, speak, and act to lift spirits.</p>
        <p><span class="mini">Desire</span> means the ordinary pleasure that we take in our gifts. Yes, prophets might need to deliver bitter words. But there is usually joy in prophecy. Leaders govern diligently. Those who show mercy do it cheerfully. Givers do so generously. Paul’s phrase “let him give generously” literally reads “let him give <span class="mini">with simplicity</span>” (Rom. 12:8). That is, if someone has the gift of giving, he or she needs no return, but simply gives. Giving itself is the reward. Givers say, “Please take this money. Please borrow our car. You will minister to us if you take our gift.” So it should be with all gifts. Leaders find satisfaction in helping people to accomplish their goals. The merciful are <span class="mini">glad</span> to help others. The gifted feel alive when they exercise their talents, even if doing so brings hardships, as apostleship did for Paul. If someone has a skill and dislikes using it, it probably is not a gift in the fullest sense.</p>
        <p><span class="mini">Fruit</span>results when the exercise of a gift strengthens God’s church, bringing maturity and edification to the body of Christ (Eph. 4:12–13). <span>Conversely, a talented musician or speaker will not bless the church if he or she seeks to entertain rather than inspire worship. Gifts are God-centered. </span></p>

        <h2>Categories of Gifts</h2>
        <p>The gifts are diverse, yet we can classify them.<sup>14</sup> Let me propose three categories. First, there are gifts of speaking and service, gifts of word or deed (<a href="#tab1">table 14.1</a>). Second, gifts can be more and less obviously supernatural (<a href="#tab2">table 14.2</a>). Third, gifts can be more public or more private (<a href="#tab3">table 14.3</a>).</p>

        <h3>Gifts of Speaking and Serving</h3>
        <p>Peter says, “<span class="mini">If anyone speaks</span>, he should do it as one speaking the very words of God. <span class="mini">If anyone serves</span>, he should do it with the strength God provides.” Through words and deeds, we administer God’s grace (1 Peter 4:10–11). This holds for everyone, not just elite believers or officeholders.</p>

        <h3>Gifts More Natural or More Supernatural</h3>
        <p>All gifts are supernatural, but gifts such as miracles, prophecy, and tongues are more obviously so. With gifts such as leadership, encouragement, and teaching, God heightens or consecrates common abilities. As gifted teachers prepare lessons, they use normal human skills.<sup>15</sup>But we do not prepare, or follow procedures, to perform a miracle. That power comes immediately from the Spirit.<sup>16</sup></p>

        <h2>Gifts as Heightened Forms of Regular Duties</h2>
        <p>A second look at the gift lists shows that God expects all believers to participate, at least occasionally, in exercising most gifts. Most gifts of the Spirit label qualities or activities that are required of all believers. Wisdom, knowledge, discernment, faith, evangelism, teaching, generosity, and mercy are all gifts, yet believers should pursue all of them.</p>
        <p>Typically, therefore, gifts entail a <span class="mini">heightened</span> capacity for something that others can do to a lesser degree.<sup>17</sup> We might call this the <span class="mini">Principle of Participation</span>. One implication is that no one should use a theology of gifts to dodge mundane tasks such as nursery duty, claiming, “That’s not my gift.” Anyone can serve.</p>
        <p>For example, wisdom is a gift, but the Bible says that all should pursue wisdom. We should listen to the wise and ask God for it (Proverbs; James 1:5). Similarly:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Discernment is a gift, but Paul tells us that everyone should “test everything. Hold on to the good” (1 Thess. 5:21 <span class="smallcaps">ESV</span>).</li>
          <li>Evangelism is a gift, but all should be able to give a reason for the faith that is in them (1 Peter 3:15).</li>
          <li>Faith is a gift, but all should believe in the Father and the Son (John 14:1).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We can develop the Principle of Participation by distinguishing between functions, roles, and offices in ministry. Christians may briefly exercise almost any spiritual <span class="mini">function</span>. Everyone can serve and should occasionally function there. A crusty old grump might see a sad person and say an encouraging word. A traveler can share her faith on an airplane even if she is no evangelist.</p>
        <p>When someone has skill and desire for a task, when his labors meet needs, so that wise people ask him to serve again, he moves beyond a function. Regular, fruitful service is a <span class="mini">role</span>. When work becomes customary, joyful, and effective, it might express a gift that leads to regular tasks in the kingdom.</p>
        <p>People can also fill a role, perhaps for a long time, even if they are not especially gifted. To speak personally, my main gifts are teaching and preaching, but leadership roles seem to pursue me. Either I have a leadership gift but can’t quite admit it, or I don’t have the gift but accept the role because I’m in the vicinity of a leadership deficit. Either way, I keep heeding calls to lead. Still, my work as leader (true to my nature) has a teacherly texture. Thus, my angle on leadership is cognitive rather than administrative. I have no interest in administration per se, yet administrative tasks impose themselves on me, since administration must occur if ideas and plans are to become realities. I might delegate the administration to others with greater gifts there, but I can’t ignore it. In this way, as needs arise, people with modest abilities might find vital but ill-fitting roles thrust upon them. Ideally, a gifts/service conversation goes like this:</p>
        <p class="blockquote">Leader: We need help with XYZ, and someone suggested that I call you. <br/>Servant: Wonderful. I’ve been praying for an opportunity to help with XYZ. <br/>Leader, later: Great job, servant! You really have a knack for it. <br/>Servant: You don’t need to thank me. I love to do it.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, some needs do not find eager servants. We can’t refuse to attend to them simply because they fail to match an internal sense of call. A person with modest interest and ability might take a role sacrificially. That person might find that it fits better than he or she imagined, and stay there. Or the person might shift out of it as soon as a gifted person surfaces.</p>
        <p>With gifts such as giving and encouraging, there is nothing more than a long-standing role. There is no office of encouraging. But a <span class="mini">role</span> can become an <span class="mini">office</span> if the church recognizes, calls, and consecrates someone for a formal leadership position. Officers meet known criteria for positions described in Scripture. An office is a formal position, formally bestowed. Officers are first tested, and then consecrated to lead God’s people (1 Tim. 3:10; 5:22). In the past, there were prophets, priests, kings, and apostles. Today, offices include elder, deacon, and perhaps evangelist. God equips elders to teach, lead, and shepherd. The technical name for a pastor in some traditions is <span class="mini">teaching elder</span>, since his emphasis lies there, but he leads, shepherds, and evangelizes, too. Yet to lead well, officers must <span class="mini">function</span> in many areas. Tough guys must encourage and shy folk must learn to speak. And many should be willing to move into areas of clear and urgent need, such as cleanup after a natural disaster.</p>
        <p>When we serve others, we get close to the character and plan of God. For when sin shattered his world, he came in space and time, among particular people, to solve our problem. After returning to the Father, he commissioned us, in all our diversity, to finish his work. At best, the redeemed have a name, and a set of gifts that let us bring God’s healing to this broken world. When the work is done, we don’t even need thanks. We say, “I was made for this.”</p>
